
Introduction
The concept of the Sustainable Development Goals1 was based on the earlier model of the Millennium Development Goals agreed in 2000 at the United Nations General Assembly for the period ending in 2015. The approaching deadline for the implementation of the \0xECMillennium 
Agenda triggered the debate on the priority directions for international cooperation in the area of development policy of the United Nations, with a perspective going beyond 2015. 
The negotiations of the post-2015 agenda covered four components, namely the Political Declaration, the Sustainable Development Goals, Global Partnership and implementation measures and the rules of reviewing and monitoring of the process. Following the two-year period of complex negotiation all the four components were agreed, including 17 Sustainable Development Goals and 169 targets. 
Poland, being an active negotiator of the 2030 Agenda, based its position on the assumptions of the Act of 16 September 2011 on development cooperation (Dz. U. [Journal of Laws] from 2017 item 2098, as amended). Their primary objective was to support the conditions for sustainable development of developing countries, in particular through the promotion and consolidation of democracy, respect for human rights, good governance and support for institution building. At the same time, we supported the position of the European Union and its Member States, stressing the strong link between sustainable development and democratisation. We emphasised that international support must be proportional to the potential in this respect. About energy, we pointed out the need to make the commitments on energy more realistic, including the share of renewable energy sources in the general structure of energy carriers and their availability. Regarding the climate, we were in favour of eliminating targets that could presumably affect the outcome of negotiations on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) prepared in New York, on 9th of May 1992 (Dz. U. [Journal of Laws] from 1996 item. 238), planned to be held in December 2015 in Paris.
At the United Nations Special Summit in 2015, during which the 2030 
Agenda was adopted, Poland was represented by President Andrzej Duda, who expressed the highest political support in Poland for the agreed goals.
Polandis commitment to present its voluntary review of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda at the national level2 already three years after it entered into force proves the countryis active involvement in this important process, which encompasses all development-related matters of the United Nations.
2018 is a special year for Poland, as it is the centenary of regaining its independence. It is also the year of summing up one hundred years of development of Polish economy, which included periods of prosperity, strong growth and implementation of breakthrough reforms, but also the ordeal	of	international	conflicts,	or	the	challenges	related	to	the	reconstruction and modernisation of the state in economic and social terms. 
The reborn Poland was a mix of several economic systems. The problems faced by the young state included e.g. integration of the transport system and reconstruction of the country after the partitions and	World	War	I,	with	insufficient	capital	and	reserves.	Industrialisation projects aimed at increasing the countryis economic potential. The Central Industrial District was established, under which several new urban centres and a number of modern factories were designed. During the interwar period, the port of Gdynia became the largest port on the Baltic Sea and one of the most modern ports in Europe. 
The economic boom in the new Poland was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II. After the fall of communism and the regaining of sovereignty in 1989, Poland returned to the group of leading European economies, drawing on the modernisation experiences of the Second Polish Republic and using new instruments related to its membership in the European Union.
All these experiences and achievements so far provide a strong basis for the continuation of great transformational changes. We believe it is necessary to further modernise public policies so as to achieve a better balance between growth factors and social and environmental needs. Sustainable development is a great challenge of modern times in which, drawing on the past experiences, we should make responsible decisions in order to build a civilisation worthy of the future generations. In line with Pope John Paul IIis maxim The future begins today, not tomorrow, we are aware of the need for immediate action and full involvement of all stakeholders in this great process of change towards sustainable development.
The correlation between peace and security and development, in particular sustainable development, becomes increasingly stronger. Relevant debates and related UN positions are formulated in various 
UN resolutions3.	The	most	significant	of	them	are	reflected	by	the	UN	
Security Council in its resolutions and decisions. As a non-permanent member of the Security Council, Poland considers it one of its priorities to support the Councilis efforts to uphold the international law. 
Active participation in the global climate policy is also crucial for Poland.	Our	efforts	focus,	on	the	one	hand,	on	fulfilling	international	agreements and commitments on climate protection and, on the other hand, on creating the conditions for an effective international debate in order to increase ambition and accelerate action. In December 2018, for the third time, Poland will host the most important global forum devoted to global climate policy: the 24th Session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP24), together with the 14th Session of Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Kyoto Protocol (CMP 14). Almost 40,000 delegates from around the world will participate in the event, including heads of government and ministers responsible for environment and climate issues. The aim of COP24 is to adopt a full package	implementing	the	Paris	Agreement,	the	first	international	agreement where all countries in the world commit to take climate protection measures. The implementation package will enable the practical	fulfilment	of	the	Paris	Agreement.	Therefore,	it	will	set	the	global climate and energy policy for the coming years. 

Executive summary 
This Report has been prepared to review Polandis achievement in the implementation of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) defined	in	the	United	Nations	Resolution	Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Poland declared that its	first	review	would	take	place	at	a	ministerial	session	of	the	UN	High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development in 2018. 
The adoption of the 2030 Agenda by the United Nations in September 2015 coincided with a broad public debate on defining a new approach to development policy and the need to identify and give new impetus to development in Poland. As a result, a model of responsible development was defined, in which economic factors, while respecting the natural environment, are balanced by social factors, in accordance with the principles of sustainable development. The aim of such an approach is to ensure sustainable economic growth based on new competitive advantages, equal access to	the	benefits	of	development	for	all	social	groups	and,	ultimately,	improving the quality of life of citizens. It is an important direction of changes in public policy. It brings back to social and economic life such values as solidarity, family and community, which for years have been nurtured in the culture and education of the nation.
2018 marks the centenary of Polandis regained independence after 
123 years of partitions. This is a special opportunity for us to present Polandis achievements on the road to sustainable development to the international community. We believe that our experiences, achievements and best practices constitute capital that can be used in the global process of building and consolidating responsible economic development.
In the Report, we list the national priorities for the achievement of 
SDGs and present the institutional and coordination mechanism that supports the process of effective implementation of SDGs in Poland. The key document through which the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals are implemented in Poland is the 
Strategy for Responsible Development (the SRD).4 It is an instrument of	flexible	management	of	the	countryis	development	processes,	setting priorities, directions and actions until 2030, the effect of which will be to improve the quality of life of citizens and the possibility to benefit	from	economic	growth	for	all,	in	accordance	with	the	no one will be left behind principle. 
The new development model for Poland presented in the SRD meets the expectations set out in the 2030 Agenda. The convergence of the SRD and the Agenda is noticeable in their objectives, priority areas and actions, as well as indicators. The priorities of the social and economic development of Poland have been defined in all three dimensions of sustainable development.
At the social level, Polandis priority is above all to reduce social exclusion, poverty and all kinds of social inequality, including its territorial dimension. The ultimate objective of all measures is to improve the quality of life of citizens. Moreover, we focus on the development of human and social capital through access to knowledge and education, improving competences and social cohesion.
At the economic level, Polandis priority is mainly to build a strong, modern industry and to support entrepreneurship. Investment in innovation, development of new technologies and high-value-added products, development of information technologies and full use of the digital revolution are crucial in this respect. In addition, we support the internationalisation of Polish enterprises and the creation of Polish brands abroad.
In the environmental dimension, Poland strives to improve the state of the environment and sustainable management of resources. Polandis objective is to increase the available water resources and to achieve high water quality, sustainable management of natural and geological resources, as well as effective waste management. Improving air quality in Polish cities remains a priority. 
Achievement of the abovementioned priorities will be supported by strengthening	the	efficiency	and	effectiveness	of	the	state	and	its	institutions. We strive to improve the quality of legislation, ensure efficient	administration,	strengthen	the	strategic	management	system	for development processes and break the practice of operating in isolation. 
We focus on cooperation, partnership and joint responsibility of public entities, businesses and citizens for the development processes. This is reflected	in	a	shift	from	an	administration	system	to	shared	management	and shared responsibility for the success of transformational changes. It is crucial to build social dialogue around the most important projects and broad social support and trust between public entities and their partners in order to achieve development goals. 
We also present the national approach to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals. We have decided to present the public policies implemented under all 17 SDGs, due to the strong correlation and links between the different social and economic areas to which they refer. We believe that only comprehensive and broad knowledge of the implementation of measures under each SDG allows us to reliably assess the effectiveness of our efforts and to measure the distance to the fulfilment	of	our	commitments.	Each	SDG	contains	a	brief	diagnostic	description,	identifies	the	priorities	of	Polish	public	policy	in	a	given	area and presents key measures for the implementation of the set priorities. In our opinion, the most measurable effects are achieved under	specific	measures	and	projects;	therefore,	with	each	SDG,	we	have	identified	strategic	government	projects,	the	implementation	of	which	contributes	to	the	achievement	of	a	specific	goal.	Moreover,	we	present examples of good practices under projects implemented by local government units, NGOs, entrepreneurs or local communities. 
The Report shows our experience in building partnership, dialogue and cooperation between the administration and stakeholders in order to create appropriate conditions for the promotion of the idea of sustainable development in Poland. We believe that our approach and the Partnership for the implementation of Sustainable Development Goals can constitute a good practice for other countries. We also formulate plans for the future, focusing on social and economic areas and public policies, which trigger the sustainable development of Poland. 
As it is vital to monitor the progress of SDGs implementation at the national level, the Report contains a statistical annex with a list of national indicators necessary to measure the effects of actions taken to implement respective SDGs. 
The Report was prepared using a participatory approach. This means that already at the drafting stage, organisations representing various stakeholder groups were involved. A dedicated Task Force for the Coherence between the SRD and the 2030 Agenda was appointed to prepare Poland for the Voluntary National Review 2018. The Task Force includes representatives of ministries, social organisations, social and economic partners, NGOs, public statistics, civil society, academia and youth. Ministerial coordinators have been appointed for respective SDGs and descriptions of individual measures and examples of best practices have been developed in cooperation with external partners. Moreover, the Report was subject to extensive public consultations in accordance with the no one will be left behind principle. 

Methodology of the Report
Leadership and coordination
 
The UN Resolution on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was adopted by the UN General Assembly on 25 September 20155, triggering the process of implementation at the global, regional and national level. By adopting the Resolution, all UN Member States agreed that it was necessary:
\0xEF to designate National Development Goals, which will refer to the 
Sustainable Development Goals adopted within the 2030 Agenda;
\0xEF to ensure the monitoring of progress at the national level - select indicators, implement a relevant monitoring and reporting system;
\0xEF to build partnership between administration, businesses and other stakeholders for a new model of development and SDGs implementation.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) played a leading role in the process of negotiating the provisions of the Resolution on the part of Poland. It cooperated with interested ministries and institutions. An important partner at this stage of works was the Statistics Poland which supported the MFA in matters related to the monitoring of the 2030 Agenda goals and related statistical indicators. After the entry into force of the 2030 Agenda, from 2016 its implementation at the national level was coordinated by the Ministry of Economic Development (MED) responsible, inter alia, for the implementation of tasks resulting from the management of development policy through the strategic coordination system and evaluation of public policies.
A special role in this process was performed by the Deputy Prime Minister (from 12 December 2017, the Prime Minister of the Government of the Republic of Poland), the Minister of Economic Development and Finance, together with subordinate institutions, who served as the countryis development management centre. Concentration of the managerial and coordinating function in the hands of the Minister of Economic Development and Finance responsible for economic policy, while ensuring effective mechanisms of cooperation with other ministries, allowed for the adoption of an integrated approach to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda in Poland, consisting in ensuring coherence between global Sustainable Development Goals and development priorities at the national level, as well as joint management for both processes. 
In January 2018, the Polish Government was reconstructed and competence and structural changes within ministries occurred. Coordination of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda at the national level was vested in the Ministry of Entrepreneurship and Technology (MET), considering the implementation of the sustainable development goals an opportunity for social and economic development. The Ministry of Entrepreneurship and Technology plays a leading role in the process of preparing Poland for the national review of the SDG implementation at the UN within the High-Level Political Forum on 
Sustainable Development. Other ministries involved on substance in the process were: the Ministry of Family, Labour and Social Policy; the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development; the Ministry of Health; the Ministry of National Education; the Ministry of the Environment; the Ministry of Energy; the Ministry of Investment and Economic Development; the Ministry of Maritime Economy and Inland 
Navigation; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; the Ministry of Justice; the 
Ministry of Sport and Tourism; the Ministry of Culture and National 
Heritage; the Ministry of Finance; the Ministry of Infrastructure; the Chancellery of the Prime Minister and the Statistics Poland.
The 2030 Agenda emphasises the importance of an effective system of monitoring and reporting on the achievement of its Goals. The whole process of monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals has been entrusted to public statistics. In Poland, the model is implemented through coordination of SDG monitoring activities, including reporting on indicators, both nationally and globally, by the Statistics Poland.
Regarding to the external dimension of implementation of the 2030 
Agenda, coordination is related to close cooperation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is responsible for development cooperation and ensuring coherence of Polish development cooperation priorities with the Sustainable Development Goals. The directions of activities have	been	defined	in	the	Multiannual	Development	Cooperation	Programme for 2016-20 and result from Polandis activity in this area on three levels: international, EU and national. Implementation is based on Annual Action Plans.
Works on the Report
 
For the purpose of preparation of the Polish review of the achievement of SDGs, a special Task Force for the Coherence of the Strategy for Responsible Development (SRD) by 2020 (with a perspective to 
2030) with the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals (SRD Coherence Task Force) has been appointed. The Task Force works within the Coordination Committee for Development 
Policy, which is a central platform for monitoring the process of management of Polandis development, including the implementation of the main development strategy, i.e. the SRD. By establishing the SRD Coherence Task Force within the Coordination Committee for Development Policy, the coordination and monitoring of SDG achievement in Poland was included in the process of strategic management of the country.
The Ministry of Entrepreneurship and Technology plays a leading role in the process of preparing Poland for the national review of the SDG implementation at the UN within the HighLevel Political Forum on Sustainable Development.
The tasks of the Task Force include:
\0xEF selection of national priorities for the SDG achievement in Poland based on the SRD, 
\0xEF ensuring a participatory process of preparing the national report for the purposes of the Voluntary National Review of the achievement of SDGs (VNR) by including representatives of government and local government administration as well as representatives of the society in the discussion,
\0xEF exchanging information, good practices and knowledge on creating conditions for effective SDG achievement in Poland,
\0xEF monitoring the progress in the implementation of the directions of development	defined	in	the	SRD	and	the	manner	the	implementation of these directions affects the achievement of SDGs in Poland.
 
The assumption of the Task Force\0xEBs operation was to invite representatives of various circles to cooperate in order to ensure their active participation in the process of building appropriate conditions for the effective implementation of SDGs in Poland. It has been ensured that the Task Force included members of each level of administration. Apart from experts representing respective ministries and the Statistics Poland, the Task Force comprises representatives of the regional and local level, including associations of voivodeships, districts and municipalities of Poland, as well as organisations associating cities and metropolises in the country. As a result, the achievement of SDGs in Poland has been embedded locally, extending the commitment to the achievement of SDGs to lower administrative levels. 
In line with the no one will be left behind principle, social and economic partners, including organisations associating employees and employers, were invited to cooperate within the Task Force. They include employersi organisations and trade unions, which are members of the Social Dialogue Council. This institution is a forum for tripartite dialogue in Poland and cooperation between employees, employers and the government, operating at the central level. 
The	Task	Force	also	includes	representatives	of	the	Public	Benefit	
Works Council, which is the body that institutionalises the principle of civil dialogue and cooperation between the public sector and the so-called third sector. It complements the institutions implementing the principle of social dialogue. 
Among the participants of Task Force meetings are also representatives of academic circles, organisations belonging to the UN family that are active in Poland, and youth organisations. In order to prepare the Polish review, UNICEF established cooperation with the UNICEF 
Youth Council, whose main objective is to present the position of the young generation on issues important from their point of view and of particular importance for their development. The Council is composed of representatives of 16 voivodeships and includes young people of all ages from cities and rural areas. In total, the Council has 32 members (2 persons from each voivodeship).
The works of the Task Force take place on a regular basis during meetings and in a continuous manner between meetings. The Task Force adopted a participatory model of preparing the Report. This means that the descriptions of particular parts of the Report were prepared by the members of the Task Force representing the ministries6, in cooperation with social and economic partners. For each chapter, ministerial coordinators have been identified, in accordance with the thematic and substantive competence. On the basis of sustainable development	priorities	for	Poland	identified	by	the	ministries,	the	Statistics Poland selected monitoring indicators and presented them in a statistical annex. The statistical annex was developed by Statistics Poland, which coordinates the process of monitoring the 2030 Agenda in Poland from the statistics point of view and reporting for the purposes of evaluation of the achievement of SDGs at the global level. The Report is therefore the result of a partnership between representatives of various circles.
The report was based on a number of sources, of which the crucial one was the Strategy for Responsible Development. Moreover, updated integrated development strategies and programme documents adopted by the Government were used. The data and information were also obtained from national analyses and studies on Polandis position in SDG	achievement,	identification	of	areas	of	measures	and	policies	for effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda, as well as studies and publications of international organisations: OECD7, UN8, EU9 and other institutions10. 
The draft report was subject to extensive consultations, in accordance with the consultation procedure for documents adopted in Poland by the Council of Ministers. 
Between 6 and 27 April 2018, the Report was submitted for interministerial consultations and broad public consultations. Public consultations were conducted in a multidimensional way - electronically and	by	submitting	the	draft	for	the	opinion	of	specific	circles	and	stakeholder groups. The draft Report was published on 6 April 2018 on the website of the Ministry of Entrepreneurship and Technology, providing an opportunity to submit comments using a dedicated form.
The draft Report was also submitted to a wide range of social partners for opinion.
Public consultations were conducted at the national and regional level	-	the	draft	document	was	submitted	to	Marshalis	Offices	and	Voivodeship	Offices.	The	document	was	also	submitted	to	the	Social	Dialogue Council for opinion.
In addition, the following groups were addressed by and participated in the consultations: business and employersi organisations, NGOs, and trade unions. 
The draft Report was also submitted to selected Parliamentary Committees. 
On 10 May, the Coordinating Committee for Development Policy adopted the information on the Report. 

National sustainable development priorities 
National development strategy
 
The 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals, based on development taking social, economic and environmental aspects into	account,	are	strongly	reflected	in	the	Polish	development	policy.	They were included in the vision of development formulated in the 
Strategy for Responsible Development (the SRD), adopted by the Council of Ministers in February 2017. 
Polish economy needs new development impulses that will ensure stable growth while improving the quality of life and the wealth of its citizens. To address these needs, the strategy presents a new model of development - responsible development, i.e. one which, by building a competitive advantage with the use of new growth factors, allows	the	participation	of	and	provides	benefits	to	all	social	groups	living in various parts of Poland. At the same time, within the new model,	the	needs	of	the	present	generation	will	be	fulfilled	without	reducing the opportunities of future generations. Therefore, the focus is not solely on the total size of GDP, but rather on its quality and the perception of the development processes in the context of their importance for the citizens. The strategy therefore focuses on social and economic development that ensures social inclusion, which is why it focuses directly on the people and subordinates economic activities to the achievement of objectives related to the level and quality of life of citizens.
The main objective of all activities and undertakings provided for in the SRD is to create conditions for increasing incomes of the Polish citizens along with increasing cohesion in the social, economic, environmental and territorial dimensions. Poland aspires to create legal, institutional and investment activities that will lead to: 
I. Sustainable economic growth increasingly driven by knowledge, data and organisational excellence; 
II. Socially sensitive and territorially sustainable development; 
III. Effective state and economic institutions contributing to growth as well as social and economic inclusion. 
The	measures	taken	under	the	three	specific	objectives,	defined	as	priorities, will be supplemented by the implementation of infrastructural projects and measures of a regulatory and institutional nature. There are plans to step up efforts to develop human and social capital, including education, culture and health, in the area of transport, energy production and distribution, and ensuring a sustainable environment.
The implementation of social and economic objectives will be supported by the strengthening of the national security potential enabling the prevention and counteracting of contemporary threats.

Diagram 2.  	Overall objectives of the Strategy for Responsible Development
The expected effect of the implementation of the Strategy will be to increase the wealth of the Poles and reduce the number of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion. As a result, the quality of life will be improved by creating favourable living conditions, in particular for families, ensuring appropriate quality of education, increasing employment and better quality jobs. It is also expected that access to infrastructure will improve, high-quality medical care will be provided, satisfactory state of the environment will be maintained and that citizens will feel safe. The most important long-term effect for the economy will be the change in the structure of Polish GDP as a result of the increased role of innovation in its generation.

Active state policy is important for founding the economy on new development factors. The aim is to improve strategic decision-making, provide an appropriate legal framework for conducting a selective investment policy in the economic, social and territorial dimensions, with the use of current and potential comparative advantages. Active state policy at the same time means cooperation and sharing responsibility for the actions with entrepreneurs, scientists and citizens. The Strategy for Responsible Development sets out a number of strategic choices within the state policy framework, which are the point of reference in the construction of all policies, programmes and implementation projects.

\0xEF increasing the concentration of regional policy on problem areas and territorial potential of urban and rural areas; 
\0xEF identification	of	key	infrastructure	investments.

Such	a	wide	range	of	activities	requires	securing	financial	resources	for their effective implementation. The objectives of the SRD will be	financed	primarily	from	national	public	funds,	EU	public	funds,	
other foreign sources, as well as private funds including loans, leases and credits, also guaranteed or backed by entities authorised to grant guarantees or sureties. The size of those funds has been estimated in	the	SRD,	while	more	detailed	estimates,	including	the	financial	
exposure of potential private stakeholders, will be set out in the implementation documents for the SRD.
The new model of development for Poland outlined in the Strategy defines development challenges for our country and meets the expectations formulated in the 2030 Agenda.

Source: Own study.

The 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals, which integrate the three dimensions of development - economic, social and environmental - while pointing out the special role of partnership cooperation of a wide range of stakeholders towards their implementation, constitute a global and universal development plan. By promoting a participatory approach and dialogue for the implementation of joint initiatives, implementation of the 2030 Agenda creates an opportunity not only to make a difference in the country, region and the world, but also to act more effectively and to share the responsibility related to the implementation of public policies between public entities, business and citizens. The implementation of the 2030 Agenda is also an opportunity to strongly link the strategic directions of development in various areas to build a sustainable future.
The concept of sustainable and responsible development on which the SRD is based is consistent with the ambitious vision of the 2030 Agenda, i.e. a world free from poverty where everyone has the opportunity	to	benefit	from	all	three	dimensions	of	sustainable	development.	The measures envisaged in the Strategy were planned until 2020 with a perspective to 2030. The convergence of the SRD and the Agenda is noticeable in their objectives, priority areas and actions, as well as indicators.

National SDG achievement priorities 
 
The SRD, which is a response to the challenges faced by Poland in the 21st century, offers room to take advantage of new opportunities in economic processes related e.g. with the digital revolution, robotisation, technological progress, at the same time giving hope that all	social	groups	would	benefit	from	the	effects	of	growth.	It	sets	the	directions for effective cooperation within industries and between different sectors of the economy. 
For Poland, increasing the role of human and social capital, which is the basis for the development of its economy, is the key to building sustainable basis for growth. The priority direction of the measures is, above all, the reduction of social exclusion, poverty, all kinds of social inequalities, improvement of the quality of life, access to knowledge and education, improvement of competences, improvement of health care [SDGs 1, 3 and 4]. 
In the economic area, Poland considers it a priority to build a strong industry, support entrepreneurship in all its dimensions (including increasing the competitiveness of agricultural holdings and agri-food producers, development of the sector of highly productive services), consistent and comprehensive investment projects with particular focus on innovations, foreign expansion of Polish businesses, making the most of the achievements of the digital revolution, dynamic development and dissemination of information technologies. Transport infrastructure and access to energy are prerequisites for unlocking the potential [SDGs 2, 8 and 9].
In the environmental dimension, Poland strives to improve the state of the environment and sustainable management of resources, ensuring economic development and high quality of life, while guaranteeing development opportunities for future generations. In particular, Polandis objective is to increase the available water resources and to achieve high water quality, sustainable management of natural and geological resources, as well as effective waste management. The measures will also lead to the improvement of air quality, protection of soils against degradation, as well as to the reduction of the impact of noise and electromagnetic fields, which will have a positive impact on the health of the citizens [SDGs 6, 12 and 15].
Another objective for Poland is the socially sensitive and territorially sustainable development, characterised by a high levels of employment, good quality jobs and a large scale of entrepreneurship, with focus on the importance of all areas, including agglomerations, small towns and rural areas, in the development process. The benefits	of	economic	growth	should	be	available	to	all,	regardless	of	their place of residence [SDGs 10 and 11].
Achievement of the above priorities will not be possible without strengthening	the	efficiency	and	effectiveness	of	the	state	and	its	institutions serving growth, as well as social and economic inclusion. Improving the quality of legislation and its application, increasing the effectiveness of functioning of public institutions, strengthening the system of strategic management of development processes, greater use of opportunities offered by technologies in state management and communication with citizens and, above all, overcoming the silo mentality will increase the ability of the state to ensure consistent and effective implementation of complex strategic development goals and increase the level of citizensi trust in the state [SDG 16].
We focus on cooperation, partnership and joint responsibility of public entities, businesses and citizens for the development processes. This	is	reflected	in	a	shift	from	an	administration	system	to shared management and shared responsibility for the success of transformational changes, which requires the involvement of state institutions (constitutional bodies, government, local government), social and economic partners, academic circles, private entities, including entrepreneurs. It is crucial to build social dialogue around the most important projects and broad social support and trust between public entities and their partners in order to achieve development goals. In this context, SDG 17 Partnerships for the Goals both emphasises the principle of implementation of Polandis development priorities and remains an independent objective, the achievement	of	which	determines	progress	in	five	basic	areas:	People,	Planet, Prosperity, Peace and Partnership. Poland recognises that a number of measures taken in the country contribute to the achievement	of	all	5	transformational	changes	defined	in	the	2030	Agenda.

Institutional mechanism of implementation of sustainable development in Poland

In accordance with the new global partnership for sustainable development, Polish government strives to cooperate with its partners on an equal footing in joint initiatives, constantly developing their effectiveness and efficiency. Successful implementation of sustainable development goals is a complex task which requires determined and continuous measures and close cooperation of ministries and local government administration as well as all stakeholders. 
The institutional system for sustainable development in Poland ensures a clear division of competences in the area of strategic planning, operational programming, management and implementation, as well as monitoring and evaluation of the integrated approach. The institutional system enables the social and economic partners to participate in the preparation of integrated strategic papers and includes them in the monitoring and evaluation of development policy at all levels of 
development management.
According to the proposed model of Polandis development management, the following entities participate in strategic coordination:
The Council of Ministers,	led	by	the	Prime	Minister,	defines	the	countryis development objectives and the manner in which they are to be achieved under respective development policies. The Council

of Ministers adopts Polandis development strategy and its updates, and determines the manner in which its objectives are to be achieved, including	the	necessary	financial	outlays.	

The Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers7 coordinates the entire economic policy, while the Social Committee of the Council of Ministers works on key social issues. 
Recognising that such a complex programme as the Sustainable 
Development Goals requires a comprehensive approach, strong cooperation and involvement of representatives of various circles in the process, the abovementioned Task Force for the Coherence of the Strategy for Responsible Development by 2020 (with a perspective to 2030) with the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals was appointed. It is a key body of cooperation between the administration and social and economic partners with regard to building an appropriate mechanism of coordination and implementation of SDGs in Poland. 
Documents resulting from the works of the Task Force are presented at a meeting of the Coordination Committee for Development Policy (CC DP). The CC DP analyses the proposals for strategic documents. It also evaluates the progress and results of the implementation of the strategy.	Apart	from	ministries,	central	offices	and	institutions,	social	dialogue platforms play a special role in the institutional mechanism. The Social Dialogue Council operates at the central level8. This institution is a forum for tripartite dialogue in Poland and cooperation between employees, employers and the government. At the regional level, there are also voivodeship social dialogue councils, where representatives of employees, employers as well as local and central government authorities cooperate. 
An important element of social dialogue are Tripartite Sectoral 
Teams (in which the government, employers and employees are represented), established to conduct sectoral dialogue to reconcile the interests of the parties during the implementation of government action programmes and to solve problems related to the functioning of a given sector/industry. 
The key partners in the process of creating the national development management system at the regional and local level are local governments. They play a key role in managing the development of voivodeships and gminas. This cooperation, based on the principles of subsidiarity and partnership, is supported by a system of territorial contracts and agreements, ensuring cooperation between local governments and the government in programming, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of development policy. 
The voivodeship government initiates, integrates and coordinates the development of the region.9 It is responsible for programming regional development activities, building cooperation networks at the regional level, coordinating pro-development activities implemented in the voivodeship and ensuring the progress of regional policy implementation processes through appropriate monitoring and evaluation mechanisms. The voivodeship government also plays a coordinating role in the measures and investments of supra-local importance planned in the region, including in functional areas. 
The Joint Central Government and Local Government Committee brings together representatives of Polish organisations of local government units. The Committee sets economic and social priorities for the development of gminas, poviats and voivodeships, assesses the legal and	financial	conditions	for	the	operation	of	local	government	units	and issues opinions on draft normative acts, programme documents and solutions concerning the issues of local government (in particular the	expected	financial	effects),	including	those	which	will	result	from	the implementation of the SRD. 
The Public Benefit Works Council is an active partner in cooperation for	the	sustainable	development	policy	in	Poland.	The	Public	Benefit	Works Council institutionalises the principle of civil dialogue and cooperation between the public sector and the so-called third sector. It complements the institutions implementing the principle of social dialogue and is at the level of the Joint Central Government and Local Government Committee and the Social Dialogue Council. It is an opinion-making, advisory and auxiliary body of the Chairman of the Public	Benefit	Committee.	
The Labour Market Council and voivodeship and poviat labour market councils play an important role in the implementation of the principles of sustainable development in the area of employment and labour. The Labour Market Council, as a platform for tripartite social dialogue, has the prerogative to program expenditures of the National Training Fund with regard to lifelong learning in accordance with the	current	needs	of	employers,	e.g.	in	the	field	of	new	technologies,	in work processes that are conducive to effectiveness and with due focus on its environmental dimension.
The institutional mechanism applies an integrated approach to the cooperation of actors, which means that the various measures taken by different actors are concentrated on the strategic objectives. Interventions within individual areas are not isolated but complementary, just as development priorities and SDGs are correlated. This allows for coordination as early as at the programming stage and then the implementation stage in order to create the synergies necessary for the achievement of the assumed goals. 
Taking into account the strategic and horizontal nature of the SDGs and their consistency with the objectives of the SRD, their implementation involves state institutions in accordance with their respective competences and with the principle of subsidiarity, including constitutional bodies, government administration and local authorities, as well as social and economic partners, associations and non-governmental organisations, academia and private entities (in particular businesses). Participation of these entities at all stages of the processes related to programming and implementation of development measures ensures their	effectiveness	and	efficiency.	It	also	leads	to	broad	social	support	and trust between public actors and their partners to achieve development goals. Other factors contributing to the achievement of those goals will include e.g. cooperation programmes for respective government	bodies	with	non-governmental	organisations,	defining	active	forms of dialogue with entities participating in the development policy. 
It	is	also	important	to	precisely	define	the	division	of	tasks	between	the central and local government administration. Therefore, apart from horizontal cooperation, we also provide for vertical cooperation between individual levels of impact: central, regional and local.

Measures towards the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals
Starting position 
The implementation of the 2030 Agenda is a comprehensive, multi-faceted process. The correlations between the 17 SDGs require forward-looking planning to address the needs of present and future generations and new approaches to national strategic management. To plan the best possible directions of measures, it was necessary to define	the	starting	position,	i.e.	to	determine	at	what	stage	of	the	SDG	implementation Poland was, as well as to identify the solid foundations and	bridges	allowing	for	generating	benefits	and	better	results	in	other	areas,	as	well	as	the	systemis	deficiencies	and	low	outlays.	
To verify its starting position, Poland used e.g. studies prepared by international organisations, including the OECD14, as well as national analyses. As part of international comparisons, the OECD analysed Polandis position in relation to the OECD average in relation to the Sustainable Development Goals. The evaluation results from an analysis of internationally comparable indicators available in the OECD and UN databases. 
According to the analysis, Poland has made impressive progress in raising the living standards of its citizens in recent decades, with GDP per capita rising from 37.6% of the OECD average in 1990 to 65.4% in	2016.	Significant	social	achievements	accompanied	this	economic	progress. Overall poverty rate is close to the OECD average. Labour force participation has improved, although it is relatively low compared to the average, in particular among older workers. The performance of the school system has been improving, as evidenced by Polandis rising scores in the OECDis Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), but additional efforts are needed to improve the performance of the lifelong learning and vocational education. This would foster innovation and speed up productivity growth. Energy efficiency	improvements	in	industry	and	structural	changes	in	the	economy have enabled Poland to meet its commitments under the Kyoto	Protocol.	The	country	ratified	the	Paris	Agreement	and	is	on	track to respect its 2020 target of limiting the rise in greenhouse gas (GHG)	emissions	outside	the	EU	emissions	trading	system.	Significant	changes will be needed to the power and transport sectors to further reduce emissions in the long term. Water quality remains an issue in Poland. Meeting the SDGs will also require additional efforts to conserve the Baltic Sea and better protect the countryis forests.

In order to thoroughly verify the progress Poland is making in the transformation towards sustainable development, at the end of 2016 an expert report was prepared entitled Polandis position in the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals adopted with the UN 2030 Agenda. 
The analysis was based on the results obtained by Poland in international summaries of indicators - indices deemed adequate for the implementation of the Goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda:
\0xEF SDG Index - an index developed by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) and Bertelsmann Stiftung (covering 149 countries);
\0xEF Human Development Index (including the Gender Development Index and the Gender Inequality Index) developed by the United Nations Development Programme - Human Development Indicators - including gender - (covers 188 countries);
\0xEF Social Progress Index - human development indicators developed by Social Progress Imperative (covering 133 countries);
\0xEF Global Competitiveness Index - World Economic Forum (covers 
140 countries);
\0xEF Environmental Performance Index (Yale Centre for Environmental 
Law & Policy, Yale Data-Driven Environmental Solutions Group, 
Yale University, Centre for International Earth Science Information Network, Columbia University) (covers 180 countries).
 
As each of the analysed indices takes into account different sets of indicators, for the purposes of determining the base level for respective	SDGs,	the	most	appropriate	indicators	for	the	specific	nature	of	Poland have been selected. 
The analysis showed that Polandis current SDG performance is mostly average, i.e. better than that of the 25% of the weakest countries, but worse than that of the 25% of the best countries in international rankings. As many as 8 out of the 17 Goals achieved results equal to 2.5 or 3 in the 3-degree scale adopted as part of the national analysis, which means that in many of the analysed indicators Poland is also among the countries with the highest results.
The evaluation of the results of the abovementioned expert opinion 17, and SDGs 12 and 15. Therefore, in part of the objectives, this took into account the data constraints and, for certain SDGs, the evaluation	referred	to	the	achievement	of	specific	targets	within	the	small number of indicators, in particular with regard to SDGs 13 and SDG rather than to the overall goal. 
Figure 3.	Polandis performance in the achievement of SDGs based on the abovementioned   	 	international statements of indicators on the 3-degree scale

Source: Own study.
The analysis assessed the convergence of the SRD priority areas with the goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda and showed that the areas with the greatest coherence with the 2030 Agenda were: education,	participation,	social	inclusion,	GDP	growth,	financial	services,	infrastructure, research and development, economic innovation, entrepreneurship (including small and medium-sized enterprises), employment, sustainable agriculture, industry, adaptation to climate change, and pollution.
Coherence	deficits	(or	where	the	SRD	does	not	refer	to	areas,	or	measures are included in separate programmes) are noticed in the following areas: development cooperation, global cooperation for sustainable development and management of marine ecosystems.
The results of analyses concerning the implementation of SDGs to date, carried out on the basis of various sources and supplemented by the mapping of measures taken by respective ministries, allowed for a reliable and responsible evaluation of Polandis progress in the achievement	of	each	SDG,	as	well	as	for	identification	of	gaps	and	determination of the directions for further actions.
We are aware that the 17 Goals of the 2030 Agenda are interlinked and correlated. Efforts to achieve respective SDGs entail progress or weakness in others. Given this nature of the SDGs, an important factor of their achievement is consistency between the policies pursued in various areas. This is particularly important in constructing instruments and tools to bridge or eliminate gaps. 
In accordance with the Polish governmentis new approach to economic management, development priorities are implemented through a	project-based	approach.	The	SRD	identifies	nearly	170	strategic	projects	with	a	defined	responsibility	of	the	project	owner,	resources	and implementation budget. This provides for clear coordination mechanisms, effectiveness and accountability for the success of the adopted	plans.	Only	through	actual	projects	focused	on	specific	effects	is it possible to effectively implement the SDGs. However, achieving the SDGs will be a multiannual process requiring regular adaptation of strategies, action plans and tools to the changing circumstances and the involvement of all stakeholders.



Measures
 
The works of the Polish government aim to create a stable policy to support poor and socially vulnerable people. The Family 500 plus programme	had	a	significant	impact	on	poverty	reduction	in	2016	by	increasing	the	per	capita	income	level	among	the	least	affluent	1/10	of the population by about 40%.10
The poverty level was also reduced by increasing the amounts of family	benefits	and	introducing	the	principle	of	\0xD1PLN	per	PLN	(with	which	the	family	will	not	lose	the	right	to	benefits	completely	when	the	income	threshold	is	exceeded),	introducing	parental	benefits	and	raising	the	income	thresholds	entitling	to	social	assistance	benefits	(in 2012 and 2015). In addition, from 2017, the tax-free amount depends on the taxpayeris income. Every year, the minimum wage also increases (in 2016-18 it grew by 13.5%).
In addition to the abovementioned social policy instruments, many programmes and projects are implemented aimed at key areas related to poverty reduction in Poland. In order to solve the problem of homelessness, the Ministry of Family, Labour and Social Policy co-finances	projects	of	organisations	operating	in	the	field	of	helping	the homeless on an annual basis. 
The improvement of the situation of dependent persons (children, elderly and disabled persons and their families) is implemented within the framework of policies and programmes addressed to these groups of persons. Support is being provided for older people to improve their quality of life and standard of living. In 2018, the implementation of the Care 75+ programme began, aimed at increasing the accessibility of care services and specialist services for single and elderly people aged 75+, who live in small gminas with a population of up to 40,000. Active senior policy (the Multiannual Senior+ 
Programme 2015-2020 and the Governmental Programme for Social Activity of Older Persons 2014-2020 (ASOS)) focuses e.g. on the development of a network of daycare homes and clubs for the elderly and the development of their social activity. The Friendly Poland - Accessibility Plus Programme, on the other hand, aims to improve the quality and independence of life of all citizens, including in particular the elderly and people with permanent or temporary limitations to mobility and perception. This is to be achieved by improving the accessibility of public areas, products and services in terms of architecture, information and communication. A number of measures in the For Life programme provide for the improvement of the situation of heavily burdened families with expenditures on treatment and rehabilitation of disabled people.
The area of social economy is also actively supported within the framework of the implementation of the National Programme for the Development of Social Economy 2014-20 (currently being updated). Social and solidarity economy entities were provided with	access	to	repayable	financial	instruments11 facilitating their independent functioning. The standards of support services for these entities are also being raised due to the continuous development of the accreditation system for Social Economy Support Centres.
In addition, housing policy instruments serve to solve the problem of poverty in Poland. The Apartment+ package, under the National Housing Programme adopted by the government in 2016, includes primarily investment activities that focus on the creation of a new housing reserve: construction of commonly available apartments for lease with moderate rent (with possible target ownership) on market terms, using e.g. public land and support for social rental construction projects.   
Active measures are also taken to counteract social exclusion. Active Forms of Counteracting Social Exclusion - new dimension 2020 supports activities of local government units and non-governmental organisations for active integration of people excluded in the local community, active forms of assistance and increasing competences, entrepreneurship and responsibility in the local community. 
In turn, an important element of pro-family policy aimed at reducing the problem of poverty is the increase in the supply of services for families with children, including strengthening the role of family assistants, development of daycare facilities and supporting families, and acceleration of the process of deinstitutionalisation in the area of foster care. 
Drug related expenditure is often one of the largest items in the household budget for the elderly. Therefore, the state budget took over	a	part	of	the	financial	burden	related	to	the	purchase	of	medicines, providing seniors with the opportunity to acquire some of them free of charge. These measures are aimed at providing persons over 75 years of age with free (up to the limit) drugs, foodstuffs for special nutritional purposes and medical devices, included in the list published by the Minister of Health by way of a notice. In particular, the list includes medicines, foodstuffs for particular nutritional uses and medical devices covered by a refund decision relating to the treatment of old-age diseases.

Implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals in Poland
SDG 2 
End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote 

sustainable agriculture
Poland is characterised by a high potential of agricultural production ensuring food self-sufficiency and enabling export production, as evidenced by over 13% share of agri-food products in the structure of Polish exports. A positive phenomenon observed in Polish agriculture is the evolutionary process of rationalisation of agricultural structures, professionalization of agricultural holdings and commercialisation of agricultural production, which allows for an increase in agricultural productivity (an increase in agricultural production at twice the OECD average in 2004-14). 
As a consequence of Polandis membership in the EU, agriculture is covered by the Common Agricultural Policy regulations. EU Common Agricultural Policy instruments play a key role in promoting sustainable food production as well as supporting small farmers. 
Poland is characterised by a significant share in the 
EU agricultural land (8%), the number of agricultural holdings (13%) and the number of people employed in agriculture (19%) in the EU. The share of the employed in the agricultural sector (10.5%) is more than twice the EU and OECD average. At the same time, employment in rural areas is becoming more and more diversified. Since 2004, Poland has seen one of the biggest drops in the number of people working in agriculture in the EU.
The quality of rural infrastructure remains an issue. Despite significant progress in recent years, some rural areas are still lagging behind in terms of infrastructure. Despite the improvement in the effectiveness of the use of agricultural inputs, further measures are also required in the field of fertilisation. Increasing investment in agricultural research and development is key in this regard, but the Agriculture Orientation Index for government expenditures (AOI) is one of the lowest in the EU (0.42).
Poland belongs to the group of countries with the lowest undernutrition rates. On the other hand, problems related to excessive nutrition are increasing. The rates of adult obesity (25.6%) and anaemia in women of reproductive age (25.7%) are higher than the European average and have increased since 2005. Since then, the rates of overweight (25.7%) and obesity (9.1%) for children and adolescents aged 5-19 have also increased.
Priorities
 
State intervention in agriculture focuses on support for structural transformations ensuring the growth of agricultural competitiveness, food quality and safety, as well as national food security, taking into account environmental requirements. Another aim is to create conditions for diversification of economic activity in order to obtain and create alternative sources of income for the inhabitants of rural areas.
The competitiveness of farms and agri-food producers will be enhanced by improving their profitability, integrating the food chain and distributing the added value more equitably throughout the chain based on a principle of partnership. A number of measures will focus on promotion of agricultural sector products (including high quality food), support for foreign expansion, provision of equal conditions of competition in the common EU market and elimination of barriers particularly burdensome for Polish exports in accessing non-EU markets.
As a result of the planned measures, the agricultural area structure should improve. It is also assumed that the ratio of average annual net disposable income per person in rural household to urban one will improve. Moreover, further development of infrastructure in rural areas will serve objectives related to the development of the economic base and creation of non-agricultural jobs.
These measures should respect biodiversity by increasing or at least not deteriorating it. 
Promoting healthy lifestyle for both adults and children is also an important priority, with a consequent reduction in the proportion of overweight and obese people. 
Measures
 
The key measure is the implementation of innovative solutions in agriculture and agri-food processing through instruments supporting the high quality food sector. Investments are made to utilise the full production potential of the Polish agri-food sector through e.g. further modernisation of agricultural holdings, development of cooperation between food producers, strengthening the links between agricultural holdings and processing plants, restructuring the small farms, support for the development of local agri-food markets, strengthening the advisory network for farmers and entrepreneurs, support for the Business Environment Institutions in rural areas and small towns. The proper functioning of agri-food markets is supported e.g. by the Integrated Agricultural Market Information System. A number of activities focus on the promotion of agri-food sector products and support for foreign expansion in this area, including by ensuring the equal conditions of competition in the common market. Measures in the area of promotion of sustainable management methods are continued e.g. within the framework of the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020.
The development or modernisation of infrastructure necessary to conduct business activity in rural areas also remains important, including modernisation of transport infrastructure and investments related to the water and sewage network. This is related to the proper management	of	local	water	resources,	the	prevention	of	floods	and	droughts	and the minimisation of the negative effects of natural phenomena. 
The 2018 National Report
The area of interest includes activities related to water management in agriculture (land melioration, increase in water retention) and protection of productivity of forest and agricultural land. The use of ICT (information and communication technologies) is promoted in the modernisation processes of the agricultural sector and for the improvement of the quality of life in rural areas. Increasing the availability of broadband Internet will have an impact on counteracting the digital exclusion in rural areas.
Public aid is continued in the area of food assistance, including under the Food Aid Operational Programme 2014-2020, under which approximately 1.3 million people in need receive aid in the form of food packages or meals each year. Promoting a healthy diet among pupils by making fruit, vegetables, milk and dairy products available to children, as well as educational measures carried out in schools, is the subject of the Programme for Schools. Moreover, under the National Health Programme 2016-2020 a number of measures are implemented, including those promoting appropriate eating habits and	physical	activity	for	the	benefit	of	maintaining	proper	body	weight,	carrying out comprehensive epidemiological studies on the diet and nutritional status of the Polish society etc.
The protection of crop and livestock genetic diversity is implemented through the instruments of the Common Agricultural Policy and through national measures - preservation of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture in gene banks and maintenance of local breeds of farm animals at risk of extinction. Actions to promote biological progress in animal and plant production shall aim at optimising the genetic base.

Measures
 
The key documents in the area of public health in Poland are the Act on public health from 11 September 2015 (Dz. U. [Journal of Laws] 2017 item 2237, as amended) and the National Health Programme for 2016-20 (NHP). The programme sets out priority directions for action in 6 areas: 
1. improvement of diet, nutritional status and physical activity in the population; 
2. preventing and solving problems related to the use of psychoactive substances, behavioural addictions and other risky behaviours;
3. prevention of mental health problems and the improvement of mental well-being;
4. reduction of health risks arising from physical, chemical and biological hazards in the outdoor environment, workplace, home, recreation and study areas; 
5. promotion of healthy and active ageing; 6. 	improvement of reproductive health of the society.
 
The following health policy programmes complement the activities implemented under the NHP.
One of the elements limiting the number of complications and consequences of neonatal developmental defects is the Programme of comprehensive diagnostics and intrauterine therapy in the prevention of the consequences and complications of fetal developmental defects and diseases - as an element of improving the health condition of foetuses and newborns 2014-17. In addition, the Polish newborn screening programme is implemented to reduce newborn, infant and child mortality from congenital metabolic abnormalities and to prevent severe and permanent physical and intellectual impairment resulting from these abnormalities. In terms of improving the reproductive health of the population, the Comprehensive programme for the protection of reproductive health in Poland has been implemented, aimed at increasing	the	availability	of	high	quality	services	in	the	field	of	fertility	diagnostics and treatment. Since 2016, Poland has introduced a health service called Coordinated care for pregnant women.

On the other hand, within the framework of the National Programme for Combating Cancer Diseases, activities related to the promotion of cancer prevention, screening, purchase of equipment for cancer diagnostics and treatment and educational activities are carried out. In January 2015, the so-called oncological package was launched in Poland, the aim of which was to shorten the period from the suspicion of cancer to the commencement of treatment, to guarantee the complexity	of	this	treatment,	as	well	as	unlimited	financing	of	diagnostics	and oncological treatment.
The policy of the state towards the HIV and AIDS epidemics has been defined	in	the	law	and	in	the	National Programme for Preventing HIV Infections and Combating AIDS, under which the programme 
Antiretroviral treatment of people living with HIV in Poland 2017-21 is implemented. 
Poland also has a system of widespread preventive vaccination, effectively preventing the spread of dangerous infectious diseases.
As regards prevention of mental health problems and improvement of mental well-being, the Programme for prevention of depression in Poland 2016-20 and the National Programme for Mental Health Protection 2017-22 are carried out in Poland. 
On the other hand, the subject of addictions - prevention and solving problems related to the use of psychoactive substances, behavioural addictions - is included in the National Programme for Counteracting Drug Addiction and the National programme for prevention and resolution of alcohol problems. 
In order to reduce the mortality and post-traumatic disability of injured persons in accidents, injury centres for adults have been established in Poland, where traumatic patients, including accident victims, are treated. It is planned to create injury centres for children. 
In the area of chemicals management, Poland undertakes, within the framework of cooperation with the European Union and OECD countries, actions to eliminate substances posing a threat to human health, including workers using chemicals and consumers, as well as to the environment from the market. Such substances shall be subject to procedures for restricting or prohibiting their manufacture, use or placing on the market. A group of substances considered to be dangerous for human health and the environment shall be subject to identification	procedures	and	to	progressive	substitution	by	suitable	safer alternatives. At the national level, there has been a system in place for several years to collect information (on physicochemical, toxicological and ecotoxicological properties) on hazardous mixtures placed on the national market.
In	the	field	of	telemedicine	and	telecare,	a	number	of	recent	legislative changes have been introduced which have removed barriers to the development of telemedicine, such as the requirement for the patient to be personally examined by a doctor has been abolished, the possibility of determining his state of health also by ICT systems has been introduced, the provisions enabling a doctor, a dentist, a nurse and a midwife to practise the profession and the provisions enabling the provision of pharmaceutical services also by means of information and communication systems have been introduced, as regards entities providing exclusively outpatient health services by means of information and communication systems - the obligation to meet technical requirements concerning premises and equipment required from entities providing services under the classic formula (i.e. with the patientis and doctoris personal contacts) has been abolished. At the same	time,	the	possibility	of	defining	requirements	for	\0xD1telemedicine	providers was introduced. The National Health Fund has introduced a new range of health care services to be contracted separately: geriatric teleconsylium, cardiological teleconsylium and hybrid cardiological telerehabilitation.

The 2018 National Report
SDG 4 
Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong 
learning opportunities for all
The right to education is guaranteed in the Constitution of the Republic of Poland. The current educational system is aimed at improving the performance of students at different levels of education and equipping them with the competences necessary for later social and professional life. The results of the education system in Poland in international comparisons are above the OECD average. The statistics also show that men and women have equal access to education.
Poland recorded a significant increase in the rate of attending children in pre-school education (from about 58% in 2006 to almost 81% in 2016), although there are significant urban-rural disparities. Since September 2017, every child aged 3-6 has been provided with a place of pre-school education, and in 2018, numerous facilities for running cr\0xCBches and childrenis clubs came into force. In some municipalities it is also possible to subsidise childcare at home as a public service. The tertiary attainment rate exceeded the EU average and in 2016 amounted to 44.6% of the population aged 30-34. On the other hand, adult participation in lifelong learning amounts to 3.7% of the population aged 25-64 and is significantly lower than the EU average (10.8%). 
Priorities
 
The challenge of the Polish education system is the quality and attractiveness of vocational education, for which the demand will grow. It is also crucial to further improve the quality of the higher education system and to improve the labour market relevance of vocational education and training. It is necessary to develop such skills as: creativity, problem solving, teamwork, preparation for lifelong learning. It is equally important to create conditions for the development of education throughout the country and for equalisation of educational opportunities, as well as to create conditions for greater involvement of adults in raising / updating qualifications. 
The challenge remains to improve the innovativeness of education, which we strive to achieve e.g. through changes in the curricula, taking into account the emphasis on universal and digital competences, knowledge of foreign languages, creativity, initiative, entrepreneurship, innovation, teamwork skills and support for students with special educational needs. 
The key direction of measures is adjusting vocational education to the needs of modern economy, e.g. through promotion of cooperation of schools and local governments with employers, stronger emphasis on developing practical skills, modernisation of education offer and content, vocational training and counselling, monitoring the labour market in terms of demand for occupations, vocational counselling, improving the competence and qualifications of vocational teachers. On the other hand, the target system of higher education should guarantee its effective cooperation with the economic, social and cultural environment of universities, based on more autonomous and non-bureaucratic rules. It will be crucial to match higher education with the needs of the modern economy, including greater involvement of practitioners in the educational process.
Measures
 
Since the beginning of 2017, an education reform has been introduced with the main objective of better preparing students completing the entire cycle of education for the needs of individual development and the modern labour market. The changes cover all components: education reform, higher education reform, vocational and lifelong learning reform. 
In connection with the change in the structure of education, a new core curriculum has been implemented since the school year 2017/2018, which takes into account the opinions expressed by social organisations in the course of consultations. Social, civic, environmental and cultural education issues are guaranteed a permanent place in the new document, as are the development of social competences based on the principles of solidarity, democracy, tolerance, justice and freedom, and respect for European and world cultures. Under the Strategy, a number of directions of activities to be implemented by 2030 have been planned, which will include in particular shaping pro-social attitudes, including by creating conditions for volunteers, associations and other organisations to operate at school. Also, steps are taken to improve the skills of adults and their participation in education e.g. by strengthening educational and professional counselling,	developing	a	flexible	offer	of	institutions	operating	in	the	local	community, promoting other forms of adult learning, developing soft skills through practical activities within non-formal education, continuous monitoring of the skills of adults, including participation in	international	surveys	in	this	field.	
In September 2017, a draft Act on higher education and science, the so-called Constitution for Science, was presented. It provides for a	fundamental	change	in	the	organisation,	functioning	and	financing	of higher education and research systems, as well as in the quality assessment and management of the education process and the development	of	academic	and	scientific	careers.	As	part	of	the	reform,	a new model of education will be introduced, aimed at better matching the competences of students and doctoral students with the needs of the labour market. In order to strengthen the cooperation of higher education institutions with the social and economic environment in the development and implementation of study programmes, the draft Act	provides	for	two	educational	paths	in	fields	of	practical	study,	i.e.	compulsory six-month apprenticeship or training in the form of dual studies. The bill also includes projects aimed at the implementation of the idea of sustainable development of higher education, aimed at supporting regional universities: the Regional Initiative of Excellence, the Teaching Initiative of Excellence. The draft law was adopted by the Council of Ministers on 20 March 2018.
Moreover, under the Operational Programme Knowledge Education 
Development, projects are implemented which strengthen the practical dimension of education and the development of social competences, i.e. Integrated School Curricula, Vocational Training Programme at the State Higher Vocational Schools, Do you study? Practice! As part of the higher education reform, projects are also being implemented to strengthen the third mission of universities, i.e. the creation by universities of innovative forms of social and educational activation of the regionis inhabitants, and the initiation by universities of training programmes for people in different age groups.12
It	is	also	important	to	disseminate	subject-based	systems	for	financing	development	services.	They	will	allow	for	simple	and	quick	financing	of advisory or training services selected by the entrepreneur and for repayable specialist training/courses for employees. It is also important to internationalise and open Polish universities to innovation. On 1 October 2017, the National Academic Exchange Agency was established, whose main tasks include initiating and implementing activities supporting international academic exchange and the process of internationalisation of Polish universities and research units, as well as dissemination of information about the Polish system of higher education and science. Legislative and programming solutions were also introduced to foster innovation and commercialisation of research results (under the Act of 21 April 2017 amending the Act on academic degrees and academic title and on degrees and title in art and certain other acts (Dz. U. [Journal of Laws] from 2017 item 859), the Industrial doctorate programme was launched to provide training for participants in doctoral programmes in cooperation with entrepreneurs who employ them and to guarantee scholarships). Measures aimed at ensuring the quality of training offer are also important, in particular through the implementation of the Integrated Qualifications	System.
An important direction of activities will also be dissemination of ICT solutions in education and support for management and human resources development at universities. 
Since December 2017, the Act on the National Educational Network has been implemented (Dz. U. [Journal of Laws] from 2017 item 2184), aimed primarily at equalising educational opportunities of children by providing them not only with broadband Internet, but also with digital educational resources. As part of the reform of vocational education, a two-tier industry school is being introduced, which will ensure the full permeability of vocational education, giving students both	vocational	qualifications	at	two	levels	and	the	opportunity	to	take	the maturity exam and proceed to the university. The implementation of foreign internships in enterprises/companies/service providers and vocational education or training centres (supported with funds from	the	Erasmus+	programme	and	projects	co-financed	by	the	ESF	under the OP KED (Knowledge Education Development Operational Programme) is also an important direction of the initiated measures.

Measures
 
Most of the measures planned until 2020 will aim to further develop the diversity of childcare provision by increasing the availability and quality of care and early childhood education services, so as to ensure that women can return to the labour market. 
Within the framework of changes on the labour market, a number of measures aimed at economic activation of economically inactive persons and the long-term unemployed, including women, are envisaged. It is planned to support the economic activity of women e.g. through appropriately	targeted	programmes	of	financed	family	support,	development of various forms of childcare, and a programme for improving the	qualifications	of	employees	after	a	break	from	employment.
On 1 September 2017, the right of 3-year-olds to pre-school education has come into force. Support for the development of forms of care for	the	youngest	is	provided	through	co-financing	of	units	providing	places for childcare within the framework of the Ministryis TODDLER programme for the development of institutions for care of children aged up to 3 (from 2017 TODDLER+). Between 2010 and 2017, the number of all childcare facilities up to 3 years of age increased more than eightfold (from 511 to 4.3 thousand), the number of childcare places in these facilities more than threefold (from 32.5 thousand to 110.7 thousand). In addition, the state budget paid contributions from the base, not exceeding the minimum salary, for 8,500 nannies in 2017. Since 2018, it has been decided to allocate the amount of up to PLN 500 million annually (i.e. 350 million more than in 2017) to subsidise and establish institutions for the youngest children under the TODDLER+ programme. PLN 450 million was allocated for the 2018 edition, due to which it is estimated that approximately 24.5 thousand new care places will be created and about 56 thousand will receive	co-financing	for	their	functioning.
The following legislative changes are also important: the amendment of the Labour Code from 26 June 1974 (Dz. U. [Journal of Laws] from 2018 item 917) rendering the rules of taking paternity, maternity and parental	leave	more	flexible,	e.g.	by	increasing	the	number	of	cases	where an employee - the father of a child or an employee - another closest family member can take over part of the maternity and parental leave; introducing the possibility of taking paternity leave in parts; proportionally extending the parental leave where it is combined with part-time work; increasing the age of the child for whom paternity leave can be taken (up to 24 months); raising the age of the child for whom parental leave can be taken (until the end of the calendar year in which the child reaches 6 years of age) and amending the law on the employment of temporary workers from 9 of July 2003 (Dz. U. [Journal of Laws] from 2018 item 594), introducing e.g. increased protection for pregnant workers who perform agency work.
By	2030,	it	is	also	planned	to	promote	flexibility	in	work	arrangements,	including	part-time	work,	teleworking	and	flexible	working	arrangements, which are particularly important for active family-friendly policies and to ensure the conditions for the return of women to the labour market after a break due to childbirth and childcare.
In order to ensure equal opportunities on the labour market by eliminating wage differences, a computer application Equal pay was prepared, which allows to estimate the differences in wages of employees, taking into account their gender, age, education and other characteristics. Actions are also being taken to disseminate knowledge of both the new tool for measuring the wage gap and the issue of wage inequality to a wide audience. 
Balancing the division of domestic responsibilities and reconciling professional, private and family life is also actively promoted. The main tool is the portal www.rodzinaipraca.gov.pl prepared as part of the project Family and work - it pays off! It presents and promotes tools and mechanisms supporting reconciliation of professional and family life.
Elimination of gender-based discrimination in all areas of social life is a task carried out within the framework of the governmentis National Action Programme for Equal Treatment.	The	first	edition	of the programme was implemented in 2013-16 and the work on the draft programme for the following years is currently underway. 
Family policy and childcare - comprehensive and systemic support for families with children - provision of institutional care for young children, enabling professional activation of parents and guardians, as well as a programme for increasing the number of places of pre-school education and improving the quality of pre-school education.

Measures
 
PPoland implements the provisions of the EU Water Framework Directive n Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2000 establishing a framework for Community	action	in	the	field	of	water	policy	(Official	Journal	of	the	
European Union 327, 22.12.2000, pp. 1, as amended) through the implementation of measures aimed at the improvement of the status or	potential	of	water	bodies	specified	in	the	developed	planning	documents (river basin management plans, National water and environmental programme, National municipal wastewater treatment programme). In addition, in accordance with the provisions of the Floods Directive n Directive 2007/60/EC on the assessment and management	of	flood	risks	(Official	Journal	of	the	European	Union	L	288,	06.11.2007,	pp.	27),	actions	to	reduce	flood	risks	are	planned	and implemented through the parallel implementation of a number of actions, spatial planning	changes	and	the	restoration	of	field	retention.
It	is	important	to	create	and	develop	a	unified	water	management	structure in the catchment area. Therefore, the newly established State Water Farm Polish Waters (\0xECWody Polskie) will carry out tasks in	the	field	of	flood	safety	and	support	the	municipalities	in	ensuring	access to water for the needs of the population and the economy.
A number of measures are envisaged, the implementation of which will be of a continuous nature, such as pro-ecological management of local water resources, including also landscaping conducive to water retention. Measures aimed at the development of flood protection infrastructure will be continued, based on investments with a high degree of effectiveness and economic viability, as well as appropriate spatial planning, including the construction of small and large retention reservoirs. Additionally, information and education activities will be

carried out in the scope of dissemination of environmentally friendly ways of storing and using fertilizers, including activities aimed at rational fertilizer management.
In addition, further works are being carried out related to the construction and modernisation of the sewage treatment plants, e.g. with the use of EU structural funds. The priority programme Investments in wastewater management outside Poland, in the Bug River catchment area is being implemented. 
Actions will be implemented to develop a national programme of surface water renaturalisation, which is an action aimed at identifying the threats and causes of hydromorphological changes in watercourses and at planning remedial actions that will enable the achievement of environmental objectives for these watercourses.
It is also worth mentioning the measures implemented under the Rural 
Development Programme 2014-2020 favouring the creation of water retaining landscapes, imposing the obligation not to transform permanent grassland and to preserve natural habitats dependent on water.
The implementation of the project Protection of habitats and species of non-forest areas dependent on water is of great importance. The main objective of the project is to implement active protection measures within selected natural habitats and speciesi habitats, aimed at achieving a measurable environmental effect at the national level, i.e. improvement of their conservation status and dissemination of knowledge about the principles and protection requirements of selected natural habitats and species.

Measures
 
The Polish government is of the opinion that the energy transformation must ensure that citizens have access to certain energy supplies at acceptable prices. 
The main instrument to reduce CO2 emissions will be the replacement of power generation units, whose emissions exceed the standards and whose	average	annual	efficiency	is	less	than	35%,	with	new,	highly	efficient	units	based	on	domestic	energy	resources	(such	as	the	new	Kozienice	power	plant	unit	with	an	efficiency	of	46%	commissioned	in 2017). In 2018, another reporting document entitled National Action Plan for energy efficiency was adopted, containing information on	progress	towards	the	national	energy	efficiency	target	for	2017,	which	also	contains	an	updated	description	of	energy	efficiency	improvement measures. It sets out concrete actions to improve energy efficiency	in	specific	sectors	of	the	economy,	including	measures	to	achieve	the	overall	energy	efficiency	target	of	achieving	a	20%	saving	in the consumption of so-called primary energy in the EU by 2020. The development of innovations in the energy sector will focus on solutions contributing to improving the balance of electricity supply and demand, reducing dependence on external fuel supplies, using waste from the sector and for the energy sector for economic reasons.
Poland is developing smart grids and smart metering to maximise the use of the available energy. Legislative changes are being introduced to facilitate the modernisation and expansion of energy networks. The Minister of Energy appointed the Team for reducing energy poverty in Poland by virtue of the Order of 26 June 2017 (Dz. Urz. ME	[Official	Journal	of	the	Minister	of	Energy]	item	7)	in	order	to	prepare the assumptions and implement the policy in the scope of counteracting the occurrence of energy poverty.

Implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals in Poland
SDG 8 
Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent 

work for all
Polish economy remains one of the leaders of economic growth among the EU countries. It is characterised by a large scale of entrepreneurship, illustrated e.g. by a higher than average share of microenterprises in the group of economic entities in the EU. The share of the entire SME sector in generating value added is still lower than the EU average (54.3% as compared to 56.8% in 2016). However, Poland is one of the EU countries where medium-sized enterprises achieved better results than the EU average in 2016, both in terms of added value and employment. The number of micro- and small companies is dynamically growing, as well as the number of newly registered entities. Challenges for Polish SMEs remain low level of internationalisation and insufficient development of innovation, low level of survival of small companies, as well as relatively weak ability to networking and cooperation.
The policy of supporting entrepreneurship is one of the priorities of the Polish government. The challenge is to effectively stimulate the development activity of companies, in particular innovative ones, which is necessary for positive structural changes in the economy and increasing its productivity. An important aspect of pro-development activities is the removal of existing barriers, including regulatory and financial ones. Much has been achieved in recent years, e.g. in improving access to finance for SMEs. It is worth pointing out that in terms of the size of government guarantees for loans to SMEs (0.8% of GDP in 2016), Poland is among the leading OECD countries.
The situation on the labour market has improved significantly and is showing positive trends. The number of employed persons is growing, and the employment rate in the 15-64 age group has significantly increased over the decade, reaching 66.5% in Q3 2017 (68.2% in the EU). Thanks to a drop in the number of unemployed people over the course of the year by more than a quarter of a million, the registered unemployment rate reached a low level of 6.6% at the end of 2017. In the under-25 age group, the share of the unemployed in the total number of registered unemployed decreased from 18.6% at the end of 2013 to 12.4% at the end of 2017 (in 2014, the Youth Guarantee programme was launched22). 
258 thousand women were covered in 2017 by active forms of support on the labour market, i.e. 53% of the total number of the unemployed using activation instruments. 
Priorities
 
At the current stage of development, Poland seeks new competitive advantages based on the technological advancement of its products, the quality and innovativeness of its products, as well as mechanisms for internationalisation of enterprises. 
The priority is also the development of entrepreneurship through the introduction of legal facilities related to running a business, including access to financing instruments for the development of a company adapted to its size. 
Increasing the employment rate, promoting stable forms of employment and, at the same time, flexible work organisation and delivery methods, remain crucial. An important element is the proper creation of the labour market in order to ensure decent work for all. 
Economic activation of young people, women, people aged 
50+, the long-term unemployed, as well as people with disabilities is the overriding objective at the junction of economic and social policy. It is also important to improve the flow of unused labour from agriculture to other sectors e.g. by facilitating the acquisition of professional skills and qualifications (in particular by people from small and medium-sized agricultural holdings) and making it possible to combine work and agricultural activity. Active labour market instruments are being designed, cooperation with employers is being improved and barriers to taking up employment are being eliminated. In connection with the growing international economic migration, we also recognise the need to develop a responsible migration policy.

Measures
 
For years, the government has been making many efforts to improve the conditions for business and investment in Poland. In order to improve the legal and institutional environment for business, the largest reform of the economic law since 1989 was prepared, consisting of two packages: 100 changes for companies and Constitution for Business. 
The key impulse for supporting economic development is the creation of the Polish Development Fund, which provides greater opportunities to	obtain	additional	funds	from	the	financial	markets,	both	domestic	and foreign, for the purpose of implementing development investments. General availability of guarantees supporting the development of enterprises was ensured by the establishment of the National Guarantee Fund. 
Corporate Income Tax (CIT) was reduced to 15% for small taxpayers and	for	taxpayers	starting	their	operations	in	the	first	tax	year,	due	to which the smallest business entities gained the possibility of accumulating additional capital for future investment and development activities. 
A number of measures are aimed at supporting start-ups and involving large enterprises in the development of technology companies. The Start in Poland programme was launched and a new system of supporting innovative ideas at the junction of the science and business sectors was prepared, among others through R&D tax reliefs.
At the same time, it is planned to introduce a new mechanism of supporting entrepreneurs in undertaking new investments in the territory	of	Poland	(Special	Economic	Zones	-	Poland).	The	planned	support concerns the exemption from income tax (CIT or PIT) and free information services provided by entities responsible for supporting new investments. It is expected that the new solutions will contribute to an increase in investments made by SMEs, and the introduction of quality criteria is aimed at covering investments with a higher added value with support. Further support for the internationalisation of the economy is planned, e.g. through increasing the participation of Polish companies in contracts for international organisations.
In	2016,	the	Codification	Commission	of	Labour	Law	was	established,	composed of representatives indicated by the minister competent for labour, representatives of social partners, members of the Social Dialogue Council, as well as representatives of science and experts. Its purpose was to prepare two draft acts: the Labour Code with justification	and	the	Collective	Labour	Code	with	justification.	In	2018, the Commission completed its works. Draft Labour Code and Collective Labour Code, developed by the Commission, were submitted to the Minister of Family, Labour and Social Policy. Proposals for legal solutions included in both draft acts will be used in legislative works conducted in the Ministry of Family, Labour and Social Policy. On the basis of the selected proposals, draft legislation will be presented which will gradually amend the labour law provisions. These will primarily be proposals relating to working time.
In line with the principle of ensuring decent work for all, steps have been taken to equalise labour costs between civil law contracts and work provided under the Labour Code. A statutory guarantee of a	minimum	amount	of	remuneration	for	specific	civil	law	contracts	in	the form of a minimum hourly rate has been introduced. Every year, the amount of this rate will be indexed to the extent that it corresponds to the increase of the minimum wage for work.
Every year, the minimum wage is increased, which in 2016-18 grew by 13.5%. The amount of the minimum wage currently constituted in 1Q of 2018 slightly above 45% of the average wage in the national economy. 
In order to prevent employers from using their advantage in the labour market, in September 2016, a statutory obligation was imposed on employers	to	confirm	in	writing	the	terms	of	an	employment	contract	concluded with an employee before the employee is admitted to work, if the employment contract was not concluded in writing. Previously, the	employer	was	obliged	to	confirm	the	contract	in	writing	at	the	latest	on the day of commencement of work, if the contract of employment was not concluded in writing. Failure by the employer to do so is an offence	punishable	by	a	fine.
Appreciating the potential of young people, special activities are directed at activating this group. Youth Guarantees (a Europe-wide initiative) are being implemented to ensure that every person under 25 (in Poland, under 29) is provided with job offers, professional activation or further education within 4 months from graduation or loss of job. The measures taken over the last few years to reduce the excessive use of temporary contracts, in particular those which reduce the differences in employment costs based on employment relationships and non-standard contracts, also contribute to the stabilisation of the labour market, as a result of which we can observe a gradual reduction in the trend of replacing employment contracts with civil-law contracts.
We consider measures aimed at professional activation of women to be	crucial.	Measures	taken	by	regional	(poviat)	labour	offices	include	forms of assistance that also facilitate the return of unemployed women to the labour market. Provision of an adequate number of childcare facilities is essential for the smooth reintegration of women into the labour market after childbirth and for the provision of childcare. Such activities are undertaken within the framework discussed in SDG 5.
An important element of the development of the Polish labour market is to ensure its openness to the most vulnerable groups, i.e. people with disabilities. The Strategy for persons with disabilities 2018-30 and the related National Programme for Employment of Persons with Disabilities are being prepared, which provide e.g. for supplementing or modifying the currently functioning instruments supporting employment and economic activation of persons with disabilities and supporting them in entering and maintaining the labour market or taking up economic activity.

Provisions on employment of foreigners have also been amended, taking into account the need to facilitate access to the Polish labour market. One of the objectives of the changes was also to prevent the occurrence of abuses and to improve the management of economic migrations. 
Poland is also raising its labour market standards through an active international	policy	in	this	area.	Poland	has	ratified	the	2014	Protocol	to the 1930 ILO Convention Concerning Forced or Compulsory Labour from 21 October 2016 (Dz. U. [Journal of Laws] item 1942), which requires e.g. that effective action be taken to prevent, eradicate and protect the use of forced or compulsory labour and that adequate remedies be available to victims of forced or compulsory labour.
It is also worth noting that on 29 May 2017 Polish government adopted the National Action Plan for the Implementation of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights 2017-20. (NAP, the UN 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights were approved by the UN Human Rights Council in 2011). The NAP provides information on corporate social responsibility activities and refers to	strategic	documents	in	this	field.	Placing	this	information	in	the	NAP is connected with the conscious policy of the state supporting enterprises and at the same time emphasising the necessity of their observance of human rights.23

The 2018 National Report
SDG 9 
Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation

The development of innovation remains one of the key challenges of the Polish economy. Polandis gross domestic expenditure on research and development increased from 0.56% of GDP in 2006 to 0.97% of GDP in 2016, but it is still below the EU average. Polish exports are dominated by low-processed goods, and the share of high technology and services sectors is still unsatisfactory. At the same time, positive trends can be observed. The technological process has been accelerated, e.g. with the help of EU funds, the machinery has been renovated, new R&D infrastructure has been created and the competence of personnel implementing innovative projects has increased. Additionally, apart from the absorption of ready technologies, enterprises more and more often strive to develop their own solutions based on the results of their own R&D works and to build a competitive advantage on them. 
The changes that have taken place in Poland in recent years have had a positive impact on the innovativeness of the economy. In the annual Bloomberg rankings, we have been constantly promoted for several years (Bloomberg Innovation 2018 Index to the 21st place). According to the European Innovation Scoreboard 2016, Poland belongs to the group of moderate innovators. Thus, one of the challenges will be to stimulate the Polish economy and encourage entrepreneurs to undertake investments in the area of innovation.
While access to mobile Internet is common in Poland, actual usage of digital technologies is low. According to the OECD data, only 25% of people use the Internet for communication and information retrieval on a daily basis.
For years, Poland has been carrying out activities for the benefit of the network of connections in the communication infrastructure. The technical condition of the national road network (still 18,608 km long in 2010) has significantly improved. Between 2000 and 2015, the percentage of roads in good condition with improved hard surface was increased from 55.1% to almost 64%24. 
Since Polandis accession to the European Union, thanks to the use of funds under the cohesion policy, there has been a significant increase in the length of expressways and motorways in the country 25. According to data from the Statistics Poland and the General Directorate for National Roads and Motorways, in the decade between 
2003 and 2013 the length of motorways increased by 266%, and of expressways by 452%. 
Priorities
 
The long-term objective of economic development is to put Poland firmly on the path of innovation, exit the trap of average income and the backbone of cheap labour. It is crucial to improve the legal and institutional environment stimulating to undertake risky innovative activities. As a consequence, the share of industries and knowledge-intensive services in the structure of the economy will increase. This progress will be measured e.g. by the intensity of GERD and BERD (growth to 
1.7% of GDP and 0.8% of GDP in 2020, respectively). A noticeable effect will be an increase in the technological advancement of products, stimulation of the creation of new technological and organisational solutions, basing competitive advantages on the quality and innovation of products and services.
The support function for the implementation of the above priorities will be to be provided by an extensive transport infrastructure (facilitating cooperation and trade), universal and better used access to telecommunications infrastructure, the Internet and digital technologies, as well as access to data, and the internationalisation of enterprises, in particular SMEs, through the creation of support instruments for Polish exporters and investors.

Measures
 
In order to give new impulses to the development of innovativeness in Poland, the White Paper on Innovation was developed where legislative and organisational solutions aimed at increasing innovativeness of the Polish	economy	were	identified.	They	were	included	in	the	following	acts: Act on Entrepreneurs Law of 6 March 2018 (Dz. U. [Journal of Laws] item 646), acts on innovation: in the Act on amending certain acts specifying the conditions for conducting innovative activities of 4 November 2016 Dz. U. [Journal of Laws] item 1933) and the Act amending certain acts to improve the legal environment of innovative activity of 9 November 2017 (Dz. U. [Journal of Laws] item 2201), and	also	draft	laws:	on	the	Research	Network:	?ukasiewicz	and	Industrial property law. These have introduced and expanded a system of instruments that promote and encourage innovative activities, and have	also	stabilized	the	method	of	financing	the	commercialization	of	research and development results. The changes also concerned R&D allowances and granting the status of a research and development centre for smaller enterprises, as well as increasing the possibilities of	financing	innovative	enterprises	by	venture	capital.	Changing	the	business model and encouraging entrepreneurs to take greater risks when introducing new products is becoming an integral part of innovation policy. This will help to make collective forms of investment in	innovative	and	more	demanding	projects,	largely	co-financed	with	public funds, more attractive.
The Start in Poland programme was launched to support the development of the start-up ecosystem, which brings together the most important instruments for supporting start-ups in Poland and covers all stages of development of young companies. It also supports long-term cooperation between companies of all sizes, the process of sharing knowledge and intellectual property. 
The effectiveness of support for Polish exporters and companies deciding to undertake attempts to expand on foreign markets is increasing. What is important, it is adapted to the needs of Polish exporters.
Considering	that	the	specific	nature	of	industry	(in	particular	industrial processing) is far-reaching mechanisation and automation of manufacturing processes, and as a result the potential for productivity growth in this area is high, Poland relies on a strong industry and necessary structural changes in this area. Industrial policy is based on an ecosystem approach, which creates a strong potential for the transfer and absorption of knowledge and competences. Support is targeted at sectors with permanent comparative advantages or product niches. An additional development impulse will be to meet the requirements of environmental protection, including halting the process of climate change and air protection.
The governmentis activities focus on the implementation of new digital technical, technological and organisational solutions, as well as the development of industries based on digital technologies, capable of creating breakthrough products Industry 4.0. The effect of measures taken in favour of intelligent reindustrialisation will be saturation of industry with high quality services (R&D, design, ICT) in order to increase the share of innovative products.
The development of digital technologies and the creation of conditions for	the	construction	of	broadband	networks	(mobile	and	fixed)	are	particularly important. The measures are targeted primarily at the development and modernisation of ICT and telecommunications infrastructure, in particular in rural areas. Many activities are also focused on the development of the information society and digital competences - including support in the area of education, science, lifelong learning, increasing citizensi access to public sector information, ensuring cyber security related to the protection of information confidentiality,	the	continuity	of	IT	systems,	and	conducting	education	and	information	campaigns	to	disseminate	the	benefits	of	the	use	of	digital technologies. 
In this respect it is crucial to ensure data security, including support for data policy development, the creation of a regulatory framework for new digital services and a regulatory authority.
Given the importance of data, its ownership and use, the concept of 
Industry+ has been developed. Its aim is to strengthen the data-based economy in Poland. Industry+ assumes that non-personal data is a leverage for modern economy and should be free of charge, because the most modern computer technologies cannot exist without free access	to	data	and	free	flow	of	data.
Poland is aware that in order to fully exploit its development potential, it is necessary to develop traditional transport infrastructure in the form of roads, railways and intermodal transport. 
The transport system can create growth impulses in the economy if it is able to meet the challenge of increasing accessibility over time and in the space of transport services, the challenge of reducing transport costs and times, while at the same time successively improving energy efficiency	and	lowering	unit	benchmarks,	as	well	as	the	need	to	develop	multimodality and other user expectations.
Efforts to expand the network of connections in the transport infrastructure have continued. The effect of the measures will be the construction of a multi-branch (railway, road, agglomeration network, inland waterway and maritime transport networks, airports) integrated and complementary transport network. It will e.g. reduce transport unit costs, improve safety, the quality of transport services for goods and passengers, transport accessibility at European, national, regional and local level and reduce pollutant emissions from the sector. The development of transport infrastructure of regional and local character (especially in the area of road and rail transport and to a limited extent of inland waterway transport) will aim at including areas with poor accessibility (including rural, border and peripheral areas) in economic and development processes.

National Railway Programme - a project ensuring connection of voivodeship centres by 2023 with modernised railway lines, up to at least an average speed of running passenger trains of 100 km/h, and implementation of the European Rail Traffic Management System on the most important railway routes.

SDG 10 
Reduce inequality within and among 

countries
GDP generated in Poland in 2016 amounted to PLN 1.86 trillion, which after conversion into EUR, taking into account the purchasing power of currencies, constituted 
5.2% of the GDP of the European Union (compared to 
3.9% in 2006). In 2016, GDP per capita reached PLN 
48.4 thousand, i.e. EUR 11.1 thousand (in current prices). According to the purchasing power parity of currencies, it constituted 19.9 thousand PPS26, i.e. 68% of the EU average. In terms of the level of this indicator, Poland is ranked 22nd in the EU-28 (in 2006 it was the 26th position). At the voivodeship level, the GDP per capita ratio in relation to the EU average in 2015 ranged from 
47% to 109%. In 2007-16, the development gap between Poland and the average level of economic development in the EU decreased significantly, measured by the level of GDP per capita calculated taking into account differences in purchasing power of currencies.
At the same time, Poland belongs to the countries with a moderate level of inter-regional differentiation at the level of voivodships. According to the Statistics Poland 
(GUS), the average voivodship variation in the level of GDP per capita increased from 18.6% in 2006 to 20.8% in 2015. Subregions are characterized by the considerable differentiation. Clear disproportions visible within voivodships result, among others, from strong inequalities between urban and rural areas.
A negative phenomenon, being a result of the process of development polarisation, is the progressive accumulation of social and economic problems in certain areas of the country. These areas, showing peripherality in relation to the strongest growth centres, such as voivodship capitals, or as a result of structural transformations of the economy, record a significant drop in the quality of life and deteriorating investment conditions. 
The group of areas with concentration of development problems includes concentrations of rural gminas and functionally related small and medium-sized cities located mainly in the northern and eastern part of the country. These also include border areas on the EUis external border. They are characterised by peripheral location outside the functional areas of large cities and poor transport accessibility. A significant threat is the further deterioration of the competitive position of these areas and the decrease in their participation in development processes, which may lead to their permanent social and economic marginalisation.
Priorities
 
Bridging the differences in the social and economic development of regions, preventing the creation of new development disparities and challenges related to the development of regions are the subject of regional policy defined in the National Strategy for Regional Development (NSRD). The main objective of the regional policy until 2030 is the effective use of specific endogenous potentials of territories and their development specialisations. This will translate into the achievement of the objectives of the countryis development - creating conditions for an increase in the income of the Polish population, while increasing cohesion in the social, economic and spatial dimension. 
The overall objective will be implemented on the basis of three strategic objectives: effective use of development factors of the regions	(\0xD1competitiveness),	cohesion of the country in the social, economic and spatial dimension and efficient administration for development.
26. 	Purchasing power parities (PPP) are types of currency exchange rates that are used to convert economic indicators expressed in national currencies to a common conventional currency. They eliminate the impact of differences in price levels between countries. GDP per capita UE28 = 100 expressed in Purchasing Power Standards (PPS) shows the GDP of a given country in relation to the EU average, the value of which was assumed as 100. Values lower or higher than 100 indicate on lower or higher GDP than the EU average, respectively.
Measures
 
On the one hand, regional policy will strengthen key factors of competitiveness of regions, mainly in the direction of economic activation, development of regional specialisations, development of local labour markets and professional mobilisation of inhabitants. On the other hand, it will be aimed at preventing the deepening of intra-regional differences and reducing disparities in the development of individual regional territories. Regional development activities in the 2030 perspective will be implemented in an integrated way, combining sectoral interventions with regional and different sources (EU and national) and forms of funding (grants and feedback mechanisms), taking	into	account	supraregional,	regional	and	local	specificities	as	well as functional areas.
The objectives of the regional policy focus on the implementation of measures leading to the development of human and social capital, innovative development of the region and improvement of the approach based on Regional Smart Specialisations, stimulation of investments of enterprises (new and existing) in the areas which are considered important for the economy of the region. Moreover, it is important to strengthen development opportunities of areas threatened by permanent marginalisation, including rural areas and small and medium towns, as well as to strengthen the potential of medium towns losing their social and economic functions. Strengthening cooperation and an integrated approach to development at local, regional and supra-regional level is key in this process. This will be achieved by improving the organisation of public service provision at local level, strengthening the administrative capacity of local and regional authorities and their willingness to cooperate with development partners, as well as by an effective and coherent system of financing	development	policy.
According to the model of sustainable development of the whole country, based on the pro-development potential of the polycentric settlement network, including centres of various size, importance and functions, the regional policy will focus to a greater extent on areas	with	restructuring	difficulties,	medium-sized	cities	losing	their social and economic functions and rural areas with their local urban centres. Appropriate attention will also be paid to large cities (more	specifically	about	the	cities	in	SDG	11).	Functional	links	between the above-mentioned areas are also becoming an extremely important element. 
On the institutional level, it will be important to further strengthen the capacity to plan and carry out development activities (in particular at the local level), to improve the quality of management of the settlement network centres and their functional areas and to gradually develop the management of whole functional areas as well as to create better conditions for the coordination of these activities by the local authorities and to facilitate their cooperation at regional, national and European level. 
With a view to equalising the living standards of communities living in different areas of Poland, it is important to improve access to services, including social and health services. Within this area, solutions are implemented to increase access to cheap housing, changes in the functioning of the private rental market and supported housing for people at risk of social exclusion. Social activities aimed at reducing inequality among children, access to assistance and care services and rehabilitation equipment for persons with disabilities, promotion of professional and social activity of seniors, ensuring accessibility to public space for persons with reduced mobility are implemented.
 Equal access to the labour market ensuring the use of the potential of human resources is also important for the preservation of social equality within the country. In this respect, support instruments are adjusted to individual needs of the local labour market, taking into account human capital reserves available in the region (young people, women, people with disabilities, people aged 50+, the long-term unemployed, including those in sectors with unused labour resources - agriculture, mining, etc.).
Measures aimed at poverty reduction indicated in SDG 1, as well as measures aimed at appropriate creation of the labour market in order to ensure decent work, presented in SDG 8, will also contribute to reducing inequalities in the income dimension.
An appropriate migration policy is important for levelling out all developmental disproportions within the country and in the international context. Measures in this area will aim at creating a comprehensive, multidimensional instrument for human resources management covering e.g. preparing the concept of a responsible immigration policy targeted at the needs of the labour market and Polish entrepreneurs, creating integration paths for selected categories of foreigners, limiting the phenomenon of illegal immigration, development of integration instruments aimed at both foreigners coming to Poland and persons returning to the country. It should be stressed that refugees and persons with subsidiary protection, with the exception of electoral rights, have the same rights as Polish citizens.

Measures
Measures relating to urban policy in Poland are aimed e.g. at creating economically active and citizen-friendly cities. In the activities focused on improving the development conditions of Polish cities, main attention is paid on: 
\0xEF dissemination of the principles of public participation in decision-making and management of cities and their functional areas, including support for revitalisation activities; 
\0xEF implementation of low-carbon urban strategies, reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions;
\0xEF implementation of sustainable urban mobility strategies, the use of public transport or the creation of conditions for the development of electromobility;
\0xEF improvement of access to various types of public services of a development nature; 
\0xEF creation of a national network of cooperation between cities, enabling exchange of knowledge and best practices on sustainable urban development, improvements in management, coordination and implementation of innovative projects. 
Package of measures for medium-sized cities losing their social and economic functions - targets a group of cities with identified problems and hindering the development of areas around them. It is assumed that support will be provided for increasing the attractiveness of these cities for potential investors, improving the quality of human capital and stimulating local economic and social initiatives, as well as supporting local government pro-development investments.
A package of measures to support urban regeneration - aims to promote urban regeneration as an important element of sustainable urban development, through comprehensive actions addressing technical, economic and social issues in parallel. Establishment of a Revitalisation Knowledge Centre disseminating experiences and practices of local governments from revitalisation projects.

The 2018 National Report
It is envisaged that the potential of the largest Polish agglomerations will be fully used e.g. by adopting appropriate legal regulations concerning the metropolitan association. 
Initiatives will be taken to activate cooperation and links between rural areas and cities, and to promote cooperation and partnership instruments in order to involve inhabitants of rural areas in development activities. 
An important direction of measures is to activate the potential of medium-sized cities, which lose their social and economic functions through, among others, support for the development of entrepreneurship, particularly in the sectors which determine the economic specialisation of a given city, stimulation of investment activity in medium-sized cities, creating opportunities for medium sized cities and their municipal companies to take advantage of new solutions in	the	area	of	financing	local	government	investments.	Investment	in urban transport infrastructure - development and integration of public transport systems improving the quality of connections - is also important.

Implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals in Poland


On April 25, 2017, the so-called Clean Air Programme was launched. Additionally, as part of the National Air Protection Programme, actions are taken to minimize, in the shortest possible time, concentrations of particulate matter and other harmful substances in the air. The first measurable measure in this respect was the Ordinance of Minister of Economic 
Development and Finance from 1 August 2017 on the requirements for solid fuel boilers 
(Dz. U. item 1690). Another is the introduction of a requirement to determine the quality of solid fuels and a pilot scheme to finance thermal modernisation and replacement of boilers for the poorest people. It will target 33 towns and cities in the World Health Organisationis ranking of Europeis top 50 polluted cities.

Measures
 
An ambitious plan to improve the situation with regard to waste management was included in the National Waste Management Plan 2022. Waste legislation has been amended to provide for a hierarchy of waste management practices.13 Prevention, subsequent re-use, recycling, other forms of recovery and ultimately disposal were identified as the most important. 
Poland has developed a Roadmap for the transition to circular economy (CLE Map), which aims to move away from linear resource management. It focuses on four main areas of intervention: sustainable production, sustainable consumption, bioeconomy and new business models. Thanks to the involvement of a wide range of stakeholders, it was possible to adapt the project to the specificity of the social and economic situation in Poland. 
Poland is also involved in the Transition from linear to circular: policy and innovation project, which aims to investigate the role of innovative business model solutions and state policy tools supporting these solutions in the transition to a circular economy. The project is based on case studies from a wide range of sectors and countries, the results of which should allow the identification of best practices for business models in a circular economy and the development of a set of recommendations for policy makers. 
Poland also participates in works on the methodology of calculating the environmental footprint of products and organisations. In the future, this methodology may form the basis of the proposed instruments aimed at supporting environmentally friendly products and processes and at phasing out environmentally inefficient products. 
Among the instruments implementing this objective there is also the measure of the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 entitled Organic farming, which contributes to the development of the organic farming system. 
Poland also operates within the European Innovation Partnership on Raw Materials, whose objective is to support innovative solutions in the area of raw material management optimisation.

Implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals in Poland
SDG 13 
Take urgent action to combat climate 
change and its impacts
Poland has been a signatory to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change since 1994 and to the Kyoto Protocol since 2002, thus contributing to the efforts of the international community to reduce climate change. Poland reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 30% in relation to the base year (1988), with a simultaneous increase in GDP of about 220%. This means that the reduction is well above the 6% commitment made in the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. In addition, Poland is taking part in the process of climate negotiations. Among other things, it twice hosted and three times chaired sessions of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC. In December 2018, Poland will host the Conference of the Parties for the third time, this time in Katowice. It should also be noted that Poland was one of the first EU Member States to ratify the Paris Agreement.
EU policy plays a special role in the context of Polish actions aimed at combating climate change. It aims to systematically reduce greenhouse gas emissions by introducing an emissions trading mechanism. For Poland, this is a relatively difficult task due to the high emissivity of the economy, resulting from the dominant role of coal in the production of electricity and heat.
However, Poland has great potential to reduce CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere e.g. by using the potential of forests (30.6 million tons of CO2 absorbed annually by forest land according to the data for 2015) and intensifying the storage of carbon in harvested wood products, mainly due to the development of wooden construction as a storage facility (about 4 million tons of CO2 according to the data for 2015 for all categories of harvested wood products). In Poland, the prospect of reducing emissions through investments in energy efficiency and thermomodernisation is very promising. The transport sector also offers significant scope for reducing emissions, with low-carbon and electric vehicles helping, as well as investments in rail infrastructure and the promotion of rail and intermodal transport, at the expense of road and air transport. The state policy is conducive to the achievement of Polandis objectives and commitments on the international level, especially in the context of the three Rio Conventions, including the Climate Convention.
Priorities
 
As far as climate change is concerned, the priority of the Polish government is to effectively reduce the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. This will be done through the introduction of innovative technologies for the use of available energy sources, including the development of geothermal energy with financial support for the exploration and recognition of thermal water deposits and the possibility of obtaining thermal energy from dry rocks. We also see great potential for appropriate forest management to adapt to climate change.
Measures
 
Efforts to reduce emissions remain key climate change measures. Programmes	relating	to	energy	saving,	improving	the	efficiency	of	energy	production and making greater use of renewable energy sources are essential. Measures in this respect include the programme Support for projects relating to low-carbon and resource-efficient economy aimed at reducing the negative impact of projects on the environment through investment activities, and the programme Improvement of air quality aimed at popularising the production of energy from renewable sources and reducing energy consumption in buildings in order to reduce CO2 emissions.
In the light of the problem of emissions, it is also important to develop policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from non-ETS sectors. In turn, within the framework of the Green Investment Schemes , it is	possible	to	finance	measures	limiting	the	emission	of	greenhouse	gases. The system ensures that the funds obtained are used for purposes related to the broadly understood protection of the climate and the environment. So far, more than 400 have been completed. The Norwegian Financing Mechanism and the EEA Financial Mechanism 
2009-14 implement the PL04 programme Saving energy and promoting renewable energy sources, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution and increase the share of energy from renewable sources in the overall energy consumption balance. Due to the implementation of this Programme, greenhouse gas emissions were reduced. The value of limited or avoided CO2 emissions amounts to approximately 490 thousand tons per year.
Actions to counteract climate change are also implemented under such measures of the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 as Investments in the development of forest areas and improvement in forest viability, Agri-environment-climate measure, Organic farming. Through environmentally friendly practices primarily aimed at protecting soil and water, promotion of organic management methods and soil carbon sequestration, these measures are important instruments of support for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. These actions take form of voluntary commitments.
A detailed description of the measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (in all relevant sectors) is provided in the Seventh Government Report and the Third Biennial Report to the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2017.
Moreover, Poland takes a number of adaptation measures aimed at reducing the vulnerability of society and economy to the effects of climate change. Adaptation to climate change is designed to protect society and the economy from the adverse effects of weather events such	as	storms,	floods	and	flooding,	ice	and	droughts.	Flood	prevention infrastructure is being developed as well as appropriate rainwater management in urban areas. Measures related to proper water management for agriculture will also be continued. The main emphasis will be put on comprehensive solutions, which include irrigation and 
The 2018 National Report
accumulation of water in the landscape, storage of water in the soil, appropriate	agrotechnics,	improvement	in	the	efficiency	of	water	management by arable crops.
These actions are implemented through a number of programmes. Under	the	new	environmental	programme	for	2014-2021	(financed	from the Norwegian and EEA Financial Mechanisms), the following activities will be implemented: concerning e.g. renewable energy, energy	efficiency	and	energy	security,	as	well	as	climate	change	mitigation and adaptation.
Implementation of the national climate change adaptation policy, which includes a set of guiding actions for adaptation by 2020 for sectors and areas sensitive to climate change (SPA 2020), is crucial. The main objective of SPA 2020 is to ensure sustainable development and effective functioning of the economy and society in the context of climate change.
The regional level is emphasised, where within the project Developing plans for adaptation to climate change in cities of over 100,000 inhabitants an assessment is made of the vulnerability and vulnerability to climate change of 44 largest Polish cities and the planning of	adaptation	actions,	adequate	to	the	identified	threats.	
The	development	of	water	infrastructure	(flood	protection	and	drought	adaptation infrastructure) aims to strengthen resilience to the risks of climate change and to enhance the capacity to prevent and respond to natural hazards to which Poland is particularly vulnerable, i.e. floods	and	droughts.	
The project Polish wooden houses - live in harmony with nature aims at promoting the use of wood, which is a coal storehouse, in the construction industry. 
As part of the projects related to the construction, development and reconstruction of hydrotechnical facilities, actions are taken to improve	flood	safety,	reduce	drought	and	water	retention.	Within	the framework of the abovementioned tasks, activities related to the construction of the so-called green infrastructure are also planned. In	addition,	flood	risk	management	plans	will	be	implemented	and	flood	risk	management	plans	will	be	updated,	and	a	drought	plan	will	be developed and implemented.
Under	the	official	development	assistance,	Poland	supports	developing	countries in the implementation of SDG 13. All measures of Polish development assistance take into account the impact on the natural environment and climate. In selected African countries - Ethiopia, 
Kenya, Senegal and Tanzania - projects under the thematic priority 
Environment are being implemented on issues such as increasing access to renewable energy sources or building resilience and capacity to cope with the effects of natural disasters, including those caused by climate change.

SDG 14 
Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for 
sustainable development
Poland is a party to the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Baltic Sea Area done in Helsinki on 3 April 1992, (Dz. U. [Journal of Laws] from 2000 item 346), which aims to solve the problem of pollution from land-based sources, ships, waste discharged into the marine environment, as well as to conduct research activities. The main threats to the biodiversity of the Baltic Sea are eutrophication, overfishing, pollution with various substances, including oil and the introduction of non-indigenous species.
The levels of nutrient inputs to the Baltic Sea from Poland have declined with investment in wastewater treatment, but Poland remains a large contributor to pollution in the Baltic Sea. Environmental pressures from nutrients have not been decoupled from agricultural production and remain a threat to water quality. Although 36% of Polandis maritime areas are protected, further efforts are needed to strengthen the management of marine Natura 2000 sites. Moreover the Polish fish processing industry remains one of the largest in Europe. In order to ensure the sustainable development of maritime areas, it is important to improve knowledge of the condition of habitats in the Baltic Sea and coastal zones, as well as the protection of nature and biodiversity and the sustainable use of natural resources.
Priorities
 
Given the increasing scale of spatial conflicts caused by the increasing number of uses of marine space, it has become necessary to redefine the ways in which the benefits of the sea can be reaped and to ensure coexistence and synergy between the various users of maritime areas and their surroundings. The spatial plan for Polish maritime areas will be a tool for coordination of various spatial activities, including implementation of investment projects in maritime areas. The premise of the proposed mechanism is the efficient and sustainable use of marine resources for various social and economic purposes, while ensuring the sustainability of non-renewable natural resources and processes in the perspective of present and future generations.
The first maritime spatial plan in the history of Poland will be adopted by 2021 and it will contribute in particular to: 
\0xEF the promotion of sustainable development in the maritime sector, taking into account economic, social and environmental aspects, including the improvement of the environmental status and resilience to climate change; 
\0xEF ensuring coordination of actors and uses of the sea, coherent management of maritime and coastal areas, including the resources of the Baltic Sea;
\0xEF increasing the share of the maritime sector in GDP and increasing employment in the maritime sector;
\0xEF strengthening the position of Polish seaports, increasing the competitiveness of maritime transport and ensuring maritime safety;
\0xEF the economical use of space, leaving as much room as possible for future, including currently unknown, uses of the sea;
\0xEF the effective use of maritime areas and their development potential to achieve general development goals - competitiveness, increase in employment, efficiency of state operation and cohesion in the social, economic and territorial dimension in the long term.
Maritime spatial planning and development will not replace other decision-making processes (such as Nature 2000 plans, designation of areas for national security and protection, decisions on vessel traffic separation zones, setting of maximum fishing quotas, etc.). All these processes will be complementary to each other and will have an impact on the sustainable development of maritime areas.

Strategic projects


Polish Maritime Spatial Development Plan - will be the basis for effective use of the maritime space with the application of the ecosystem approach, streamlining of procedures concerning investment processes in Polish maritime areas, strengthening the position of Polish seaports, increasing the competitiveness of maritime transport, ensuring maritime safety and increasing the share of the maritime sector in GDP. The inclusion of Polish maritime areas in spatial maritime plans will contribute to the introduction of spatial order and sustainable development in these areas.

biodiversity loss 
The good condition of nature in Poland is mainly evidenced by its diversity at the level of ecosystems and species of fauna and flora. Poland has one of the highest biodiversity indicators on the continent; as an effect of the preservation of unique landscapes resulted from the dispersion of agricultural land, the maintenance of extensive agriculture and the domination of state ownership in the forest management structure. The richness of ecosystems is determined e.g. by the constant increase in the number of common forest birds or the occurrence of large predators, i.e. wolves, lynxes and bears.
As a result of the adoption of EU regulations, a network of Natura 2000 areas, focusing on the protection of specific species of plants and animals (including birds) and natural habitats, was introduced into the national legal system. At present, the Polish Natura 2000 network consists of 145 Special Protection Areas for birds and 849 Special Areas of Conservation for habitats covering about 1/5 of the Polish territory on land.
The highest form of nature protection in the Polish legal system includes national parks, which also serve environmental education and science, as well as providing access to natural and cultural resources located on their territory. The total area of 23 national parks in Poland is almost 318 thousand ha. 
In terms of forest cover, Poland is at the forefront of Europe (forests cover almost 30% of the countryis territory). Polandis forest area represents 0.23% of the worldis forests and approximately 6% of the EUis forest area. Multifunctional and sustainable forest management guarantees the preservation of the natural wealth of Polish forests, while using their resources to meet social and economic needs.
In the Polish legal system, soil protection is connected with the wider concept of land surface protection and also includes protection against pollution and other forms of degradation. The area of degraded and devastated land is only about 0.2% (2016) of the countryis area. This land is gradually being recultivated and reused. 
Priorities
 
The state policy focuses on protection and improvement of the quality of the environment through protection of biodiversity, including area forms of nature protection, waste management system, improvement of water quality and protection of water purity, as well as modernization and development of treatment plants and sewage systems, and also air protection (elimination of sources of pollution emissions or reduction of their impact) and soil protection.
Measures
 
Given the negative impact of high intensity investments on biodiversity and nature-value areas, it will be crucial to assess and verify protected areas and their resources in order to increase the effectiveness of the protection of areas of particular natural and landscape value. In addition, mapping and valuation of ecosystem services will be carried out. Also adaptation of the standards of the spatial planning and management system and introduction of changes in the management of protected areas	in	order	to	reduce	the	natural	conflict	of	conservation	of	highly	valued values will be done.
It is important to identify the landscape resources in the whole country, including the designation and protection of the most valuable, priority Polish landscapes. Measures for the preservation of landscapes and natural resources are implemented under the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020. In the longer term the development of green and blue infrastructure in urbanised areas is planned. It will also be important to maintain and increase the countryis overall forest cover.
cultural and forest land productivity. 
Strategic projects


Landscape audits - their aim is a methodologically consolidated identification, characterisation and assessment of landscape resources, which will allow to determine priority landscapes, i.e. areas most valuable for the society in terms of preservation of natural and cultural heritage of Poland and the definition of recommendations and conclusions for these areas and other protected areas (both natural and cultural) in terms of their development and protection. Landscape audits will constitute the basis for measures in the process of spatial planning and development of the most valuable landscapes, as well as will contain substantive premises for verification and development of a network of protected areas.



Water for agriculture - a programme of support for family farms and improvement of water management in agriculture in conditions of temporary shortages and excess of water.


Protection of soil against degradation will also be an important area of activity, in order to preserve its proper functions (ecological and economic). This also applies to urban development and the preservation and full utilisation of soil production capacity in rural areas with a continuing agricultural function. Activities will be conducted in the direction of implementation of the principle of priority of secondary use	of	space	in	investment	processes,	identification	of	contaminated	soils and support for their remediation, as well as protection of agri-

Measures
 
Measures will be taken to improve the quality of drafting and implementation of legislative and regulatory instruments, while enhancing public participation in lawmaking processes. Actions will be implemented to improve the competencies of participants in the process of lawmaking and monitoring, as well as to increase the transparency of legislation. Moreover, activities will be undertaken aimed at shaping conscious and responsible attitudes conducive to cooperation, creativity and communication between the administration and civil society institutions. Strong civil society organisations contribute to dense social networking and community building, thereby increasing public	confidence	in	government	policies.
The functioning of the judiciary remains a challenge: improvement of the judiciary and prosecution, introduction of modern methods of court management, a mechanism for verifying the effectiveness of proceedings, incentive mechanisms, alternative dispute resolution. It is important to increase the computerisation of courts, as well as the quality of the education system for judges and prosecutors.
Creating a system of strategic coordination and management of the countryis development is key to proper management of the countryis development policy. It is important to consolidate and strengthen the development management system through the implementation of a project approach in the administration, development of a system for monitoring and evaluation of public policies and closer integration of spatial and social and economic planning.
In this context, it is important to strengthen the social dialogue in the country at various levels - national, sectoral and enterprise.
Equally important is the introduction of modern communications tools, enabling	efficient	communication	within	the	administration	and	with	the citizen, development of computerization of the country through making available a wide range of public administration services by electronic means. From this point of view, it is important to develop standards of customer service in the common courts. This will ensure efficient	management	and	communication	and	will	enable	customers	to obtain uniform information on the services provided by court employees, as well as service taking into account the same procedures throughout the country. In turn, as part of the implementation of the e-Payments system, a single payment platform for all e-services provided by the Ministry of Justice and common courts was also created, and the ICT system of the National Court Register was included in the system of European registers BRIS. The implementation of the e-DOK document circulation system in the Penitentiary Service is also a sign of increased computerisation in the judiciary.
Particular attention will be paid to ensuring the sustainability of public	finances	from	the	point	of	view	of	guaranteeing	the	countryis	sources	of	financing	for	development.	In	order	to	maintain	budgetary	balance, regulatory and institutional changes will be introduced to tighten the tax system.
Security and foreign policy aimed at protecting against threats, especially those related to terrorism, are also very important. It remains important to prevent and combat crime by strengthening border protection and migration control, improving the management of national security and ultimately the capacity of the armed forces.
As a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, Poland considers it one of its priorities to support the Councilis efforts to uphold the international law. Appreciating the importance of the correlation between development and security, Poland actively participates in the discussion on this interdependence at the Security Council. We are thus	working	to	increase	the	confidence	of	the	international	community	in the Security Council and in the UN as a whole. By doing so we also contribute to making it more sensitive to the most pressing issues affecting lives of the citizens of the UN member states.

SDG 17 
Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable 
development 
Poland supports global efforts to implement the 2030 
Agenda. Development cooperation is an integral part of 
Polandis foreign policy. Its main objective is to support the sustainable economic and social development of the partner countries and their populations, with particular emphasis on poverty reduction.
Acting pursuant to the Act on development cooperation28, the Minister of Foreign Affairs coordinates development cooperation through the National Coordinator for Development Cooperation at the rank of the Undersecretary of State in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Act also established the Development Cooperation Policy Council functioning alongside the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs, which is an advisory and consultative body. Its role is crucial e.g. in the pursuit of development policy cohesion. Polish aid is also institutionally linked to the Solidarity Fund, whose role is to promote democracy and strengthen civil society. 
Development cooperation shall be carried out in the framework of the Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme 2016-20. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs prepares annual Development Cooperation Plans, which indicate e.g. specific allocations of Official Development Assistance (ODA) for selected priority countries and programmes. 
In 2005-16, Polish Official Development Assistance (ODA) maintained an upward trend. ODA/GNI29 ratio remains stable and accounted for 0.15% of GNI in 2016. In 2016, Polandis ODA amounted to over USD 600 million, which is an increase of approximately 43% compared to the previous year. Over 73% of Polish ODA was granted through multilateral organisations, including first of all through European Union external financial instruments. The European Union remains Polandis most important channel of development assistance.
Priorities
 
The geographical priorities of Polish development aid include the countries of the Eastern Partnership30, Asia, Africa and the Middle East. For 2016-20, 6 main thematic areas of assistance have been selected:

Measures 
 
In addition to multilateral development assistance, Poland also participates in bilateral cooperation. These are projects implemented by government administration bodies and their subordinates, through non-governmental organisations, local government units, public universities, research institutes, the Polish Academy of Sciences and its organisational units under the open tendering procedure Polish Development Assistance, Humanitarian Aid in the Middle East and 
Ukraine, Global Education, Polish Aid Volunteering 2018, as well as projects implemented through Polish foreign institutions under the Small Grant System. In addition, Poland ensures policy coherence for development (i.e. developmental, foreign and domestic) by avoiding actions that negatively affect global development and the development capacities of other countries. Two priority areas are currently being implemented:	Support	to	the	fight	against	illicit	financial	flows	and	Dissemination and implementation of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR/RBC) standards.
Examples of initiatives 
 
KENYA - project Training and refurbishing of fire brigades in Kenya. Increasing	the	capacity	of	fire	brigades	and	emergency	services	in	the	six counties of Kenya to cope with the risks and consequences of natural and	man-made	disasters,	improving	the	fire	safety	of	the	population	and enhance the investment attractiveness of the regions concerned.
LEBANON - the humanitarian aid programme for Syrian refugees in 
Lebanon, launched in 2012, is the largest humanitarian aid initiative co-financed	by	Poland	in	the	Middle	East.	Its	direct	beneficiaries	at	that time were 47 thousand Syrian refugees and over 20 thousand Lebanese citizens. 
MOLDOVA - projects in the area of migration management, preventing	and	combating	trafficking	in	human	beings,	preventing	and	combating organised crime (including cross-border crime) and training for	firefighters	in	the	field	of	recognising	and	eliminating	hazards	during	fires,	chemical	and	technical	rescue	(including	providing	Moldovan services with rescue equipment). 
It should also be pointed out that apart from the external dimension, Poland uses the idea of partnership in the implementation of national policy priorities, and thus measures for the implementation of sustainable development objectives on the national ground. An example is the Multilateral Partnership Declaration launched in 2017 by the Ministry of Economic Development (more in the next chapter).

Dialogue, cooperation, partnership for the achievement of SDGs in Poland
The complexity and permeability of SDGs requires the involvement of a wide range of stakeholders from different backgrounds in the process of achieving the objectives, thus creating a social and institutional partnership for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. 
We focus on cooperation, partnership and joint responsibility of public entities, businesses and citizens for the development processes. We are guided by the principle of Polandis strong due to cooperation, which means involvement and extensive cooperation between public and private entities, non-governmental organisations, the	scientific	sector	and	civil	society	at	various	stages	of	planning	and	implementing development activities. Therefore, various entities not only co-become participants of development activities, but also they co-create them, which strengthens the sense of joint responsibility for their course. This concerns both horizontal cooperation, between individual headings and areas of intervention of public policies, and vertical	cooperation	between	individual	levels	of	influence:	central,	regional and local. Such an approach is consistent with the 2030 Agenda commitment no one will be left behind. 
Considering that cooperation is particularly important on the way to a more sustainable future, eliminating poverty in all its forms and ensuring conditions for sustainable social and economic growth, in June 2017 the Partnership for the Implementation of the SDGs in Poland was initiated in Poland. The aim of the Partnership is to integrate representatives of various circles in cooperation for effective achievement of sustainable development objectives. The initiative increases the awareness of sustainable development goals, their importance for individual social groups and the need to cooperate in their effective implementation among growing number of stakeholders. The signatories provide an example of active involvement and responsible implementation of the principles of sustainable development within the organisation, providing a valuable source of inspiration for others. 

Under the Partnership, the signatories sign a jointly agreed declaration of intent: 
Apart from signing the declaration, the signatories of the Partnership	make	an	individual	commitment,	in	which	they	confirm	the	implementation	of	specific	actions	aimed	at	achieving	selected	SDGs,	adequate to their activities. Acceding to the Partnership and making a commitment takes place within the framework of cyclical conference events. So far, more than 70 organisations representing a wide range of stakeholders have entered into partnerships, with a total of more than 130 commitments.
The	abovementioned	projects	often	concern	the	fulfilment	of	more	than one of the 2030 Agenda SDGs. The main goals are usually SDG 4 - good quality of education and SDG 12 - responsible production and consumption. Many commitments also underline the importance of	SDG	17,	a	partnership	to	be	implemented	as	a	\0xD1leverage	to	fulfil	many other declarations. Polish companies and organisations are also taking a number of measures to contribute to climate protection, thereby complying with SDG 13. 
Most of the signatories are representatives of the business community. There is a change in the approach of enterprises, which more and more often modify their strategies in response to megatrends in the development of the world economy. Enterprises recognize the interdependence of development processes, correctly identify challenges for the industry and sector and take decisive adjustment measures, becoming an active actor of social and economic changes in the country. What is important, enterprises and business environment institutions in Poland are characterised by increasing market maturity and awareness of their impact on the environment and more and more often engage in shaping public debate by actively participating in activities aimed at adaptation of the Polish economy to new development trends and challenges. Therefore, the partnership enjoys great interest from the business community.
Participation in the Partnership is voluntary and open to all interested parties. It is undoubtedly a good thing that representatives of social and economic and non-governmental organisations are also actively joining the Partnership. We are also counting on further accession of academic, youth and local communities. We are taking steps to intensify	cooperation	in	this	area	with	regions	(Marshalis	Offices)	and cities in order to increase awareness and sense of responsibility for the success of the process of achieving Sustainable Development Goals also in the local dimension. 
The initiator and signatory of the government partnership was the 
Minister of Economic Development. Together with his signature, he made a commitment to establish a National Stakeholder Forum for the achievement of the SDGs. The Forum is a platform for conducting a substantive debate, exchanging information and experiences, and establishing effective cooperation between representatives of various circles	for	the	benefit	of	the	implementation	of	SDGs	in	Poland.	The	
Forum focuses on creating practical added value by formulating recommendations for the administration and other participants of the process in order to create appropriate conditions for effective implementation of SDGs in Poland. In addition, the Forum aims to:
\0xEF create a space for mutual learning and exchange of experiences in	the	field	of	policies	and	good	practices	in	the	implementation	of SDGs;
\0xEF strengthen cooperation at national, regional and local level and address supraregional issues;
\0xEF provide a platform for the participation of all stakeholders, including social and economic partners, organisations, academia, academia, the private sector, administrations at all levels;
\0xEF actively participate in the process of preparing Poland for the review of the state of SDGs implementation during the HLPF.
 
The Forumis discussion is adjusted to the theme and work programme of the UN HLPF for a given year, and at the same time it focuses on those aspects which concern in particular the activities and development prospects of Poland. The Forum is organised once a year in cooperation with the signatories of the SDGs Implementation Partnership and other partners.
The Forum will be organised under the direction of the Programming Council as a consultative and advisory body. Its tasks will include:
\0xEF supporting the national coordinator in regular activities aimed at the implementation of sustainable development objectives in Poland, monitoring and reviewing the implementation of the 2030 Agenda; 
\0xEF analysis	of	key	processes	and	phenomena	influencing	the	implementation of Sustainable Development Goals, with particular emphasis on the impact of policies, programmes and strategies in the internal and external dimension in various sectors and social and economic areas;
\0xEF defining	the	directions	of	the	debate	conducted	within	the	National	Stakeholder Forum and cross-sectional issues related to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and assessing the progress in the implementation of SDGs in the country in an integrated and coherent manner;
\0xEF formulating opinions and recommendations on the activities of the national coordinator for the effective achievement of global development goals at the national and local levels.
 
The activities of the Programming Council and the organisation of meetings of the National Stakeholder Forum for the implementation of SDGs in Poland are in line with SDG 17 of the 2030 Agenda, which concerns the strengthening of the implementation measures and the revitalisation of the global partnership for sustainable development. 
Key conclusions and future plans
 
Poland takes a responsible approach to the implementation of the 
2030 Agenda. The adoption of the 2030 Agenda in September 2015 and the start of its implementation coincided with the development and implementation of a new approach to development policy as set out in the medium-term Strategy for Responsible Development. In	order	to	define	the	directions	of	the	future	social	and	economic	policy, an in-depth macroeconomic analysis of Poland was carried out. Strengths and development potentials were determined. At the same	time,	key	development	gaps	were	identified	and	directions	for	concentration	of	public	intervention	around	these	areas	were	identified	in such a way as to eliminate developmental inequalities and social disproportions within the country. As a result of the measures taken, the abovementioned Strategy was developed.
The	SRD	is	the	result	of	a	reflection	on	the	identified	development	traps of the Polish economy and serves to present a new economic paradigm adopted by the Government of the Republic of Poland. At the same time, as a result of an in-depth analysis of the coherence of the SRD with the 2030 Agenda, a high compliance of the national strategy with the global Sustainable Development Goals can be seen. The Strategy therefore responds to the international challenges of sustainable development and the megatrends of the global economy, and to the need to rethink national development policies to ensure that	the	benefits	of	development	can	be	reaped	by	present	and	future	generations alike.
As part of a comprehensive approach to the implementation of SDGs, additional studies and analyses were undertaken to determine the scale and strength of interaction between the various objectives and targets of the 2030 Agenda, with a view to identifying the areas with the greatest impact that could accelerate the effective implementation of SDGs and should serve as a reference for public policies. Using econometric models, factors, areas of public policy expenditures and their effects were analysed, taking into account Polish macroeconomic conditions.
Taking	into	account	the	lists	of	outlays	influencing	the	effects	in	the	areas of SDG activity, a grouping of factors was created based on the impact on several objectives at the same time. In order to show the interaction between public expenditure and individual SDG areas, network analysis based on the Kamada-Kawai model of identifying separate factors was used.14 
The analysis shows that for Poland the most important issues in relation to the Sustainable Development Goals are poverty reduction and ensuring sustainable development of cities and communities. It is equally important to ensure good quality education, gender equality and the reduction of inequality in the country. It also remains important to promote a peaceful and inclusive society by ensuring access to justice for all and by building effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.
Action on access to clean water and sanitation, climate action and the protection of oceans, seas and marine resources will be essential to achieve the ambitious vision of the 2030 Agenda in Poland. Measures and feedback between economic growth and decent work and responsible consumption and production will be equally important. Investment in the protection of biodiversity, which has an impact on health and quality of life, sustainable urban development and the climate, should also be considered crucial.
Increased outlays under public policies in these areas should bring the desired effect and constitute a lever for effective implementation of Sustainable Development objectives in Poland. 
To increase the effectiveness of achieving SDGs in the coming years, the following matters seem particularly important for Poland:
\0xEF Selective intervention - mainly in the areas where increased outlays bring measurable effects, including reducing marginal energy consumption	per	capita	by	households,	increasing	energy	efficiency,	increasing gross expenditure on R&D, supporting research on agriculture, increase in organic farming; 
\0xEF Education for sustainable development - implementation of educational and information projects raising awareness of the principles of sustainable development and their importance, and of the 2030 Agenda and SDGs in various environments and social groups;
\0xEF Effective monitoring - the system for monitoring sustainable development in Poland plays a crucial role in assessing progress. There	is	a	need	to	refine	and	operate	SDG	indicators	to	measure	the achievement of individual SDGs;
\0xEF Coherence of Development Policy - the international character of the Agenda and the mutual interpenetration of the sustainable development goals indicate the need to review all future development strategies in terms of the coherence of sustainable development policies, their impact on the implementation of the principle of sustainable development and the achievement of the sustainable development goals. It is also necessary to jointly programme the multiannual development cooperation policy and the national development strategies after 2020;
\0xEF A well-functioning organizational structure - taking measures to strengthen the organisational structure within the framework of coordination, management and monitoring of the implementation of sustainable development objectives in Poland - strengthening the national coordinator for the implementation of objectives in human and	financial	resources,	so	that	ambitious	dissemination	plans	and	efficient	implementation	of	goals	have	a	chance	of	success.	It	is	also	crucial to ensure the continuation of the activities of the Task Force for the Coherence of the Strategy for Responsible Development with the 2030 Agenda, as well as the National Stakeholder Forum 
as platforms for the cooperation of representatives of various circles in the partnership for the active implementation of SDGs in Poland
As part of the process of implementation of the 2030 Agenda, Poland has developed solutions which may constitute good practices/experiences for other countries involved in the process: 
\0xEF Project approach to process coordination in Poland. Our experience shows that the real effects are most visible and are achieved as quickly as possible through the implementation of specific,	even	the	smallest	initiatives,	undertakings	and	projects.	Therefore, within the framework of coordination activities, we focused on setting milestones which, implemented within the project approach, allow us to successively achieve subsequent stages by improving strategic management of the entire process (the SRD strategic projects, the 2030 Agenda project);
\0xEF Participatory model of cooperation. The applied practices of integrating various environments around the challenge of implementation of Sustainable Development Goals increase the sense of shared responsibility of various environments for the success of transformational changes towards sustainable development of the country. Ultimately, the active participation of stakeholders in public	policy-making	increases	their	confidence	in	the	authorities	
and	their	willingness	to	engage	in	dialogue	to	find	common	solutions.	
(Task Force for the Coherence of the Strategy for Responsible Development with the 2030 Agenda);
\0xEF Initiatives of the national coordinator. Openness to dialogue and creation of space for systematic exchange of knowledge, information and good practices, in our opinion is the best programme of market self-education. Mutual inspiration has the effect of raising market awareness of the challenges of sustainable development and a sense of equality as to how governments, organisations, businesses, local communities	and	individual	citizens	can	influence	the	opportunities	for change.

Synthesis of the report on 
public consultations of the document 
The draft report was presented to the public and a wide range of partners in order to learn their opinions and observations. The consultations were conducted on the basis of \0xDF 38(1) Resolution No. 190 of the Council of Ministers of 29 October 2013 - the works regulations of the Council of Ministers between 6 and 27 April 2018 (M.P.	(Official	Gazette)	from	2016	item	1006,	as	amended).
The information on the commencement of consultations was sent directly to ministries, the Chancellery of the Prime Minister and members of the Council of Ministers, the Social Dialogue Council and to selected parliamentary committees, organisations and institutions, including	those	gathering	the	scientific	community,	the	business	community, farmers, as well as foundations, agencies and institutes. Voivodeships and voivodeship marshals were also informed about the start of the consultations. The Trade Union Forum, the National Commission of the Solidarity Trade Union Association and the 
All-Poland Alliance of Trade Unions were also invited to participate in the consultations. Moreover, information on the commencement of consultations was made available on the website of the Ministry of Entrepreneurship and Technology - both on the home page, in the news, and dedicated tab, thanks to which the draft report was available to all stakeholders. A special form was prepared to allow entities and individuals to submit comments.
In total, more than 200 contributions, comments and opinions were received from more than 30 stakeholders during the consultation process. All the opinions expressed in the consultation were analysed in	the	course	of	work	on	the	final	version	of	the	report.	
The comments submitted in the consultations were characterised by different levels of detail and nature. These were both substantive proposals	for	additions	and	clarifications	to	the	existing	provisions,	comments on the existing state of affairs, and editorial remarks. The comments made during the consultations were taken into account to a large extent, which allowed the report to be properly developed and influenced	the	introduction	of	significant	corrections	and	additions	to the provisions of the draft report, particularly in the area of poverty reduction, health care, creating the labour market to ensure decent work, entrepreneurship, social dialogue, education, air protection and climate in general as well as environmental resources, highlighting the role of local governments, selection of statistical indicators. The report also took into account selected examples of initiatives taken in support of the Sustainability Targets, among those proposed in the consultation.
Many comments contained proposals and solutions, which were too detailed in the context of the general, synthetic nature of the presented report. There were also opinions that the report contained too many references to the Strategy for Responsible Development (SRD), while the document, as a report on the implementation of the goals of the 2030 Agenda and not SRD, should be more based on information from other sources. It should be stressed that, in accordance with Article 21 of the UN Resolution on the 2030 Agenda, each country is responsible for its implementation at national, regional and global level, taking into account its realities, capacities and priorities. The 2030 Agenda and its goals are implemented in Poland through the Strategy for Responsible Development. Due to the fact that the key document is	the	SRD	-	a	comprehensive	strategy	defining	objectives,	areas	and	development priorities by 2030 - the Task Force for the Coherence of the Strategy for Responsible Development with the 2030 Agenda and its SDGs agreed that the Report on the achievement of the SDGs should be synthetic, clear, present the priorities and key measures. Other countries also prepare reports under the VNR in this manner.
