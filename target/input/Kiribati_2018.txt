As a Small Island State spread across 33 atolls and 3.5 million square kilometres of ocean (an area larger than India), Kiribati is faced with a number of development challenges. In addition to being one of the countries most affected by climate change, Kiribati is also constrained by geographic isolation, a highly dispersed population, high transport costs, and a low population base. The relative infertility of its coral islands and distance to markets prohibits agricultural or industrial production on a large scale.  
While still rated as one of the poorest countries in the Pacific region, there has been remarkable progress on increasing economic opportunities, particularly since 2014 when there was a significant increase in Government fishing revenues. Increasing employment opportunities in the public and private sector have been complimented by increases in overseas worker schemes, although this growth has not been enough to lower unemployment, which remains high.  
It is well known that climate change is a serious challenge for Kiribati, affecting almost every facet of daily life. From acute water shortages, tidal inundation, seawater intrusion, and heat and storm events, Kiribati risks reversing recent development gains through both slow and rapid onset climate events. The Government of Kiribati is working with development partners to adapt to climate change, with significant works underway in transport, water, power, sanitation, coastal protection and food security, but the rate of change threatens to outpace development improvements. Importantly, climate change has the potential to disrupt the largest economic resource available to Kiribati n the tuna fishery n through anticipated impacts on tuna migration and spawning patterns across the Pacific 
Developing an educated and healthy workforce remains vital to providing broad-based economic opportunities and creating economic resilience. Recent years have seen significant advances in school enrolment rates, basic literacy, and numeracy, particularly for girls and young women. There have also been improvements in geographical accessibility, teacher qualifications and free-to-access education. However, the high costs of service delivery and limited capacity at tertiary institutions to absorb school-leavers remain challenging issues. Education outcomes among young males are not showing the same level of success, with male students less likely to progress to the next stage of schooling. 
UNDP Human Development Indicators in 2016 place Kiribati at a low rank of 137, a decline from its rank of 133 in 2014. With relatively low-income levels and a high cost of service delivery, there are significant gaps in the provision of public services. For example, until 2017 regular power on the main island was rare, and the majority of homes do not have water or sanitation. Major investments by the Government and Development Partners have improved utilities in the capital (Tarawa) but access to basic infrastructure and services is generally limited, especially in the outer islands, where just under half of the population live. 
Kiribatiis health challenges remain stark: under 5 and maternal mortality rates remain the highest in the Pacific; malnutrition is a common issue; there is a high level of stunting; non-communicable disease prevalence is high; and tuberculosis is persistent. There are frequent outbreaks of diarrhoea caused by poor water, sanitation and hygiene practices. Mosquito-borne disease outbreaks (such as Dengue and Chikungunya) are frequent, and public health and food safety issues are pronounced. The ability of the government services to respond to these multiple challenges is strained, and while this area has been a focus of the major development partners, much work remains to be done.  
While there has been iterative progress in some aspects of inclusiveness, gender-based violence, support for people with disabilities, and broader gender issues are critical social and economic issues. 
The SDGs in Kiribati 
Following the launch of the SDGs in September 2015, the Government issued the preliminary national indicators to all government agencies, community groups, development partners and private sector organisations. This led to the formation of the Kiribati Development Plan (KDP) 2016-19 and a national set of indicators.  
In addition to the four-yearly national plan, the Kiribati Government also has a 20-year vision for the development of a wealthy, healthy, and peaceful nation. Covering the period up to 2036, the Kiribati Vision 20 (or KV20) is designed around the enabling environment and social benefits from the key economic sectors of tourism and fisheries. 
As the KDP broadly aligns to the 2030 Agenda, the integration of the Mid-Term Review of the KDP with the Voluntary National Review (VNR) aims to assess national goals alongside international and regional commitments in a single report. 
The Process for the Review 
The Development Coordination Committee (DCC) is the main governing body that coordinates and reports on all development activity in Kiribati including the review of the KDP.  
Following the appointment of a special SDG Taskforce from among DCC members, an intensive consultation period commenced with all stakeholders. Each partner was educated on the importance of the SDGs, data collection, and the timeline for the Review. Stakeholder consultations identified issues with capacity constraints; competing priorities; stakeholder engagement; lack of alignment between the national, regional and global indicator sets; insufficient resources; baseline data issues; and poor capacity to collect and analyse data.  
The Review of the KV20, KDP and SDG indicators highlighted several areas of indicator fragmentation and poor data collection. In particular, some global, regional, and even national indicators are currently beyond the capability of Kiribati to effectively measure and report on. 
Stakeholders and government agencies verified what data was available and reviewed the final report prior to it being tabled with the High-Level Political Forum. 
Outcomes of the Review 
Following the Review, national goals and indicators will be realigned for the second half of the fouryear term of the KDP. Together with the developing framework for the KV20, there is substantial scope to further reduce fragmentation of planning documents and indicators. Time and resource constraints during the Review also meant coverage of the outer islands and youth groups was limited n future reviews should aim to provide better coverage of both urban and rural Kiribati, leaving no one behind.  However, the national planning documents, particularly the KV20, have gone through a more extensive consultation process which includes visits to the outer islands communities. 
Kiribati continues to face limited institutional and financial capacity to effectively monitor and implement the SDGs.  Continued support by development partners is important and valued, especially in light of the potential graduation of Kiribati from least developed country status. To this end, Kiribati extends the invitation to development partners to continue their support towards achieving the SDGs. While the fiscal capacity of Kiribati has improved dramatically in recent years, there are still sizeable financing gaps in transport, utilities, and social infrastructure, especially as the existing infrastructure comes under increasing pressure from the impacts of climate change. Technical assistance in the key policy areas of public financial management, planning, engineering, health, education, and good governance are also key gaps that will need increased in support. The cost-tails of infrastructure investments may also create an ongoing fiscal burden on Government, which may stretch operational resources in other areas. 
 	 

2 Introduction 
Recognising the development challenge, the Kiribati Government firmly took ownership of the SDGs in the formulation of its national plan for the period 2016-2019: the KDP.  
All SDG targets and indicators have been reviewed and assessed for relevance to Kiribatiis context, including initial country conditions in each Key Priority Area (KPA) and accounting for possible progress in the four-year timeframe of the Plan. The KDP 2016-19 takes into account various international initiatives that the Government of Kiribati has assented to. These include the SDGs, the Istanbul Plan of Action, the Small Island Developing States (SIDS) Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway and the Framework for Pacific Regionalism. 
The table below illustrates how the KDP maps against these global commitments.

The Mid-Term Review of the KDP, due by mid-2018, assesses the progress on each KPA to be presented to the Government, community and development partners. As the KDP fully aligns to the 2030 Agenda, this process also serves as the main vehicle for reviewing Kiribatiis progress on the SDGs n the two processes are tightly interwoven. The KDP Mid-Term Review also sets the stage for the next phase of the national planning cycle, and as such, is the key evaluation platform for national development. 
As the KDP is fully localised, this report is structured around the evaluation of each KPA, as is required under the Kiribati Mid-Term Review. As will be evident in the report, this approach also reports on the SDGs relevant for Kiribati, thereby serving the twin goal of acting as Kiribatiis Voluntary National Review.  
The Governmentis 20-year vision for Kiribati (or the KV20) is a further illustration of Governmentis commitment to development n a dream and a statement of its strong aspiration to transform Kiribati into a wealthy, healthy and peaceful nation.  KV20 sets the national direction out to 2036 and is focused on maximising the economic and social benefit out of two key economic sectors: Fisheries and Tourism. The KV20 calls for maximizing our natural, human and cultural capital to leverage development outcomes.  
Given the evolving nature of a 20-year vision and the significant cross-over with the KDP and SDG, the KV20 indicators are also included in this review. 
 
3 Methodology for the Preparation of the Review: 
Government approved the commencement of the VNR process in Kiribati in December 2017. The VNR Secretariat was hosted by the National Economic and Planning Office (NEPO) in the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MFED), with the support of the National SDG Consultant, who was generously funded by UNESCAP in January 2018. The Minister of Finance approved the formation of the National SDG Taskforce to assist in the review that same month, with this Taskforce being drawn from the Development Coordination Committee (which oversees all development activities). 
The first meeting for the exchange and sharing of information with all stakeholders (central and local administration, civil society, private sector, development partners), was held on 24  January 2018.  It served to outline the High-Level Political Forum and to present the scope of the report and its formulation process.  Presentations were made on the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs, the KDP 20162019, and the Kiribati VNR n highlighting data needs and progress updates by KDP and SDG partners in both Government and non-government sectors. 
This first consultation also agreed on the main principles of the review, namely that the review would be: open and transparent, inclusive, and participatory for all. Stakeholders also committed that the VNR would demonstrate on the global stage the development story of Kiribati. 
Greater involvement and consultations with both the government and non-government sector continued to be made throughout the review.  This included further consultation and dedicated meetings with the Kiribati Association of Non-Governmental Organizations (KANGO) in January, the Kiribati Chamber of Commerce and Industries (KCCI) in March, the Pacific Islands Private Sector Organisation (PIPSO) sub-regional workshop on nutrition in March, and the Pacific Island Forum (PIF) Civil Society preparatory meeting in March. This culminated in the second National VNR Stakeholder Workshop on 16 March 2018. A full list of consulted parties is available in Appendix 4. 
Capacity development for data providers and SDGs partners was also provided with support of the CROP/UN SDWG Team at the Data Providers Workshop on 1 March 2018.  The workshop served to increase awareness of the SDG and KDP indicators in particular, with a focus on improving the collection of the required data. 
Monitoring and technical support to NEPO and the national consultant were also provided through both remote and in-country technical support from UN partners (CROP/UN SDWG).  
Data collection from sectors and ministries reached its peak in March and April 2018, with the final validation workshop in late May bringing stakeholders back together for further inputs and dialogue.  Prior to the final validation workshop, the Zero-Draft was circulated to all stakeholders, with their inputs being incorporated into the Draft Review, which was circulated in early June. 
 	 
4 Policy and Enabling Environment 
4.1 Creating Ownership of the Sustainable Development Goals 
The process of enabling ownership of the SDGs is largely through integration of the SDGs in the national planning documents: the 2016-19 KDP and the KV20 n both of which had broad consultation with subnational government, civil society, NGOs, and the private sector.   
During the formulation for the 2016-19 KDP, NEPO conducted a series of awareness activities with government ministries, community groups, and development partners.  This process encouraged ownership by the Kiribati people and fostered closer partnership between Kiribati and development partners. The 2016-19 KDP also took into account the Mid-Term Review of the 2012-15 KDP which was undertaken by representatives from NEPO, UNESCAP, UNDP Pacific Centre, SPREP, and PIFS. Lessons learned from the 2012-15 KDP Mid-term Review were incorporated into the design of the 2016-19 Plan. In particular, there were focussed discussions on ensuring the alignment of the KDP and UNDAF, ensuring that the SDGs were well integrated into national systems.   
The KV20 went one step further, by taking consultations directly to the community in a series of church and community meetings over the course of 2017 and 2018. This included an extensive roster of consultative dialogues on some of the most outer-lying islands in the country. Consistent with Kiribati culture, these meetings were often held in traditional meeting houses to a relatively small gathering of the local community. In some cases, this led to a refinement of the national vision in response to community feedback. 
The processes for ownership has created an \0xEBenabling environmenti for the close integration of the SDGs into national planning frameworks and in the development of relevant policies, legal reviews, and updates that enhance efforts to address key priorities of the KDP and implementation of the SDGs. 
The VNR and 2016-19 KDP Mid-Term Review focused on community groups and peak-body organisations as the main rallying point for community engagement, due largely to time and budgetary constraints. A radio campaign during the Parliamentary Sessions in April 2018 (the most popular time to tune-in to the radio) attempted to raise awareness about the SDGs and the Review and provided information on how the general public could provide input. Radio was selected as the primary media as it is a popular medium for general news and information in Kiribati n there are no private television stations and limited private press.  
 
4.2 Incorporation into national frameworks 
The 2016-19 Kiribati Development Plan 
The 2016-19 KDP is the guide for formulating policies and programs to advance inclusive economic development in Kiribati. It does this by outlining six KPAs that focus development activity within certain areas. These KPAs are: Human Resource Development; Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction; Health; Environment; Governance; and Infrastructure.  
Each KPA includes a series of national strategies and indicators. In particular, all SDG targets and indicators have been reviewed and assessed for relevance to Kiribatiis context. A pathway approach to progressing towards achievement of the SDGs has been adopted, cognisant of guiding principles underscored in the 2030 UN Development Agenda, namely the need to account for national realities, capacities, levels of development and respecting national policies and priorities. 
All projects that are proposed by Ministries, agencies, NGOs and Island Councils have to be aligned with the principles of the KDP. The KDP provides a framework for development so that donors and government agencies have a clear understanding of the policy directions of the Government. The Plan provides an invaluable reference for development partners in aligning their assistance objectives with the priorities of the Government of Kiribati. 
Ministry Strategic Plans (MSPs) for the period 2016-19 are aligned with the KDP and provide the guiding framework for each Ministry on technical, administrative, and strategic issues. MSPs also feed into the broad priorities of the KDP, in both a top-down and bottom-up approach. Ministerial Operational Plans (MOPs) set out costed activities to progress the MSPs and feed into the budget process for the preparation of the recurrent and development budgets. 
Figure 4.1 Flowchart from the KDP to the National Budget 

 
 
 
The Kiribati Vision 20 
The KV20 is similar in this regard, but with a focus on longer term indicators and strategies n it is a long-term development blueprint for Kiribati covering the period 2016 to 2036. The Vision Statement of the KV20 is for Kiribati to become a wealthy, healthy and peaceful nation. The KV20 seeks to achieve our development aspirations by maximising the development benefits from fisheries and tourism as key productive sectors. The development of these sectors are expected to stimulate the development of other sectors through backward and forward sectoral linkages. 
While the majority of this Review analyses the KDP and the progress on the SDGs, it is important to note the strong synergies with the KV20.  
After going through extensive consultations, the KV20 is anchored on four pillars: Wealth; Peace and Security; Infrastructure; and Governance. In addition to the core Pillars, the Vision also highlights gender, youth, vulnerable groups, equity and partnership as cross cutting principles. The KV20 will mainstream equity in all the sector programmes and projects. The aim is to create an inclusive development environment that will open opportunities to all members of Kiribati society.   
Together with the 2016-19 KDP, the KV20 also recognises Kiribatiis vulnerability to climate change as a key constraint to achieving development. The Vision underscores the need to mainstream climate change adaptation and mitigation into various programmes. Mainstreaming climate change into development programming will ensure that the working environment is sensitive to environmental conservation, climate change and sustainable development.  
The Wealth Pillar aims to develop the natural capital, human capital and cultural capital to improve economic growth and reduce poverty, addressing SDG 1 (End Poverty in all its forms) and SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth).  Development of the natural capital will include implementing measures to sustainably maximise revenue from the fisheries and marine resources (SDG 8 & 14), improving contribution of the tourism sector to GDP (SDG 8), implementing strategies to support the development of inclusive trade and private sector (SDG 8), and to improve land use and planning to create additional land for commercial development (SDG 11 and 15). 
The human capital component of the Wealth Pillar is directly related to SDG 4 (Quality Education) to ensure inclusive and equitable education and life-long learning opportunities for all. This part of the KV20 seeks to create a highly educated and skilled population; increase access to decent employment; develop a highly skilled, qualified and efficient work force; and create an accessible and affordable healthcare system (SDG 3). Given its linkages to employment opportunities, creating a globally competitive and healthy human resource base is critical towards achieving the development goals of the Vision.   
The KV20 also recognises the importance of cultural capital and traditional knowledge in supporting community identity and the tourism industry, which will contribute to the achievement of the SDG Goals 4, 8 ,11 and 12, and be consistent with the Regional Culture Strategy 2010-2020. Kiribati has also acceded to International Conventions on Culture in 2018 and ratified the 2003 UNESCO Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage. Like some other Pacific nations, Kiribati is still relatively young in our cultural sector development n the KV20 will strive to complete the National Cultural Policy by the year 2019 with the support from our development partners. 
The Peace and Security Pillar aims at creating a secure, safe and peaceful Kiribati by strengthening the national security frameworks, strengthening the relevant institutions, and strategic partnerships.  This Pillar encompasses SDG 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions), but also aims to ensure adequate protection of Kiribatiis national fishery (SDG14).   
The KV20 recognizes the significant cross cutting role of infrastructure in providing basic services to the community and creating an enabling environment for the development of the fisheries and tourism. The Infrastructure Pillar which is relevant to SDG 6 (Clean water and sanitation), SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), and SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), aims at improving connectivity and accessibility in relation to economic and social infrastructure.  It seeks to improve the air, land and sea transport infrastructure, ICT, utilities, and social infrastructure (which includes education, health and community infrastructure).  
The Governance Pillar aims to create a corrupt-free society (SDG 16) by: strengthening local traditional knowledge; reviewing legislative frameworks; strengthening the integrity and independence of institutions mandated to promote good governance and eliminate corruption; strengthen strategic partnerships; and institutionalize anti-corruption and good governance principles in the public service and education systems of Kiribati. 
4.3 Integration of the three dimensions of sustainable development 
In terms of the three dimensions of sustainable development (economic, social, and environmental) the KDP makes explicit mention of all three dimensions with social issues the main focus of KPA 1, 3 and 5 (Health, Education, and Governance), economic issues covered in KPA 2 and 6, and KPA 4 (Environment) referring explicitly to environmental and climate change issues. There is substantial cross-over across the six areas. For example, fisheries development is mentioned in KPA 1 (fisheries training schemes), 2 (fisheries revenue and industry development) and 4 (sustainability and climate change issues). 
Similarly, the KV20 notes the cross-cutting nature of development. For example, the Wealth Pillar covers Human, Natural, and Cultural capital as a broad definition of what determines a nationis wealth Together with mainstreaming the cross-cutting issues of equity and environment, the KV20 also fully integrates the sustainable approach to development. 
The following are a few of the examples that illustrate how the three dimensions are integrated in the development process in Kiribati: 
I. Education is key to achievement of the SDGs and the development of a productive workforce.  An inclusive approach in the education sector for all children has successfully been adopted in the Education Act 2013 and the Compulsory Education Policy 2015. In 2016, education was also made free up until the final year of high school to ensure equitable participation by the most vulnerable groups. A subsidy scheme for school expenses is also accessible by those students with parents that are infirmed or destitute. 
II. The National Gender Equality and Womenis Development (GEWD) Policy, and the National Approach to Eliminating Sexual and Gender Based Violence (ESGBV) in Kiribati attempts to address gender and domestic violence issues to ensure inclusive economic and social participation.   
III. The Phoenix Island Protected Area (PIPA) is one of the largest marine protected areas in the world, and the largest marine conservation effort of its kind by a Least Developed Country (LDC). The main driver was around ensuring the environmental and economic sustainability of Kiribatiis most important resource for its people: the national fishery. 
4.4 Leaving no-one behind 
The progress of disadvantaged groups is a key element of the KDP and KV20, with both plans explicitly highlighting the need to improve the lives of the most vulnerable.  Efforts to bridge the social and economic differences between genders, regions, socio-economic groups, and those with disabilities, is a common narrative in Kiribati n particularly in relation to disparities in service delivery to the Outer Islands. 
In terms of national systems, there have been difficulties in the disaggregation of official data that would make broad-based interventions possible. The recent launch of the Gender Extract and Disability Monograph will go some way in bridging these gaps, but even when such data is available the policy capacity to analyse the data remains thin. Additionally, the resources required to regularly collect microdata across the dispersed islands of Kiribati is a major impediment to inclusive development efforts. This often means that without development partner support, Kiribati is not well placed to gather regular intelligence on the most vulnerable n relying instead on project data or the national census to provide indicators.  
However, this has not proven to be a barrier to making concerted efforts in national plans for inclusive development. For example, in the area of education, the Education Act 2013 and Education Policy 2015 attempt to ensure inclusivity, non-discriminatory access, and gender and disability sensitivity in the provision of education.  The Government has made Junior Secondary School available in all of the islands, improving the geographical inclusion of the national curriculum up to senior years.  The Government has also taken recent steps to make primary and secondary education free to access up until the final year, which will allow those families with little or no income to send their children to school.  
For the outer islands, the recent consultations on the KV20 went to some of the most distant islands to ensure their inclusion in the national planning process. The national Outer Island Infrastructure Program (the largest contribution of government funds to an infrastructure project in Kiribati history) is an explicit recognition of the need to invest in our most vulnerable communities. Together with the subsidisation of copra production on the outer islands (which has been the largest recurrent expenditure of Government since it was doubled in 2016), this is a clear demonstration of the importance this Government places on ensuring that the economic growth being experienced at the national level contributes to the wellbeing on all islands in the country. 
4.5 Institutional Mechanisms 
At the national level, the Development Coordinating Committee (DCC) is responsible for overseeing all development activities and national plans, including progress on the SDGs. Composed of the heads of all ministries, the DCC has a broad mandate to review and coordinate development activity. The National Economic and Planning Office (NEPO), as the secretariat to the DCC, presents regular reports on project appraisals, implementation, and challenges, as well as bi-annual reports on the national plan. The Mid-Term Review informs the second half of the 2016-19 KDP implementation, feeds into the final report on the 2016-19 KDP, and contributes to the formulation of the next KDP (2020-2023). As the KDP closely links with Ministry Strategic Plans, the national indicators are integrated into core ministry activities which form the basis of performance and budgeting discussions between the ministries and Cabinet.  
A final evaluation of the 2016-19 KDP will be conducted after four and half years of the Planis implementation.  The evaluation is led by NEPO with support from development partners. The underlying principle of the evaluation is to ensure independence and objectivity. 
As the KDP represents the medium term aims of the KV20, the review cycle of the KV20 is also linked to that of the KDP. The overall monitoring and evaluation will remain with NEPO, but specific activities, monitoring, and evaluation will be an internal management activity conducted by the implementing agencies as specified in the implementation matrix. These reviews will be used to iteratively improve the planning and implementation process of the KV20. The KDP Mid-Term Review will also serve to populate the baseline indicators of the KV20. 
For the 2016-19 KDP Mid-Term Review and SDG VNR, a specific SDG Taskforce was approved by the Minister of Finance in January 2018 to focus NEPO reporting to the DCC. This Taskforce was structured around a representative from each of the six KPAs of the 2016-19 KDP, as well as the National Statistics Office, NEPO, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, with secretariat support from a UN funded TA. Consistent with the process for national policy reviews, the DCC tabled the findings of the Review with Cabinet for their final endorsement before being presented at the UN HLPF. 
4.6 Structural Issues 
Kiribati faces stark development challenges across a wide range of areas. While the national planning frameworks of the 2016-19 KDP and the KV20 are comprehensive in their coverage, and consistent with the SDGs, adequate institutional capacity and financing to implement these plans continue to be challenging.  
The relatively small population of Kiribati and attractive incomes elsewhere in the region have resulted in poor institutional capacity to implement major projects, reforms, and policies. This has led to a need for external technical assistance in a number of key areas of Government so that major policies can go ahead. However, even with this support there are still significant institutional gaps that prevent effective implementation at the functional level n with public service reforms and improvements in service delivery sorely needed. Dispersed population centres, poor communication, and a congested work agenda have also hampered intragovernment, subnational, and community coordination. 
In terms of financing, while Kiribati enjoys a small fiscal surplus and comfortable cash reserve, it could not possibly fund all of its development needs from domestic revenue sources n indeed, much of the KDP and KV20 aspirations are yet to have a funding source identified. This is particularly true for major infrastructure needs, which even if provided at only basic levels would exceed national GDP many times over. Even if the healthy balance of the Kiribati sovereign wealth fund (the RERF), which is approaching AUD1 billion, were to be used to finance infrastructure needs it would be exhausted within only a few years. This has meant that development activities, particularly infrastructure, have largely been funded by development partners. For example, the recent scale up in the World Bank allocation for Kiribati and, to a lesser extent, the Asian Development Bank, have enabled keystone investments in transport, water, sanitation and outer island infrastructure that simply would have not been possible otherwise.  
In terms of domestic revenue mobilisation, the introduction of a VAT system, improved tax compliance, and an increase in fisheries revenue (due in large part to the Vessel Day Scheme under the Parties to the Nauru Agreement) have significantly improved the ability of the government to provide essential services. The increase in revenue since 2014 has enabled the increase in the copra price scheme for the outer islands, the increased adequacy of public service pay, enabled free basic education, and increased the financing to health and education programs. The additional revenue has also enabled greater participation of the Government of Kiribati in development and infrastructure spending. While this will most certainly translate to general improvements, the high cost of service delivery (especially in the outer islands), creates additional challenges that are not easily addressed. 
Despite recent successes, there is still a long way to go before development ambitions are achieved, with institutional capacity and financing continuing to be key challenges. With the increased impacts of climate change on health, infrastructure, and social programs, this development challenge is likely to only get more pronounced over coming years. 
Outside of capacity and financing issues, data collection and analysis are key weaknesses to effective monitoring and evaluation. As is clearly demonstrated in this Review, there are significant overlaps in the goals of the SDGs, the KDP and the KV20. While this has produced a coherent set of focus areas across planning documents at the higher level, there is significant fragmentation at the indicator level. The challenge of monitoring and evaluating the multiple sets of indicators has stretched already thin institutional capacity for statistics, with Kiribati unable to report on many of the national, regional, and global indicators. Indeed, the fragmented national indicator set is one of the key opportunities for improvement identified by this Review and will be a priority for the second-half of 2016-19 KDP implementation. 	 
5 Progress on Goals and Targets 
 
KPA 1: Human Resource Development SDG Goal 4: Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning 
 
 
 
Early, Primary, and Secondary education 
The basic education system of Kiribati is made up of pre-school (3 to 5 years old) primary school (Years 1 to 6) and Junior Secondary School (JSS - Forms 1 to 3 / Years 7-9). This is further supplemented by 4 years of Senior Secondary Schooling (SSS) which starts from Forms 4 to 7 (Years 10-13). The primary and junior secondary components of schooling are compulsory and free while the SSS component is free only to Years 10 to 12 under the Governmentis Free Education policy. Government also approved subsidization of student transportation and stationery for primary and JSS students in 2015.   
Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) 
ECCE is a relatively new part of the national education framework. Preschools are generally provided by church, private, and community organizations with little oversight.  The new focus on life-long learning has been extended to include ECCE as the first step in the formal education process. The current Education Sector Strategic Plan (a component of both the KDP and KV20) is committed to identifying resources needed for pre-schools, and to provide training and professional development to teachers.  UNICEF has been greatly involved in supporting the Ministry of Education on improving Early Childhood Developments (ECD). A new development in this area is an ECCE legislation which was passed by House of Parliament in August 2017; regulations are in progress. 
School Accessibility and Student Participation 
The total school enrolment has increased from 27,140 in 2013 to 28,565 in 2016. However, enrolments for junior secondary school (JSS) decreased from 7,038 to 6,423 during the same period. The WASH in schools program, as supported by UNICEF through funds of the New Zealand Government, focuses on improving clean and safe drinking water, functioning sanitation and improved hygiene practices. With serious community involvement in the program, this may have played a significant contribution in the relative increase of enrolments overall. It may be too early to tell if the introduction of free senior secondary schooling (SSS) in 2016 may have had an impact on student numbers.

The progression (or survival) rate for students up to Year 5 showed an improvement from 86% to 93% between 2014 and 2016, but the opposite was true for the survival rate to Year 6, which decreased from 89% in 2014 to 74% 2016 (Figure 5.1). This suggests that there is still a large minority of young I-Kiribati who are still not receiving basic education to the end of primary school, despite it being free and compulsory. This has a significant impact on further education outcomes and represents an ongoing challenge for the education system as a whole. The Government is targeting a survival rate in primary education of 80% by 2019 and 100% by year 2036. 
The Year 6 to Year 7 transition rate improved to 98% in 2016, the same level as 2014. The support of the Australian Government through the Kiribati Education Improvement Program (KEIP) to improve the school infrastructure and standards is a significant contribution to improve studentsi attendance and retention.

The Gender Parity Index (GPI), which measures the ratio of females to males, was 1.08 in 2011 and 1.04 in 2014 indicating a consistently higher proportion of girls in school than boys across the fouryear period. No new data was provided for the 2014-2016 period but given the continued enrolment rates in tertiary institutions continue to favour females, it is likely that this trend has continued.

In terms of geographical inclusion, the Kiribati Government ensures that all islands have access to both Primary schools and JSS.  Depending on the population of children, the Education Quota system is applied to determine how many Primary and JS Schools will be on each island, with all islands having at least one.  At the district-level, at least one Senior Secondary School is available for continued secondary education (Table 5.3) n although the districts differ greatly in terms of student population and geographical area. Government provides school buses for each island along with sufficient operational cost/support to cover for fuel and servicing of the buses.  Management of the vehicles is entrusted with Island Councils.

Government previously supported free education up to JSS level in addition to providing free basic school materials such as exercise books, pencils, pens, as well as free transport to Primary School and JSS students. The Free Education policy for schooling that commenced in the second term of 2016 has also been extended to all students who have passed their exams in SSS, with a removal of the quota system that was previously in place (i.e. all students who pass are eligible). 
Box 5.1 The Kiribati School and Centre for Children with Special Needs 
The Red Cross School, now known as the Kiribati School and Centre for Children with Special Needs (or \0xECThe Special School) was established in 1991 by the Kiribati Red Cross Society.  In its first year there were 5 teachers with 35 registered students (with daily attendance between 18 to 25 students per day). Parents took over the day-to-day operations of the school in 2000. 
The Special School is currently the only institution catering for children with disabilities in Kiribati and now boasts 39 teachers and 227 registered students across preschool and primary school age.  
The Ministry of Education has been working with the Special School for mainstreaming the delivery of education to the students which has since seen 8 students (1 blind, 1 low vision, and 6 hearing impaired students) attend senior high school, 4 more students (also with hearing impairments) attend intermediate schools, and 3 (with mild intellectual impairments) attend regular primary schools. 
The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has been providing core funding to the Special school for the past 11 years, with the Government of Kiribati (via the Ministry of Education) also providing core funding for the last 5 years. Multiple donor partners, organizations and individuals have also supported a variety of projects to support the continued success of this unique institution in Kiribati. 
 
Literacy and Education Quality 
Literacy for Year 4 students has improved significantly, from 29% in 2012 to 73% in 2015. Numeracy for Year 4 has also improved, increasing from 66% in 2012 to 93% in 2015. Despite the fall in the survival rate, Year 6 literacy and numeracy levels also improved, with literacy increasing from 40% in 2012 to 56% in 2015 and numeracy improving from 43% in 2012 to 72% in 2015. These are impressive gains over a relatively short period of time and demonstrate considerable improvements in the quality of education being provided.

The Government will continue to implement measures aimed at having highly educated and skilled population. Measures available in programs such as the PEARL program that was supported by the World Bank aims at improving childrenis literacy skills.  Under the KV20, the number of school-aged children receiving formal education will aim to be increased to 85% by 2019 and 100% by 2036. Other targets include the percentage number of school drop outs to be reduced from 15% to 10% by 2019 and 3% by 2036. Government will also work towards improving English language literacy across all levels from 30% to 50% by 2019 and 100% by the year 2036. 
There are two types of academic qualifications for teachers within the Kiribati Education System. The first type of teachers is known as Qualified Teachers: those teaching at each level of education having attained at least the minimum academic qualifications required by the national authorities for giving classes at schools. The second type of teachers is known as Certified Teachers: those teachers who are certified to have completed at least the two-year teaching certificate.   
The minimum academic qualifications required by national authorities for teachers has changed from Form 5 to Form 6 (from Year 11 to Year 12) for Primary Teachers and Form 7 (Year 13) for JSS and SSS.  Certification requires a two-year teaching certificate, which can be obtained from the Kiribati Teachers College.   
Primary and JSS teacher qualification ratios fell significantly in 2015 (Figure 5.2), with Primary recovering some of this decline in 2016. This was similar for SSS teachers, with 2016 showing significant improvement from previous years. The qualification of JSS teachers remains a concern. However, the teacher qualification data for 2015 should be viewed with caution, as this was the first year that the qualification survey was done electronically (rather than paper-based) and had a lower reporting rate than in previous years. The 2016 figures are viewed to be a more accurate representation of the data. 
The Pupil Teacher Ratio (PTR) for Primary and JSS is high on South Tarawa (1:40-50) and lower on the outer islands (1:20). The Kiribati Teachers College (KTC) aims to lower the ratio for South Tarawa to 1:30 by 2023 through an increase in the annual intake to the diploma program. Teachers for the SSS are serviced by graduate teachers from USP and other tertiary institutions in the region.  The KV20 aims to improve the ratio of qualified teachers to 80% by 2019 and 100% by the year 2036 in order to promote quality education.

Support from development partners on teacher and school leader capacity building, as well as support from UNICEF on the Teacher Code of Ethics and the Child Protection in school, have assisted in improving teacher capacity in the teaching process and improving student participation in class. 
School Curriculum and other reforms 
The Primary curriculum has undergone major reforms in recent years through the Australian-funded Kiribati Education Improvement Program (KEIP). KEIP aims to improve access to quality basic education for all girls and boys, including children with disabilities. Under KEIP, Australia is working with the Government of Kiribati to provide safe and healthy learning environments, adequate resources, a modern curriculum, professional teachers, and improved management of the education system. KEIP started in 2011 and is currently in Phase III, which commenced in April 2016. The curriculum for Years 5 and 6 were addressed in 2017, with year 7 curriculum the focus of the 2018 reforms. Once the JSS curriculum has been reformed by the end of 2019, the KEIP will move on to SSS. KEIP has also been responsible for the renovation and reconstruction of around 18 schools in the urban areas of Kiribati. 
The National Curriculum and Assessment Framework (NCAF) reflects principles of child centred active learning and contains the policies and guidelines for the content, structure and delivery of the national curriculum for primary and secondary schools in Kiribati. It is very different from the past education curriculum that focused on academic learning, preparing professional students for tertiary and higher educational opportunities and non-manual work in the government sector, but neglected the majority of students seeking livelihood skills.  
The newly developed curriculum has shifted towards accommodating the disparate geographic profile of Outer Islands so that all Kiribati students have access to full and meaningful educational opportunities.  The NCAF now covers a wide-ranging view of all experiences and underlying pedagogical philosophy that is expected to contribute to the learning experience and processes. Hence there is an integrated approach that merges various aspects of teaching and learning, such as lesson activity and assessment. 
The Kiribati Curriculum applies to all schools in Kiribati, both government and private schools; all students regardless of gender, ethnic group, religion, location, background, ability or disability; and all years of formal schooling, from early primary to the completion of secondary school. 
Subjects such as Health and Family Planning are taught in both the Primary and Junior Secondary schools but more specifically at the Senior Secondary levels. For those students mainstreamed to the Arts subjects and not covering this topic, they can learn through the radio media where the Ministry of Health has a program promoting awareness on family planning and other health related matters. 
In terms of major sports facilities and gymnastic halls, Primary and JSS schools do not have access to this kind of infrastructure. Some Church SSS have basketball and volleyball courts. PE (Physical Education) curriculum is taught in Year 10 and 11 only and focuses only on field athletics such as long and short distance running, discus, shot put, high jumps and long jumps.  The capital island has only three public fields and three public basketball/tennis courts. Through collaboration with church schools increased play grounds for public use of the soccer fields, basketball and volleyball grounds after school hours has improved overall participation rate, although this is difficult to verify without detailed data.   
WASH in Schools 
With the endorsement of the national WASH in Schools policy, the government has committed itself to ensure a minimum level of water, sanitation and hygiene standards in all schools. The following measures are examples of the implementation of this policy: 
\0xEF Under WASH in Schools, the MoE has undertaken to enhance education around Menstrual Hygiene Management (MHM) as part of the curriculum and out-of-school activities. After a MHM study that provided better insight in the challenges girls face at school, the government has committed itself to improve the environment for girls in schools. 
\0xEF Through the financial support of the New Zealand aid programme and technical support from UNICEF, the Ministry of Education and school communities have successfully implemented WASH in Schools program in 32 participating schools in 4 targeted islands of Abaiang, Maiana, Marakei and North Tarawa (all PS, JSS/SSS); upgrading their water, sanitation and hygiene standards to provide a better learning environment for students.  
\0xEF UNICEF through MoE has provided support to 9 schools in Butaritari (7-PS, 1-JSS, 1-SSS) in terms of improving their WASH facilities.  UNICEF has also provided a WASH Education Tool Kit for teachers as their reference in providing WASH education to their students.  
Learning and Life Skills for Young People and Adults 
Kiribati has four tertiary institutions. These include the Kiribati institute of Technology (KIT), Marine Training Centre (MTC), Kiribati Teachers College (KTC) and the University of South Pacific (USP). Tertiary institutions have an intake of approximately 25% of school leavers per year. This is below the Governmentis target level despite the construction of new classrooms at both KIT and MTC by the Governments of Australia and New Zealand. In keeping with the spirit of inclusiveness, the KV20 has set the ambitious target of 4 vocational training centres in the outer islands by 2019 (up from 1 currently) and 23 by 2036, which will increase the TVET graduates from the outer islands to 160 by 2019, and to 8800 by 2036. The KV20 also aims to improve access to vocational training in tourism and fisheries related skills as well as cross-cutting technical courses that would support those sectors.  
Kiribati Institute of Technology 
The Ministry of Employment and Human Resource Development (MEHR) reports that KIT is consulting with businesses and industry about their skill needs in an attempt to better align course offerings. This has led to increased courses in carpentry, automotive skills, electrical technology, accounting and business. Notably, female students exceed the number of male students in every year, particularly in the field of business, community services, accounting, and nursing.

The Skills for Employment Program (previously the Kiribati Technical Vocational Education and Training Sector Strengthening Program) is an Australian funded program that aims to develop a more capable, qualified and mobile I-Kiribati workforce. It includes new initiatives to increase the quality and relevance of training at KIT to meet local, regional and international labour market demand, and to strengthen pathways to employment. This includes a dedicated Employment Support Services unit, work placements, partnerships with Group Training Organisations, and a vocational pathway bridging program to reach young people disengaged from the education system.  Other initiatives aim to broaden access to other disadvantaged groups, including people living with a disability and young mothers.  
With essential Australian Government financial and technical support, KIT achieved registration under the Pacific Quality Framework (PQF) in 2018. This framework provides an alternative option for KIT to design and develop programs to meet differing student pathways.  
The KIT has invested heavily in developing a strong and positive brand within the Kiribati community.  This has resulted in KIT being recognized as a high quality TVET institution, allowing KIT graduates to receive preferred employment opportunities from local and international companies operating in Kiribati.  A key strength of KIT is its ability to offer international standard TVET courses through partnership with TAFE South Australia, TAFE Queensland East Coast and Fiji National University.  
However, poor access to the outer islands, performance reliability of staff, and the high cost of internet connectivity has impacted negatively on KIT teaching and administration.  Although KIT has achieved significant reforms in workplace behaviour and productivity, the performance of some staff needs to be raised to maintain KITis strong brand attributes and provide the necessary mentoring for KIT students and graduates. 
The Marine Training Centre 
MTC has been training I-Kiribati since 1967 as seafarers, fishermen and hospitality workers. It has a unique and long-standing relationship to German shipowners resulting in employment rates up to 95%. Since 1967 more than 5,000 I-Kiribati have been trained as seafarers, and in 2017, approximately 1,000 I-Kiribati worked as seafarers or fishers on foreign ships. In 2017, there were around 2,880 students enrolled across 155 courses. 
New Zealand has been supporting MTC for decades and made significant investments into MTCis infrastructure. The recent programme is the Institutional Strengthening Project - Phase IV. Phase IV aims to: 
\0xEF Train I-Kiribati to be qualified and sought after. Graduates find employment consistent with Kiribati's Labour Migration Policy and are able to provide remittances. 
\0xEF Maintain MTC's status as well-managed, credible, responsive and relevant tertiary institution in Kiribati. 
MTC is continuously updating and expanding its courses to meet employers' demands and expectations. As the KV20 focuses on fisheries and tourism, MTC will be a key part in training the workforce needed. 
However, MTC does face challenges in attracting suitable applicants. Many graduates from secondary schools have difficulties in communicating in English confidently and have difficulties understanding simple scientific or mathematical tasks. Furthermore, MTC struggles to fill senior posts: there is a significant lack of experienced marine officer's and engineers, as well as English teachers in Kiribati. Without qualified staff, the training programs at MTC become extremely difficult to implement and will require ongoing technical support. 
Scholarships and Public Service capacity development 
Given the role of the public sector as the main employer in Kiribati, the Public Service Office (PSO) plays an important role in providing education and capacity support. The PSO does this through providing pre-service and in-service scholarships, and in-country and overseas short-courses, as well as providing whole-of-government oversight for HR, governance, and customer service delivery. 
The National Human Resources Planning Committee, with representatives from Government and NGO stakeholders, recommend to Cabinet a list of priority areas for pre-service and in-service training each year.  For the period 2016-2019, the priority areas are selected based on workforce skill gaps in the key areas of the KDP and KV20.   
The Scholarship Board of the Ministry of Education, guided by the list of priority areas, allocates scholarship awards for the Open and Pre-Service categories based on merit. 
School graduates seeking a higher education need to qualify for entry into the University of the South Pacific or the Australia Pacific Technical College; scholarship selection is entirely based on merit. Pathways to technical and further education and higher education are only possible in Kiribati for Year 12 and Year 13 school graduates. This results in a large pool of 15-24 year-olds seeking formal or informal sector employment when they are unable to progress to further study.  
Table 5.6 clearly shows that female participation in scholarship programs generally exceeds that of males by around 50% over the past five years. In 2018 there are 16 male and 23 female new and ongoing students for the public service scholarships.

In 2018, the key areas of priority are: 
\0xEF Tourism and related disciplines (shipping, airline, cultural, IT & ICT);  
\0xEF Fisheries/Applied Science;  
\0xEF Anti-corruption/Good Governance and related fields including economics, finance, taxation, accounting, auditing, law, business administration and commerce;  
\0xEF Engineering;  
\0xEF Education/HR/Admin/International Relations, Community Services/Gender/Investigation; Environment; and 
\0xEF Journalism.  
With relation to Academic training, Bacheloris Degree/Diploma are for pre-service continuing students whilst Masters and higher qualifications are for mature and in-service training. The Government also plans to offer limited PhD scholarships in areas of critical need.  
In terms of In-service scholarships for civil servants, Taiwan has significantly contributed in this area while the Australian and New Zealand government have continuously provided significant scholarship support through open category scholarships. For example, between 2015 and 2018, the Australian Government provided 136 tertiary scholarships and the New Zealand Government provided 80. The New Zealand and Australian scholarships include pre-service, in-service and eligible applications from members of the public. All scholarship programs contribute to developing capacity of our human capital. Other scholarship awards (including other short-term training) with other bilateral donors are pursued in the countries offering the relevant awards.  
The PSO is also currently undertaking its HR transformation process to strategically align its HR policies and functions with the KV20 aspirations.  Since 2017, more investment has been made to have training programs (referred to as \0xEBtargetedi trainings) be delivered more cost-effectively in-country and which the New Zealand Government has provided financial support (including the ongoing Reimbursement Scheme). This approach has involved building partnerships with training providers and institutions to deliver training programs in-country, rather than abroad. The HR development strategy will also include a Competency Framework to assist in identifying competency gaps which may require specialized/professional training (rather than just academic).

KPA 2: Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction SDG Goal 1: End poverty in all forms everywhere 
 
As a small island state with a dispersed population, the costs of service delivery and basic infrastructure can be prohibitive, presenting major impediments to poverty alleviation. In this context, the KV20 and KDP both outline that expenditures should prudently provide the necessary resources and infrastructure to achieve sustainable economic growth. Recognising the cross-cutting nature of poverty reduction efforts, from improving access to health and education services through to providing employment opportunities and basic infrastructure, this section of the Review will discuss only the incidence of poverty in Kiribati. As the most recent poverty data for Kiribati is from the 2006 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES), the effectiveness of recent poverty reduction measures will need to be discussed in the next Voluntary National Review. 
There is no direct translation for the word \0xEBpovertyi in Kiribati. The Kiribati Participatory Poverty Assessment in 2007 found that I-Kiribati communities considered that there were very few people who \0xEBhad nothingi (te kain nano ni kannano). This local definition of poverty is broadly similar to food poverty, something that is relatively rare in Kiribati, at around 5 per cent of the population in 2006 (based on national poverty lines). In the same study, having access to only traditional food was seen as hardship (te maiu ni kanganga), which aligns to the notion of experiencing difficulties in providing for basic family needs. By this broader measure of basic needs poverty, the incidence of poverty is much higher at around 21.8 percent of the population. 
With a Gini coefficient of 0.39, the degree of inequality in Kiribati was found to be similar to that in other Pacific Islands, but poverty rates varied significantly across the different island groups. These differences are driven by available economic opportunities, the extent of isolation, access to subsistence agriculture and fisheries, and the age structure of the population. The highest rates of poverty in 2006 were found in the Southern Gilbert Islands, where 16 percent of the population were found to be below the food poverty line reflecting isolation, limited agricultural potential, and vulnerability to drought. These islands also had the highest incidence of basic needs poverty with 29 percent of households falling into this category.  From a demographic point of view, these islands had the highest proportion of elderly people in the country, and therefore experienced a high dependency ratio. In contrast, poverty rates were very low in the Line Islands, reflecting a younger migrant population and more abundant natural resources.  
Female- and elderly-headed households were over-represented in the poorest 20 percent of households, and children were also more likely to experience poverty. A large proportion of the population was also found to be vulnerable to falling into poverty: if the basic needs poverty line were 20 percent higher, the national poverty rate would have been 34 percent.  
While there is no data to indicate trends in household income growth since the 2006 HIES, real GDP per capita declined by just over 10 percent between 2006 and 2011, before rising again to return to its 2006 level by 2016. This suggests that while there may have been recent gains in overall GDP, average household incomes may not have grown by as much due to increases in population. If this is the case, then poverty rates may not have improved markedly over this period. 
Perhaps surprisingly, the urban capital of South Tarawa had the second-highest incidence of basic needs poverty, with 17 percent of households struggling to provide for themselves. As South Tarawa contains the largest population, this means that the majority of the poor households in Kiribati are located in the capital.  
For South Tarawa, the pressures of overcrowding and climate change on the environment have meant a relative decline in the ability of the population to supplement their incomes with subsistence activities. While the availability of paid employment in the public service is overwhelmingly concentrated on South Tarawa, unemployment remains high, and the greater reliance on the cash economy means that a larger number of households cannot meet their basic needs through subsistence. In general, households in Tarawa tend to be larger (7 people compared to 5 in the outer islands), have higher incomes from wages and remittances, and have better access to public services (like health and education). However, these households also tend to have less access to land, have poorer health from water, sanitation and overcrowding issues, and have less alternative food options.  
The continued trend of urbanisation will further increase these pressures. Between 2010 and 2015, the population of South Tarawa grew by 12.4 percent, far higher than the 1.6 percent population growth experienced in the rest of the country (total population growth was 6.9 percent over the same period).  
Recognising the unsustainable trend of rapid urbanisation, the current Government expanded the Copra price guarantee on the outer islands to $2 per kilogram, well above the market price. This is aimed at creating a cash incentive for those living in the outer islands (or those in South Tarawa without regular income) to move or stay in rural areas. Anecdotally, this policy seems to have slowed the urban drift, but it will be difficult to show this statistically until the next Census in 2020. The geographical inequalities in Kiribati are discussed further in SDG 10 (Inequality). 

SDG Goal 2: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture 
 
Outright hunger is not prevalent in Kiribati, and Kiribatiis biggest challenge is poor nutrition as a major issue.  Health records show increases in incidence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), lifestyle diseases, nutritionally-related diseases (such as vitamin A deficiency and anaemia among children), diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and certain cancers among adults. Along with overweight, under nutrition in children remains a significant public health issue with almost one quarter of young children five years of age or less recorded severely/underweight. Kiribati has developed a national food and nutrition security policy to respond to the resulting health issues and aiming to empower individuals and communities to build and sustain food and nutrition security throughout our nation.  The policy encourages a multi-sector partnership approach with key relevant ministries and organizations. 
Food and nutrition security underpins all development.  With limited land, poor soils and harsh climate conditions, Government efforts are directed at improving traditional crops to withstand the Kiribati climatic conditions, such as coconut, bwabwai (swamp taro), breadfruit and pandanus.  Working with NGOs and donor partners, there are efforts to introduce other fruit trees, vegetables, and root crops. Recent efforts have promoted small-scale home gardening for domestic consumption as well as for local markets in Tarawa, with some success. 
Accessibility of household to food crops and livestock is estimated to be a key vulnerability indicator for each islandsi food security.  A recent survey showed a decline in food availability and variety between the 2010 and 2015 Census periods, with an associated increase in the consumption of imported food.  Southern Kiribati islands have harsher climatic conditions and thus have less varieties of crops and the worst accessibility.    
Livestock accessibility for most islands fare better than food crops.  Livestock are mainly pigs and chickens, with pigs proving to be highly valuable for family special occasions and community, church and island functions.  They are also a profitable source of income.

Food security is also a Climate Change issue.  The Kiribati Joint Implementation Plan (KJIP) for climate action identifies the need for \0xEBincreasing water and food security with integrated and sector-specific approaches and promoting healthy and resilient ecosystemsi.  The sensitivity analysis of climate change on fisheries and food security notes that the \0xEBproductivity for coral reef fish and invertebrates [may] decline by 20% by 2050 due to both the direct effects (sea surface temperature) and indirect effects (changes to fish habitats).i  Observed and potential impacts on agriculture and food security notes \0xEBincreasing risks that the sea will overtop parts or even whole islands, causing salination of some fresh groundwater, destruction of infrastructure, and the death of crops and livestocki.  
Projects that are geared to addressing food security issues in relation to climate change impacts: 
I. The Government of Kiribati project \0xECEnhancing national food security in the context of global climate change is an on-going project based in the Environment and Conservation Division of MELAD.  The project will address both agriculture and fisheries food security issues with an overall objective of \0xECbuilding the adaptive capacity of vulnerable Kiribati Communities to ensure food security under conditions of climate change.  The project also supports the island people to \0xECprosper through a thriving environment and strong cultural values. All project activities will target the reduction of food security issues by setting in place capacities required for local communities to maintain and enhance ecosystem integrity, as established in the National Guidelines for Ecosystem-based Adaptation Management. 
II. The Agriculture and Livestock Division of MELAD strategic plan for KDP 2016-19 emphasizes the development goal of achieving a food and nutritionally secured nation through the key outputs of \0xECimproving production systems, boarder control services, community mobilization and partnership with relevant stakeholders in agricultural value chain to promote synergy and collaboration.  Most of the agricultural development efforts are funded under Governmentis recurrent budget.   
III. External funding support and partnerships with Government assist capacity to achieve development goals.  These include GEF-LDCF Project for food security in the face of climate change in four islands: Maiana, Nonouti, Abemama and North Tarawa.  
IV. The Taiwan Technical Mission (TTM) is supporting home gardening and animal (pig) farming through training and provision of planting materials which are usually vegetables and piglets to all the 33 islands.  
V. The IFAD Kiribati Outer Island Food and Water Project (KOIFAWP) aims to promote the Kiribati local and nutritious food through home gardening initiatives on Abemama, Nonouti, Tabiteuea North and Beru.  
VI. Japanese Government and Germany (GIZ) have also been of great assistance in renovating some of the old agricultural structures such as the pig pens and the Animal Health Laboratory. 
The Government is also targeting the distribution of resilient and high yield varieties of coconut, root and tuber crops, as well as establishing island, school, and community nurseries and gene-banks. Outreach programs are a regular routine work of the Agriculture Division of MELAD, promoting and training farmers sustainable cultivation methods to avoid further deterioration in the fragile make-up of the islands. Safeguarding Kiribati from invasive and harmful pests and diseases is a continuous activity of Biosecurity while ensuring trade is facilitated. 
Agriculture activity in Abaiang is a good case to illustrates increasing interest by locals to grow more variety of root crops, vegetables and improve cultivation methods.  Abaiang has the most variety of food crops and livestock compared to the rest of other outer islands.   
Box 5.2 Summary of Intervieweesi Perceptions on Agriculture - Climate Change Related Issues In Abaiang 
1. Islanders would need more assistance on agriculture in terms of agricultural tools, seeds, improved pig breeds and chickens 
2. Three villages namely Tuarabu, Takarano and Tabontebike were selected as pilot sites for the climate change-agriculture project. Each village has completed work on construction of a pig pen and chicken shed. There is also a land plot selected by villagers that serves as a gene bank for growing local tree crops for food security purpose. Pigs and chickens of improved breeds were also provided to project villages 
3. People are growing a lot of kumara on the whole island. Some villages like Ewena are practicing agro-forestry system where they grow many different types of tree crops like coconut, breadfruits, fig tree (te bero), banana, etc., on one piece of land. The villagers compete among themselves for the prizes and the result is announced during the village \0xEBmaneabai anniversary at the beginning of every year 
4. Most of the produce, like pumpkin, cabbage, tomato, capsicum, etc., are sent to the capital, Tarawa for marketing purpose. On some occasions, a small quantity of these are also sold locally on the island 
5. On-going agriculture related projects are the USAID-GIZ-SPC climate change, Soil Health (ACIAR funded) and organic certification of coconuts 6. 	The major need for cash is to meet the payment of childrenis school fees on a term basis (a 3-months period) 
 
The KOIFAWP project has also shown success in boosting agricultural production and consumption of nutritional local foods on 4 pilot islands (Tab North, Abemama, Beru and Nonouti). Targets set for the project had been progressively well achieved. One activity under the project is the distribution of agricultural hand tools to support farming communities.  During the planned second phase of the project another set of 5-6 islands are to be covered in this food security program. 
Trialling of composting mix to improve soil health is also another component of the KOIFAWP jointly implemented by MELAD, ACIAR, and SPC. MELAD is also trying to equip all the islands with efficient water pumping system as part of its strategy to improve agricultural production in the Outer islands. 
The Taiwan Technical Mission (TTM) agricultural support program assists communities by providing training and material support (seeds, seedlings, and piglets).  It also provides training on making balanced cooking recipes that use the locally grown products.  A good number of people have benefited from the technical support of TTM, especially in South Tarawa (where the mission is based).  Other NGO Live and Learn programs also exist to support communities and home gardening.   
There are observable results of the programs of TTM and NGOs in the increase of South Tarawa households getting involved in home gardening and in marketing vegetables and local fruits (cabbage, pawpaw, pumpkin, cucumber, tomatoes and more).  Although volumes are still too small to have a widespread impact on overall health and nutrition outcomes, there is evidence of small changes in attitudes towards gardening and healthy eating. 
Outside of imported foodstuff and limited local agriculture, fish and marine food sources make up the vast bulk of the Kiribati diet. As Kiribatiis largest natural resource, marine-sourced food will always form an important pillar for food security. 
The Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resourcesi (MFMRD) strategic plan 2016-19 envisions working towards the maximization of economic growth and economic opportunities, enhancement of food security, and sustainable livelihood through sustainable fisheries.  An inclusive approach to community empowerment and effective participation of the private sector is emphasized as essential for informed decision making.  
The Government is committed to ensure the safety of fish for human consumption, monitoring activities to manage fish and shellfish resources, new fish culture trials in outer island waters (Abaiang, North Tarawa), and establishment of marine protected areas in South Tarawa (Nanikai-Teaoraereke) using local approaches (maebono) as a trial.  Other initiatives include trials of 
seaweed and milkfish integrated farming, water and shellfish monitoring, creel survey for fishermen and fish sellers (reef fish), ciguatera monitoring on South Tarawa, translocation of \0xEBte buni (anadara), fishing centre solar power installation in the outer islands, and the monitoring of Sandfish in North Tarawa.  The on-going Observer Program on overseas fishing vessels provides a source of employment and helps sustainability and conservation efforts by ensuring that foreign fishing fleets are abiding by the Fisheries Act. 
Together these measures are all aimed at improving the ability of local I-Kiribati to sustainably utilise the coastal and near-shore marine resources to meet their dietary and economic needs. 
 	 


SDG Goal 8: Promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment, and decent work for all 
 
Kiribati is one of the smallest, most remote and most geographically dispersed countries in the world, which creates significant economic growth and service delivery challenges. Private sector development opportunities are highly constrained by the lack of economies of scale possible in such a small and fragmented domestic market that is extremely remote from large markets abroad. Severe infrastructure deficits in the areas of utilities, transport and communications compound these constraints.  
Economic activity is driven by subsistence fisheries and copra (which is subsidized by the Government), the public sector (including state-owned enterprises (SOEs)), and a service economy underpinned by the public sector in the capital of South Tarawa (where approximately half the population live). Public expenditure was equivalent to 112 percent of GDP in 2016, funded primarily by fisheries license fees (65 percent of GDP) and grants from development partners (33 percent of GDP). The Kiribati Government directly accounts for as much as 50 percent of GDP and some 80 percent of formal sector jobs (however, formal sector employment accounts for only 20 percent of the labour force).  
Beyond subsistence agriculture and fisheries, the private sector remains small, mostly consisting of small firms in the wholesale, retail, and transport sectors. The most significant opportunities for private sector development exist in the fisheries sector, with potential opportunities also in tourism. Open unemployment is estimated to exceed 30 percent, and youth unemployment is around 50 percent. 
The KV20 and KDP 2016-19 place a high premium on a stable macroeconomic environment as a key platform for addressing poverty issues and creating jobs, as the poor are disproportionately affected by periods of economic downturn or inflation. Achieving macroeconomic stability will, however, require the implementation of the fiscal measures to accelerate macro-economic stability for long term sustainable development, and continue the improved performance and reform of SOEs.  
The KV20 has targeted the largest economic driver of the country n fisheries n and biggest potential growth industry of tourism. The KV20 also places a high priority on infrastructure and social sectors (health and education), as well as trade and private sector development. The Vision will work towards improving the GDP growth rate to 5% in 2019 and 10% by 2036. 
Kiribati Recent Economic Performance  
While economic growth has generally been low and volatile, with real per capita GDP falling between 2007 and 2010. The dramatic increase in fisheries licence revenues from 2011 through to 2015 noticeably improved growth outcomes, with real per capita GDP improving by around 13% over the period.  
After 10.3% growth in 2015 real GDP growth declined to 1.1% in 2016, due in large part to the completion of major capital works and a decline in fishing revenue from the record highs in 2015. Real GDP growth in 2016 was driven by agriculture and fishing, wholesale and retail trade, and construction, although this improvement was somewhat offset by government spending to support the copra price scheme.

The Government acts as the main distribution mechanism for the national fisheries revenue and, together with development partner programs, the Government fiscal position is a key determinant of total economic activity.  
For example, fisheries revenue in 2011 was $29.1 million, but by 2015 this had risen to $197.7 million. While fishing revenue fell to $147.1 million in 2016, the significant increase in total revenue has meant that the Government can more actively engage in development activities that can target growth. In particular, this has enabled the Government to invest in major capital works and transfer programs (like the copra subsidy), which have supported the construction industry, wholesale, and retail trade. Despite a large increase in public expenditures to support growth (total Government funded expenditure was $174.4 million in 2016, up from $100.2 million in 2011), the conservative bias in estimating volatile fishing revenues has meant a continued budget surplus (the surplus was $33.7 million in 2016). 
Significant fiscal surpluses since 2014 have enabled the Government to accumulate fiscal buffers and repair the Kiribati sovereign wealth fund: the Revenue Equalisation Reserve Fund (RERF), which reached $968.1 million by May 2018. As a small island economy that is exposed to both financial and climate risks, these buffers are a crucial component of managing economic and fiscal shocks. Previously, the RERF was used to simply balance the Budget when fishing revenues were below the estimates. However, given the significant fiscal buffers that have been accumulated the KV20 lays out a plan to reform the RERF into an endowment fund for all generations of I-Kiribati and is targeting a RERF balance of $1 billion by 2020 (a target that is well on track). The current cash reserves and a conservative bias in fishing revenue estimates will replace the RERF in the revenue equalisation role and support overall macro-stability. 
Box 5.3 The Economic Reform Taskforce 
The Economic Reform Taskforce (ERT) is made up of Government of Kiribati representatives and those development partners who are engaged with Budget Support operations. In 2017, these partners were the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, New Zealand, and Australia. The objective of the ERT is to: (i) strengthen public financial management; and (ii) improve the environment for inclusive growth. The ERT decides on a joint matrix of reform activity that is supported by all parties. 
The first pillar of the ERT reforms is in public financial management (PFM) and focuses on strengthening the primary functions of the PFM system, such as public procurement, accounting, fiscal policy, and cash management. Over time, and in conjunction with other measures, these reform actions should contribute to wider improvements in the maintenance of fiscal sustainability, the containment of fiscal risks, and the quality of public spending.  
The second pillar, is improving the management of public assets and liabilities, which relates mainly to reforms of the RERF, debt reporting, and asset management.  
Finally, the environment for inclusive growth pillar, focuses on improving oversight of joint ventures in the fisheries industry, improving the quality and expanding the coverage of essential public utilities, facilitating competition and universal service provision in the telecommunications industry, and reforming SOEs.  
Together with setting up the Budget Support triggers, the reform program also focuses development partner technical assistance programs in areas of joint priority. The ERT is a joint process and is guided by the Kiribati development plans.  
The ERT has been a key driver in major economic and fiscal reforms in Kiribati including the successful SOE reform program, the management and investment reforms to the RERF (which have lowered management costs from $1.5m per year in 2013 to $0.7m in 2017, as well as seen dramatic improvements in investment performance), the review and reform of the national procurement system, the introduction of annual reviews of fisheries joint-ventures, improved financial reporting, and the planned introduction of an Integrated Financial Management Information System. 
The SOE reforms have been particularly successful, with a reduction in the number of SOEs from 22 to 14 since the passage of the SOE Act in 2013. The Act included the introduction of Government Community Service Obligation (CSO) payments to SOEs who are requested to provide non-commercial services to the public.  
The sale of the Government retailer and wholesalers (The Kiribati Supply Company and Bobotin Kiribati) and the public telecommunications company (Telecommunication Service Kiribati) has opened up the private sector in these areas, with improved services and jobs growth for the community. This is in addition to the institutional reforms at the Public Utilities Board (PUB), which have enabled reliable electricity and water services on South Tarawa. Overall, the reforms have played a large role in improving the profitability of the SOE portfolio from total losses of $1.8m in 2009, to total profits of $11.6m in 2016). 
 
Prices and Inflation 
After a large increase in fuel prices in 2008-09, inflationary pressure has been low, with inflation averaging -0.2% since 2010. Annual inflation for 2017 was just 0.4%. The major increases for 2017 were a 19.9% increase in the prices of Non-Alcoholic Drinks (contributing 2.2 percentage points to inflation) and a 5.2% increase in Alcohol and Tobacco (contributing 1.0 percentage points). These increases were partially offset by a 24.3% fall in Utility prices (decreasing inflation by 1.2 percentage points) and a 2.1% fall in Food prices (decreasing inflation by 0.9 percentage points).

Trade and income transfers 
Like most small island states, Kiribati runs a large goods deficit with the rest of the world, driven largely by the need to import a large portion of its food and almost all of its retail and capital goods from overseas. Exports have traditionally been mainly coconut products and fish.  Kiribati is highly reliant on imports of foodstuffs.  Exports in 2016 rose by 6.2% to $14.1 million, and imports grew 7.2% to be $147.4m. This resulted in a goods trade deficit of $133.3m.   
The growth in exports was driven by unrefined copra export (up by $1.4m), crude coconut oil (up by $1.1m) among other smaller increases, which collectively outweighed a $2.5m decline in fish exports. For imports, the main increases were in Food (up by $10.3m), Beverages and Tobacco (up by $7.8m), and Crude Materials (up by $3.5m), with a decline in Machinery and Transport (down by $8.7m) and Manufactured Goods (down by $4.4m).

However, in terms of national income, the current account is in surplus, driven largely by fishing licence revenues. In 2016 for example, the $147.1 million in licence revenues far exceeded the $133.3 million deficit on the goods trade. 
In terms of income to households, remittances from seamen in the past have been a large source of income from abroad.  However, since the Global Financial Crisis, the number of seamen employed overseas has steadily declined to 855 at the end of 2015.  Economic conditions, changes in vessel technology (where ships have become larger), and increased competition from Asian nationsi have contributed to this decline.  Seamenis remittances were $7.6 million at the end of 2016, an increase from the $5.3 million in 2014, but below the peak of $12.5 million in 2002.  Despite the recent growth, there are ongoing concerns surrounding international shipping volumes and the demand for seafarers. 
Figure 5.7 Seamenis Remittances, 2000-2015 
  
Further opportunities for overseas employment such as seasonal workersi schemes in New Zealand and Australia have recently expanded, providing alternatives to traditional maritime sector employment.  The White Paper on Northern Australian development opens further potential for low skilled I-Kiribati for future work in Australia.   
Promoting Inclusive Trade and Private Sector for Sustainable Development 
While the private sector is small in relation to the public sector, private sector formal employment has increased significantly since 2010. The number of private sector contributors to the Kiribati Provident Fund (KPF) has increased from 2,087 in June 2010 to 4,005 in June 2016, a rise of 92.0%. Over the same period, the number of public sector contributors increased by just 1.9%. Figure 5.8 Public and Private Sector KPF Contributors, Kiribati, 2009-2016 

Source: KPF 
Dominant industries for employment continue to be in the Agriculture/Fisheries, Retail/Sales and Manufacturing sectors (Table 5.10). While there has been a significant increase in observable construction activity in Kiribati over the past 5 years, the construction industry comprises just 3% of jobs in 2015. According to KPF data 60% of all registered businesses with documented employees are in the retail/sales sector.

While the private sector has experienced some recent growth, the majority of the businesses are mainly based on the urban islands of Tarawa and Kiritimati. The total number of registered businesses in South Tarawa and Kiritimati are 2642 and 232 respectively, in contrast to the Other Outer Islands which has less than 100 registered businesses. 
In order to support the development of the private sector, the government adopted Trade Policy Framework (TPF) in December 2017 to guide its private sector and trade development agenda. In the context of the foreign trade policy, Kiribati signed PACER Plus trade agreement in June 2017 and will be considering the accession to the Interim Economic Partnership Agreement (I-EPA) to support fish exports to the EU market. Kiribati also recently acceded to Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works and acceded to Marrakesh Treaty; to facilitate access to cultural materials especially for the visually impaired. In order to facilitate better trade links, Kiribati has also adopted a National Quality Policy to strengthen the national quality infrastructure and the National intellectual property Strategy to improve the intellectual property regime. Kiribati is in the process of enacting a new copyright legislation to support the development of the cultural capital as envisaged in the KV20.  
Developing an inclusive private sector will also require investment to support the development of private sector on the outer Islands, which have dismally performed in terms of business development. Although foreign investment can be a good ingredient to private sector development to the economy, only 18 foreign investors have established their enterprises in Kiribati. To address this challenge, a new Foreign Investment legislation is being enacted to streamline investment application and administration regime. The government is also in the process of reviewing company law and business registration systems. 
 
Government has made a number of policy commitments to achieve KDP and SDG targets for inclusive growth and employment: 
I. In compliance with the international commitments of Government to the Convention of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), there is a new policy in development for persons living with disability which aims to protect and safeguard their interests and inclusivity.   
II. A new (draft) National Youth Policy 2017 of Government aims to ensure all youth inclusively are developed to contribute effectively to nation development through sports, culture-based arts (local dancing etc.), emerging (entertainment) talents, volunteer youth work, and employment. 
III. A draft Gender Equality and Women Development Policy is in final stages of development and approval, addressing women and children needs for safe environments, womensi economic empowerment, and increased participation in leadership and decision making. The National Conditions of Service recognises maternity leave entitlements and breastfeeding.   
IV. A TVET Strategy aims to improve national economic growth and increasing employment opportunities for I-Kiribati at home and abroad, especially young women and men through appropriate tailor-made training courses and demand-driven programs offered at an internationally compatible standard. 
V. Increased recruitment of quality candidates for seasonal workers schemes and the Pacific Labour Scheme.  
VI. The Employment and Industrial Relations Code makes provision for the regulation of employment contracts; industrial relations; the settlement of employment disputes; for matters concerning work conditions, wages, decent work for inclusiveness, and to work in conditions of freedom, equity, security and human dignity; and in the interest of employers to safeguard against penalties. 
VII. Government, with assistance of Taiwan, continues to provide small grants to communities to start up small businesses helping mostly women to be economically empowered.  The grant is also accessible to people and communities in urban and rural areas affected by severe storms and sea surges, to help them recover and to build sea-walls.  A budget of $1m is available annually for this support. 
 	 
 
SDG Goal 10: Reduce inequality 
 
As gender inequality is covered under SDG 5 and Kiribati does not have sizeable minority populations, this section will focus more on the regional inequality experienced in Kiribati. The distribution of poverty is covered under SDG 1. 
In Kiribati all people have access to hereditary lands and have free access to the sea for food and for economic needs, although urbanisation and poor environmental practices (particularly in South Tarawa) have degraded their ability to do so. Income inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, was 0.39 in 2006 n broadly similar to other Pacific nations.  
The varying quality of services offered between island groups and the capital of Tarawa is a particular issue for the Government n especially for services like health care and higher education.  Economic and business opportunities, accessibility to government and donor funded programs, and public service employment also tend to support those living on the urban island of South Tarawa and Kiritimati.  However, less population pressure on the outer islands has been shown to support lower overall poverty rates when compared to South Tarawa (as discussed under SDG1). 
With high transport costs and small cash economies, the outer islands in Kiribati are some of the most difficult places in the world to deliver basic goods and services. The Government has attempted to address this challenge by increasing the price-floor on publicly purchased copra to $2 per kg. This has resulted in a massive cash injection into outer island economies: the copra payments were around $8 million in 2015 but have since risen to an estimated $33 million in 2017.  While a review of the economic impacts of this policy will commence soon, there has been an obvious increase in the purchasing power of outer island communities which will go some way to bridging the gap in incomes between the rural and urban areas.  
The Government also has two freight schemes in place to help address the elevated shipping costs to the outer islands. The first of these is the import levy imposed on all imported goods at the point of entry. This levy then directly subsidises the internal shipping costs for these remote communities in an attempt to lower retail prices to something broadly consistent with South Tarawa (the major port of entry). The second is a fruit and vegetable subsidy that will cover the shipping costs of any fruit and vegetables produced in the outer islands so it can be sold in markets of South Tarawa. This scheme has been somewhat successful in complimenting agricultural efforts on the outer islands, with bananas and other fruits available for purchase in the capital, but shipping volumes remain low. 
In 2018 the Government announced $30 million dollars for phase I of the Outer Islands Infrastructure Project n a parallel effort alongside investments in maritime transport infrastructure by the World Bank and ADB. These efforts compliment a growing portfolio of capital investments in the outer islands that are aimed at improving service delivery to the most remote communities in Kiribati. This is a key focus under KPA6. 
Box 5.4 The Line and Phoenix Islands Integrated Development Strategy (LPIDS) 2016-2026 
The Line and Phoenix Islands are located in the eastern \0xECtropical convergence zone of the south central Pacific, with the administrative capital of Kiritimati being more than 2000 miles east of Tarawa, some 1600 miles north of Rarotonga, and 1400 miles south of Honolulu, the nearest neighbours. In this context, the Line Islands and particularly the Phoenix Islands are among the most remote place within Kiribati, which is one of the most remote places on earth. With a population of around 10,500 (6,356 of which live on Kiritimati Island), this extreme remoteness has presented its own set of unique challenges within the Kiribati context. 
The LPIDS was the first attempt at linking the 2016-19 KDP to long-term development aspirations. The focus of the strategy is on the Line and Phoenix group of islands, and Kiritimati island in particular. The vision of the plan is: 
\0xECThe people of the Line and Phoenix Islands will enjoy a safe and healthy environment that is resilient to the impacts of Climate Change and that supports productive, enterprise-based livelihoods, human health and sustainable development within a sound governance framework. 
The Strategy is built around the three strategic goals of sustainable, inclusive, and environmentally aware development. Taking a whole-of-island approach, the plan calls for investment of everything from water and energy investments through to developing the hospital and local training facilities. 
The LPIDS is heavily supported by the EU development program.   
 
Other efforts to reduce inequality include: 
\0xEF Policies of the Education sector, for Small Grants, ESGBV, Anti-corruption, project employment, overseas seasonal work, rights of people with disability, health, climate change, and others are discussed in different sections of this report, but all are developed and implemented with the aim of reducing the inequalities within these areas.   
\0xEF Overseas seasonal work programs encourage all islands to be provided a fair share of the available positions, provided that individuals meet the relevant criteria. For example, the selection tests for MTC trainees to work on international ships are inclusively conducted in all islands.   
\0xEF Government has also expanded funding support to all students that qualify for higher forms of education, providing boarding facilities for some students from the outer islands that do not have family members on the islands with Senior Secondary Schools. This is in addition to the Free Education policy and subsidies for school supplies that aim to give all children access to adequate education opportunities regardless of their income level or location. 
\0xEF For dropouts from junior secondary school, both the USP and the KIT have developed vocational programs to provide further opportunities for training and employment, although the outer islands are underserviced.   
\0xEF Improved telecommunications services to the outer islands, including telephony, internet, and the extension of the national radio service to the Line and Phoenix Group.   
\0xEF Expanded air services operated by the Air Kiribati Limited (AKL) in the form of higher capacity domestic airplanes (a Dash 8 aircraft) to meet critical transport needs, as well as the subsidising of non-commercial airlinks in the Line Islands, where vast distances and low population make commercial domestic services unviable.   
\0xEF Government is committed, under international and regional conventions that it is a party to, to reduce inequalities.  For the CEDAW, CRPD, CRC, ILO conventions, Government has developed appropriate laws and policies to implement the conventions.  Although a number of these are yet to be reported or reviewed, limited reporting shows that Kiribati has and is making progress in some areas.   
\0xEF The Government has introduced the Kiribati National Youth Policy 2017-2019, Kiribati National Disability Policy 2017-2021 and Gender Equality and Women Development Policy 2017-2019 to promote equality and inclusiveness.   
 	 

 
 
KPA 3: Health 
SDG Goal 3: Ensure Healthy Lives and Promote Well-being for All 
A healthy population is a productive population. Good health is recognised as a pre-requisite to economic growth, poverty reduction and the realization of the KV20, KDP and SDGs. The health challenges for Kiribati are stark and entrenched. These challenges are across both Communicable (CDs) and Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) which remain significant threats to the lives, wellbeing and the productivity of I-Kiribati.  While progress has been made in service delivery, indicators continue to remain unacceptable across a number of areas. 
The recent increase in rates of reported NCDs and nutrition related diseases makes these the leading causes of morbidity.  The prevalence of diabetes in the 2015-16 STEPS Survey was 20.5%. Although data shows new cases of diabetes dropped from 1450 in 2016 to 1100 in 2017, the prevalence of diabetes is still much higher than historical levels pre-2008.   
Figure 5.9 Annual cases of Diabetes 2002-2017 and 4-year moving average 

It is worth noting that a rise in NCDs is likely to impact on life expectancy; with the MHMS Strategic Plan for 2016-19 noting that the NCD incidence could slow down, or even reverse, recent improvements in life expectancy. Adult mortality rate in 2015 was 45.9 and dropped to 43.4 in 2016.   
The urban areas of TUC and BTC, both in South Tarawa, have registered the highest cases of diabetes and hypertension (Figure 5.10), likely reflecting the high availability of convenient, high salt and high sugar foods. As further background, the total number of cases with more than three risk factors in developing NCDs has increased from 79% in 2004-06 to 83.6% in 2015-16.  Tobacco use is also high, with around 67% of adult men and 37% of adult women regular users of tobacco. Figure 5.10 Cases of diabetes and hypertension, 2016 

Source: MHMS 
 
Cases of Communicable Diseases (CDs), associated with overcrowding and poor hygiene, also remain a great challenge to the health and wellbeing of I-Kiribati. Tuberculosis (TB) and Leprosy are the most common cases. Leprosy is highest in South Tarawa, at 17 cases per 10,000 population, when compared to the outer islands (Figure 5.11). 
Figure 5.11 Cases of Leprosy by Island in Kiribati (2010-2015) 

Source: MHMS 
Tuberculosis cases ranged between 366 and 429 per 100,000 population in 2010-2013 with latest data in 2016 showing an increase to 470. A significant number of TB cases are found in the densely populated area of Betio in South Tarawa. Temakin and Takoronga recorded the highest cases of TB with 52 and 64 cases, respectively, while no cases were recorded in Tangintebu and Tebunia (Figure 5.12). Other cases of CDs include outbreaks of diarrhoea, which is generally concentrated among children under five years of age.  
Figure 5.12 Incidence of TB Cases on South Tarawa (2015) 

Source: MHMS 
Maternal and Child health 
While policy measures are being implemented through the Reproductive, Maternal, Neonatal, Child and Adolescence Health (RMNCAH) program, high population growth remains a significant development concern. The total fertility rate remains above three children per woman (TFR of 3.5 in 2017) and there is a high prevalence of STIs, with a study in 2004 showing around 15 percent of pregnant women were infected. At the end of 2010, Kiribati had a cumulative total of 54 HIV/AIDS cases, of which 24 were known to have died.  
However, the primary concern relates to child mortality. A comparative analysis of child mortality measures across the Pacific Island Countries at different age groups shows Kiribati to have the highest under five mortality rate in the Pacific (excluding Papua New Guinea).  
Figure 5.13 Under five, Infant and Neonatal Mortality Rates in the Pacific, 2015 

100,000 live births in 2010 to 151 in 2014, and to 179.3 in 2016. However, annual variation in maternal mortality should be assessed in the context of the volatility that a small number of cases can introduce (for example, four maternal deaths were recorded in 2015). 
Malnutrition is a persistent health concern among children and adults in Kiribati. Malnutrition is a significant risk factor for other conditions, with 38 percent of males and 54 percent of females aged 20 years and over being classified as obese in 2008. At the same time, under-nutrition is a significant problem among children; the 2009 DHS found that close to one quarter of children are underweight or severely underweight. Improvement is occurring however, in 2010 the percentage of new-born infants weighing less than 2500 grams at birth was 22 percent but by 2016 this percentage had dropped to 6.2.  While recent improvements have been seen, improper and inadequate consumption of nutritious diets, and high consumption of foods which are high in fat, sugar, and salt, remain contributing factors to NCD and malnutrition rates.   
The recent graduation from GAVI was supplemented by transitional funding from Australia, with the Government of Kiribati taking up this responsibility in 2018. Immunization is offered to all newborns and infants, but immunization records for children under five-year olds showed a drop in coverage for measles from 89.2% in 2015 to 82.8% in 2016. Recent efforts have improved this 92.2% in 2017.  
Health Institutions - Service Availability and Accessibility 
The health care facilities that are available in Kiribati consist of three different settings: Hospitals (4), Island Health Centers (21) and Village Clinics/ Dispensaries (106).  Visits to households for certain individual health cases are undertaken by health staff, including the distribution of TB and Leprosy medications.  Medical service and medicines are free in Kiribati. 
Medical doctor availability has improved from 4.1 per 10,000 in 2015 to 6.0 per 10,000 in 2017. The total number of available health personnel (which includes medical doctor, dentists, assistants, nurses and midwives) increased from 39 per 10,000 in 2015 to 42 per 10,000 in 2017. The vast majority (71 percent) of medical staff are nurses. 
In terms of health facilities, the New Zealand Government is the major development partner working in the Health infrastructure space. The Tungaru hospital in Tarawa is the main hospital facility in Kiribati, and was originally constructed with the assistance of Japan. 
The 2016-19 MHMS Strategic Plan 
The above health situation confirms the unhealthy position of Kiribati in relation to the rest of the world.  Despite some positive progress, Kiribati remains one of the lowest performers in health indicators among Pacific Island Countries. This is acknowledged in both the KDP (that has set targets and indicators to address the issues) and in the MHMSis Strategic Plan 2016-2019, that concurrently identified six strategic objectives: 
1. Strengthen initiatives to reduce the prevalence of risk factors for NCDs, and to reduce morbidity, disability and mortality from NCDs. 
2. Increase access to and use of high quality, comprehensive family planning services, particularly for vulnerable populations including women whose health and wellbeing will be at risk if they become pregnant. 
3. Improve maternal, newborn and child health. 
4. Prevent the introduction and spread of communicable diseases, strengthen existing control programs and ensure Kiribati is prepared for any future outbreaks. 
5. Address gaps in health service delivery and strengthen the pillars of the health system. 
6. Improve access to high quality and appropriate health care services for victims of genderbased violence, and services that specifically address the needs of youth. 
Maternal and child health were combined into a single objective under the RMNCAH to improve coordination between maternal and child health, reflecting a key area for improvement under the review of Kiribati Child Survival Strategy 2008n2012.   
The sixth objective was identified as a priority issue for the next four years. Strategies relating to gender equality are included in the KDP under KPA 5 on governance, and gender-based violence is considered in the results matrix for this KPA. The needs and health issues of youth are considered in various parts of the KDP including in relation to health (STIs and HIV) and governance (empowerment, involvement and participation).  
The MHMS Strategic Plan 2016-19 emphasizes the importance of relationships, partnerships and intersectoral coordination and collaboration. The Ministry has relationships with key local partners, including other Kiribati government departments and agencies, NGOs, and community-based groups. It also has relationships with numerous bi-lateral and international development partners. The Plan also promotes the use of the Health Sector Coordinating Committee as the main avenue to create dialogue with key partners, share MHMS progress on implementation of priority interventions, monitor spending, and determine needed assistance from development partners  
The Ministry partners with NGOs to execute a number of activities to contribute to achieving goals and targets.  The Kiribati Family Health Association is an active partner of the Ministry and is mandated under its constitution to focus on Family Health and the core function of women health-check services (for cancer).  KFHA operates a mobile check-up and lab service, and does community and outer island outreach programs in this area.  Furthermore, in partnership with the Kiribati Red Cross Society (KRCS) under its WASH, Disaster Management and First Aid programs, significant health improvements have been achieved at the community level. In addition, the Youth Division of MWYSSA, through the RMNCAH program has mobilized youth registered with the Ministry to undertake required basic health surveys, community outreach programs, and more.   
MHMS also partners with Kiribati Community Health Organization (KCHO), a national CSO overarching smaller NGOs and community groups and representing them in higher-level national and international meetings, workshops and conferences. KCHO is an active partner to the MHMS in advocating on health issues and challenges, empowering smaller community groups to understand their roles and cause in health-related interventions, and to create understanding and ownership in various development aspects of the KPAs and SDGs. An initiative from the KCHO to eliminate open defecation is a pilot project to construct WHO and MHMS recommended pit toilets in every household within the community. The project is well supported and co-monitored by the MHMS and UNICEF as part of the national WASH program. UNICEF provided technical assistance and sato pans to provide low cost sanitation options in the communities. 
UNICEF has been a consistent partner and supporter for Kiribati Immunization programs for children, supporting also the Pharmacy, capacity building for nurses, amongst others.  UNICEF has also supported the MHMS and Health Promotion Team in enhancing the water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) standards in the clinics in some islands, as well as rehabilitated 22 WASH facilities. With UNFPA, UN Women, UNDP, and the WHO, MHMS is benefiting from joint programs such as the RMNCAH. Close support by national staff of the UN Agencies at the UN Joint Presence have assisted with project acquittals and reporting and capacity building of project staff in the Ministry. Kiribatiis traditional bilateral donors are New Zealand and Australia, both of whom are actively supporting the MHMS in a wide range of areas alongside significant financial and technical support also being provided from Japan and Taiwan.  
For strengthened coordination of this support, the MHMS brings together donor and ministry/NGO partners to an annual National Health Forum. Through the Health Steering Committee, there have been better and closer working relationships that have enabled more effective monitoring, evaluation, and implementation of the programs supported by the development partners. 
 	 
  
KPA 4: Environment  
SDG Goal 11: Make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable 
 
 
 
Urbanization in Kiribati is an urgent challenge, impacting on government service delivery, access to services and infrastructure, environmental resources, economic opportunities and ultimately peopleis standard of living. The urban population makes up about 57 percent of the total population, with continuing rapid urban growth creating the dual problems of declining working age populations in the outer islands, and strained urban infrastructure and poor environmental conditions in South Tarawa.  
Land on South Tarawa is severely constrained, with limited land area and high population density. The general land use plan is determined by the Central Land Planning Board, which was established under the Land Planning Ordinance. However, private lands are often developed independently of this plan, with large informal settlements on South Tarawa in both public and private spaces.  In contrast, as the Line Group did not have an indigenous population, the land tenure in state lands such as Kiritimati, Tabuaeran and Teraina is governed by the State Lands Act, which combines land tenure with planning requirements for the sustainable use of land resources and leases land to private holders on long or perpetual terms. 
Secure access to land can contribute to social and economic development, and guarantees tenure, which builds more confidence in investors, be they small or large. While improving land use is critical towards sustainable development, land scarcity, squatting, contesting of land ownership titles, and the policy requirements in subleasing Government lands (consent which usually comes at an expensive price to landowners) are major obstacles to private sector development in urban areas, and to a lesser extent, this also impedes the expansion of public services and facilities.    
Weak monitoring, enforcement, and governance challenges relating to land ownership contribute to non-compliance to the general land use plan. This is evident in disorderly development in most areas of South Tarawa and limited land to support commercial activities. Land scarcity, especially for Commercial purposes in South Tarawa, implies that there is need for substantive investment towards land reclamation and creation.  
The Government recognises the need to strengthen land use planning and administration to create transparent and effective procedures for obtaining land for private sector development. In this context, an updated General Land Use Plan (GLUP) for South Tarawa was developed in 2017.  GLUPs will also be developed for Kiritimati, Tabuaera, Teraina and PIPA by the year 2023.  Ongoing efforts are being made to strengthen the national land policy and legislative framework and additional investment will be targeted towards increasing land area designated for residential and commercial purposes. 
With land accreted as a result of the Betio causeway construction in South Tarawa, Government endorsed the Recreational Reserves Act 1996 for public spaces and parks for use by the public in two causeway areas in Betio and Bairiki, as well as other designated parks. While this will increase the amount of public spaces for recreational and community use, these spaces still fall well short of what would ordinarily be expected in a healthy urban environment. 
Due to very high rate of urbanization, Tarawa, Teinainano and Betio (all on South Tarawa atoll) are very densely populated with poor living conditions, overcrowding, and strained waste management infrastructure. Government is pursuing available options including land fill sites for rubbish, new settlement space in Temaiku to ease overcrowding issues in Urban Tarawa, assisted migration to settle on Government owned lands in Kiritimati, Tabuaeran and Teraina, and investing in sanitation and water systems.  De-urbanization considerations are also being pursued with plans to develop the outer islands and improving living standards: improvements of roads, internet and mobile services, improved cash earning in copra cutting (via the Government subsidy scheme), water, education and health services.  
Box 5.5 The Temaiku Project 
The Temaiku Project is an ambitious concept of creating 330 hectares of land on the Temaiku Bight in South Tarawa. The design calls for the infill of the existing land area to a height of two metres above the highest measured sea level, ensuring the safety and security of around 30,000 residents for the next century or more. The creation of usable land will also extend the existing freshwater lens, which will alleviate some of the critical water supply issues on South Tarawa. 
Such an ambitious plan has required widespread engagement with the community and government, and touches on almost every area of public service delivery. With technical support funded by the Government of New Zealand, extensive consultations on the environmental and social impacts have progressed alongside the technical engineering and design work.  
The financing and technical requirements for the land reclamation, enabling infrastructure, private investment, and government reforms are substantial, with existing partner and Government resources requiring significant increases to ensure that the plan for South Tarawa turns into a reality. With population growth and continued climate change, the Temaiku project presents an opportunity for South Tarawa to dramatically improve the wellbeing and safety of its residents. 
 
In addition to urbanisation pressures, the quality of housing in Kiribati is a significant health issue, with poor housing contributing to the spread of communicable and mosquito-borne diseases on South Tarawa (such as dengue fever and chikungunya). The government housing project generously supported by New Zealand aid has dramatically improved and updated some public servant housing by creating more modern dual-storey and medium density suburbs. This program is being rolled out on a continuous basis, but improving private housing remains a challenge with current success being limited to a relatively small pool of public servants. 
In an effort to increase the private funding that is available, The Kiribati Housing Corporation has approved a house-loan scheme to assist people build new and better homes, but low incomes and lack of securitisation limits access. The only bank in Kiribati, ANZ, also offers personal and mortgage lending, as well as provides training and mechanisms to support home owners to better manage their investment.   
In an attempt to consolidate urban planning, a Draft National Urban Policy (NUP) 2017 has been proposed. It consists of seven policy areas: Economy, Governance, Land, Housing, Environment, Social, and Urban Infrastructure (including, Water and Sanitation, Transport, Communication, and Energy). The policy sets a vision for the next 10 years and beyond, identifying key interventions and actions in the short, medium, and long terms. These actions aim at building on existing projects and policies with the NUP convening a review two years after commencement of its implementation (which would be around the time the next KDP is formed). The policy also indicates Kiribatiis strong commitment in the implementation of the New Urban Agenda and the Pacific New Urban Agenda.   

 
SDG Goal 12: Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns 
 
South Tarawa, is home to roughly half of Kiribatiis population of about 107,600.  South Tarawa has two municipal (Island) councils\0xF3 Betio Town Council (BTC) and Teinainano Urban Council (TUC). 
Similar with other small Pacific island countries, Kiribati has a significant waste problem which includes end-of-life vehicles, white goods (refrigerators, freezers, and washing machines), electronic equipment, general household refuse, and plastics.  These wastes and other similar debris are of major concern without proper disposal mechanisms given the limited land space and fragile environment.  To address waste issues, MELAD drafted the National Solid Waste Management Strategy in 2007 with the assistance of SPREP, and also prepared the Kiribati Integrated Environment Policy in 2012.  
There are two landfills established and operated by TUC located in Nanikaai and Bikenibeu, and one landfill in Betio operated by BTC.  All contained wastes are collected by the urban councils, private operators and direct disposal by the public at the landfills.  The Betio landfill is reported to have a remaining capacity of 8,500 cubic meters, while at Bikenibeu and Nanikai, remaining capacity is 32,500 cubic meters and 17,800 cubic meters respectively.  Other smaller dumpsites also exist, but these are illegal under the Environment Act. In addition, Kiritimati Urban Council (KUC) is responsible for solid waste management on Kiritimati Island, including rubbish collection and recycling. 
Kiribatiis most successful recycling initiative has been the Kaoki Maange (Keep Kiribati Beautiful) Program. The recycling system is based on the Kaoki Mange Container Deposit Legislation, operated under contract by a private business, and functions as a recycling system for aluminum cans, PET bottles, and lead-acid batteries. The Special Fund (Waste Materials Recovery) Act 2004 allows for a deposit of A$0.05 to be levied on each beverage container at the point of import, with consumers being able to redeem A$0.04 when returning containers for recycling. The remaining A$0.01 covers handling fees to support recycling operations.  The ministry had also formulated the National Solid Waste Management Strategy in 2007, with the assistance of SPREP and prepared the Kiribati Integrated Environment Policy in 2012.  
A pilot project on collecting non-organic waste in green bags is managed by the Foundation for the Peoples of the South Pacific, Kiribati (FSPK), a nongovernment organization that oversees truck scheduling, public engagement work, and green bag distribution.  
Environment and Conservation Division (ECD) of MELAD plays a key role in public awareness related activities, some donor-funded programs, and enforcing the Environment (Amendment) Act 2007. Local initiatives have provided incentives for cleaner villages, such as the annual \0xECtidy village competitions.  Overall legal, policy, and planning for solid waste management is a national government responsibility which the New Zealand Government is supporting via its solid waste management programs.  	 
  
SDG Goal 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impact 
 
As a result of its inherent characteristics as an atoll nation and a least developed country with a fragile economy and environment, Kiribati is extremely vulnerable to climate change. Kiribatiis has an extremely limited ability to respond to climate change risks, which is exacerbated by its highly vulnerable socio-economic and geographical situation.  Climate change is no longer a future threat, but a daily reality that has already intensified disaster impacts, water shortages and inundation events. The key observed impacts of climate change in Kiribati includes but is not limited to:  
\0xEF Severe coastal erosion as a result of sea level rise 
\0xEF Frequent inundation of coastal areas and entire communities as a result of extreme weather events, storm surges and sea level rise. 
\0xEF Changing weather and climatic patterns resulting in extremely long dry periods and droughts. 
\0xEF Contamination and salination of water resources from inundation during frequent spring tides. 
\0xEF Increasing incidence of water-borne and vector-borne diseases undermining water and food security, and the livelihoods and basic needs of the population 
As a result of the climate challenges facing our country and our people, the government of Kiribati is already taking bold steps to address this calamity.  
Climate Change policy  
In light of the impacts of climate change and related disasters risks, a National Climate Change Policy has been developed to safeguard the future existence of Kiribati as a sovereign nation: her people, culture, environment, development progress, and aspirations. 
The key objectives of the policy intend to address issues relating to:  
i) 	Coastal protection and climate proofing infrastructure,  ii) 	Food Security,  iii) 	Water Security,  iv) 	Energy Security,  v) 	Environment,  
vi) 	Sustainability,  vii) 	Health Security,  viii) 	Disaster Risk Management,  
ix) 	Unavoidable Climate Change Impacts/ loss and damage,  x) 	Capacity Building and Education, and xi) 	Climate Change financing. 
For Kiribati, climate change is no longer just an environmental issue, but one that transcends all areas of government and our society. With this realization, the government of Kiribati has entrusted the portfolio of climate change management to the Office of Te Beretienti (OB) and MELAD with the aim of ensuring a well-coordinated, whole-of-government and country approach and response to this issue. 
a. 	Whole of Island Approach  
Instead of focusing on only selected villages or single sectors, the Whole of Island Approach targets the whole island ecosystem, communities, and governance structures, whilst also considering its relationships with the national government and partners. Climate change and disaster risks must be dealt with in the context of local development. Actions towards increasing resilience should become an integral part of local development plans that multiple partners support. The ownership of each plan is with the respective Island Councils.  The government of Kiribati has so far carried out integrated vulnerability assessment (IVA) on 6 outer islands and this effort will be intensified once assistance is secured from the LDCF. UNDP is currently assisting Kiribati in preparing project documents for approximately AUS $9m to be submitted to GEF in support of this activity, although this may be at risk if Kiribati graduates from LDC status, which is being considered in mid-2018. 
b. Kiribati Joint Implementation Plan for Climate Change and Disaster Risk Management. The Government of Kiribati, following consultation with regional technical advice, initiated the process for developing the Kiribati Joint National Action Plan for Climate Change and Disaster Risk Management (KJIP) in 2011. The KJIP complimented the National Disaster Risk Management Plan (2012) and the National Framework for Climate Change and Climate Change Adaptation (2013) by identifying tangible actions to build resilience and an integrated approach. The KJIP was initially published in 2014 and will undergo review in 2018. Upon completion, the revised KJIP will be submitted as the Kiribati National Adaptation Plan under the UNFCCC. 
c. 	Kiribati Adaptation Project Phase 3 (KAPIII) 
The Kiribati Adaptation Program has entered its third phase and will end by December 2018.  The objective of KAPIII is to improve the resilience of Kiribati to the impacts of climate change on freshwater supply and coastal infrastructure.  KAPIII will achieve this objective by strengthening government capacity to appropriately address these issues and improving the management and governance of water resources and infrastructure.   
The program is a complex undertaking (total cost of US$10.8m), involving a number of related activities by several ministries and agencies that also have many other responsibilities.  Some of those activities will require initiative, effort and follow-through.  A number of national and external consultants have been mobilised to supplement the staff resources of line ministries.  The four main components are: to improve water resource use and management; increase coastal resilience; strengthen the capacity to manage the effects of climate change and natural hazards; and project management, monitoring and evaluation.   
d. 	Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (Mitigation) 
Kiribati is not obligated under the UNFCCC to reduce its emissions of greenhouse gases.  Nonetheless, there have been significant efforts to reduce fossil fuel imports and increase domestic renewable energy use.  Alongside greater investment in solar renewables by development partners to supplement generation by the Public Utilities Board, the setting up of the Kiribati Solar Company which provides solar lighting on rural islands and markets solar appliances, trailing of coconut oil-based biofuel and on-grid solar PV on urban Tarawa illustrate these efforts.  For mitigation, Kiribati has made a commitment \0xECto reduce emissions by: 13.7% by 2025 and 12.8% by 2030 compared to a BaU (Business as Usual) projection\0xD6 and can enhance its commitment by an additional 48.8% by 2025 and 49% by 2030, conditional on support and assistance provided.  Kiribati further committed to \0xECproactively protect and sustainably manage its mangrove resources, as well as protect and enhance coastal vegetation and sea grass beds.   
Implementation of Ozone Depleting Substance (ODS) Regulation 
Additional to climate change obligation, MELAD also houses the ODS Project which established the ODS Regulation in 2017. Reducing ODS is an obligation of the Kiribati government under the Montreal Protocol. This regulation was put in place to control the import, export, handling, storage, use and sell of ODS at the national level. 	 

  
SDG Goal 14: Conserve and sustainable use of oceans, seas, and marine resources 
 
The sea is an important source of protein food and income for the people of Kiribati, and the most important source of income for Government through fishing licenses.  The Government has taken necessary steps to conserve and ensure sustainable use of her oceans, seas and marine resources through the prudent management of fishing licenses and fishing effort.  The Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources Development (MFMRD) has the mandate of the national fishery and marine resources.  
The following are some of the efforts made to sustainably manage these resources: 
Fisheries Policy 2013 n 2025.   
For the Policy, the Government of Kiribati will work on the five strategic objectives: (1) to support economic growth and employment opportunities, through sustainable fisheries, aquaculture and marine resources development, (2) protect and secure food security and sustainable livelihoods for I-Kiribati, (3) ensure long-term conservation of fisheries and marine ecosystems, (4) strengthen good governance with a particular focus on building the capacity of MFMRD to implement and support fisheries management, development, and monitoring, control and surveillance, and (5) to build climate change resilience for fisheries and marine resources in Kiribati. 
The Government is also promoting the introduction of larger fishing vessels, advancing the legislation to govern seabed mining activities, and has declared all of Kiribati as a shark sanctuary from 2016. 
Fisheries Act 2010.  
Under the Fisheries Act 2010, MFMRD is tasked to promote sustainable management of fisheries and the development and use of fisheries resources for the benefit of Kiribati, including the recovery of fees that reflect the value of resource, and to protect the fish stocks and marine environment of Kiribati.  Based on this Act, the Kiribati National Fisheries Policy 2013-2025 has been developed with aims that portray short, medium, and long-term strategic objectives that will enhance responsible fisheries management with emphasis on the need to support, improve, and sustain the peoplesi livelihood, food security and sustainable economic growth. 
Community Based Fisheries Management (CBFM) 
This is a regional project that Kiribati is benefiting from, with $3.8 million shared between 3 countries n Kiribati holding $1.2 million. The objective of the project is to develop and nurture the structures, processes and the capacity to implement and sustain the national programs of CBFM.   
The Observer Program 
The Observer Program on foreign fishing vessels allows close monitoring and control of fishing in the Kiribati waters through Kiribati workers placed on each fishing vessel and maintains a log of catches providing required details in the log template that MFMRD prepares. 
Engaging local councils 
There are also fisheries programs to safeguard resources and food security rendered to outer islands.  The public provision of Te Waa-n-O (local fishing canoes) empowers families in the outer islands to fish for food or income in more distant and deeper waters.  The Government has also supported ice plants, with funding assistance from Japan, to all outer islands to help with storage of catch for transport and marketing.  Fishery cooperatives in a number of outer islands also facilitate community groups to share fishing equipment and storage.   
Island council by-laws exist to ensure proper control of their marine/sea resources by requiring foreign fishing vessels to apply for the Council approval. At the national level, the Fisheries Act outlines proper control and measures for foreign fishing companies, consistent with the conditions of international agreements like the Parties to the Nauru Agreement (PNA).  Alongside laws are policies on conservation and the prudent management of marine resources.   
Bringing PIPA home 
The Phoenix Island Protected Area (PIPA) is a marine protected area which Kiribati declared as a closed to any fishing activity. It has been internationally recognized and registered as a world heritage site. It is discussed at length under SDG 15 and is a crucial element to effective management of the national fishery. 
A continuation of the marine protect areas approach is currently being trialled by the PIPA Secretariat in other areas of Kiribati.  This is recognized as the \0xEBBringing PIPA Homei initiative and is currently on trial with the Betio Town Council on South Tarawa. Outside of allocating areas as marine reserves, the concept is also extended to a cleaning campaign to make the town healthy and pleasant for members of society and visitors. 
Joint ventures 
Joint venture undertaken between Kiribati and Foreign Companies serves as an important development measure for the national fishery.  For example, the Kiribati Fish Limited (established in 2010) aims to provide employment and other benefits to the people (such as affordable fish prices and varied fish products) in a sustainable manner. KFL has been largely successful in creating local demand for the less destructive long-line fishing industry, which has been able to provide greater volumes of high-value tuna loins to local and international markets. 
The Environment (Amendment) Act 2007 
The Environment and Conservation Division MELAD is mandated under the Environment Act to conserve the environment. While implementing this Act, an environment licensing system is put in place to ensure environment significant activities including foreshore activities minimize adverse impact to marine resources.  
Conservation of marine resources are also regulated under Environment Act 2007 through the licensing and enforcement programs and scientific research permits. ECD also has the Integrated Community Based Mangrove and Natural Resources Co-Management Plan (CBMMP) that contributes to the conservation and sustainability of marine resources.  
The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands site in Nooto, North Tarawa contains a range of coastal ecosystems that support high levels of biodiversity and are rich in resources.  The site is also an important breeding area for marine species, including endangered species, and is one of the few areas in Kiribati where mangroves grow naturally.   
 	 

 
 
SDG Goal 15: Sustainably manage forest, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation, halt biodiversity loss 
 
Kiribati ratified the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (UNCBD) in 1994, the International Treaty of Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA) in 2005, the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety in 2004, and is also a party to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD).  It has National Biodiversity Planning Committee (NPBC) which is made up of multi-disciplinary team comprising of stakeholders from a variety of Government Ministries as well as Civil Society partners.   
Kiribati has a large ocean territory with rich marine biodiversity. Kiribati declared the Phoenix Islands a Marine Protected Area (PIPA) at COP 7 of the United Nation on Convention of Biological Diversity (UNCBD) in Brazil, in 2006. At the time, this was the largest marine protected area in the world. The ocean surface of PIPA is 410,500 km2 or 11.7% of the Kiribati EEZ n comfortably above the 10% Aichi Target 11 (of the UNCBD) and SDG Target 14.5 to conserve 10% of coastal and marine seas by the year 2020.  
The PIPA is a showcase of Kiribatiis commitment to its biodiversity.  It is home to a number of predatory fish, sea turtles, sea birds, corals, giant clams and coconut crabs, most of which have been depleted elsewhere in the region. More than 120 species of coral thrive in PIPA whilst 514 species of reef fish have been identified, including several new species, with unique assemblages reflecting PIPAis remoteness in the central Pacific. The coral-reef-based ecosystem, unlike most of the reefs in the world today, is healthy with an abundance of key marine species seldom encountered elsewhere. 
In 2010 the PIPA was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, and in 2015 the Government implemented a full closure of the PIPA to commercial fishing. PIPA is considered of crucial scientific importance for calibrating the effects of isolated fishing events, monitoring the process of sea level change, and evaluating the effects of climate change.  Recent analysis confirms that PIPA is a spawning ground for skipjack, yellowfin and bigeye tuna, which supports its role as assisting the long term sustainability of the entire Pacific fishery. Therefore, PIPA is protecting tuna stocks for Kiribatiis most important economic asset n its national fishery. 
Kiribatiis biodiversity is prone to severe issues and over exploitation through human induced activities and exacerbated by climate change impacts. Under the UNCBD, Kiribati is obligated to develop a National Biodiversity Strategic Action Plan (NBSAP) to protect, manage and conserve biodiversity. The NBSAP 2016-20 aims to protect and conserve biodiversity and is complemented by the Kiribati Biodiversity Area Report (KBA).  
In contrast to its maritime environment, the indigenous land-based flora and fauna of Kiribati are among the poorest on earth and there are few, if any, endemic species.  The people have developed sophisticated agriculture systems based mainly on coconut, breadfruit, pandanus and swamp taro.  
Kiritimati Island, in the Line Group, is the largest atoll in the world and holds a diversity of avifauna that is of both regional and international significance.  The atoll provides nesting, roosting, feeding and migration sites for over 40 bird species.  The LPIDS 2016-36 is a big step forward in managing the development in Kiritimati and other Line and Phoenix Islands.  and includes environmental sustainability as a key consideration to development efforts.  In the context of a fragile ecosystem and limited rainfall, Goal 3 of the LPIDS 2016-36 states that the plan will \0xECeffectively manage the biodiversity and urban settlements on Kiritimati island in particular.

In terms of the target to \0xECEnsure womenis full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision making in political, economic and public life, Kiribati still has significant room for improvement. Women are still more likely to not participate in the workforce, have higher unemployment rates, tend to work more as self-employed workers in non-formal sectors, and are less likely to be employers themselves.

There are 12 weeks of maternity leave in the public sector, fully paid for the first two births only. Maternity leave can only be taken six weeks prior to delivery and six weeks after delivery. 
These general trends appear to be reversed for young population however, with female participation and performance in schools consistently better than that their male colleagues, and female youth more likely to participate in the workforce (despite the higher unemployment rate). Females also tend to dominate tertiary scholarships, exceeding the number of male participants by consistently 50% or more.

The 2015 Census records for legislators, senior officials and managers (Table 5.12) highlights a large representation gap, with males occupying 63% (484) of the total senior occupations. There is a particularly striking gap in the elected positions, with Members of Parliament (94% male) and Island Councillors (95% male) showing almost no female representation.   
The same pattern is observed in the police and magistrate judges (Table 5.13).  Of the 572 police positions, only 32 are held by women and of the 50 judges, 22 are women.  However, gender representation in government ministries, SOEs and Statutory bodies show more balanced representation, with 54% of the positions held by women in 2015. This ratio was maintained in 2017, with 44% of the public service workforce being female and 38% male (18% of positions were vacant), with females occupying 54% of occupied posts.

Gender sensitisation and mainstreaming has become entrenched and evident in most government processes. The 2015 Census included indicators to measure womenis economic activities and rate awareness on the major principles of the Te Rau n te Mwenga Act 2012.  Gender parity has increasingly become the norm in the composition of decision making bodies such as Boards of Public Companies, the Public Service Commission, and interview panels for civil service recruitment. Since 2003 women have also held high public offices with the appointment of the first woman Vice President in that year.  
The first woman Secretary to the Cabinet was appointed in 2003 and this position has been held by women from then until now (2018), except for a period from 2007-2009. As recently as 2015, all of Kiribatiis three diplomatic missions overseas were headed by women.  
While women have often dominated the more junior management positions in Kiribati Government, by 2018, 8 of the 15 Permanent Secretaries heading government ministries are women.

Changes are happening at a slower pace in informal sectors and traditional settings. The need to strengthen womenis economic empowerment is necessary given the relative lack of access to, and control over, economic resources in the form of land and personal property because of traditional ownership norms and laws. In the private sector, more women have become successful owners of private companies owning some of the largest most successful businesses, although they are still relatively few in number. 
Education 
The Education Act enacted in 2013 aims to provide for an education system in Kiribati that makes available to every student a high-quality education that will i) help maximize the studentis educational potential; ii) enable the student to become an effective and informed member of the community and iii) promote compulsory education.  
The principles of Inclusive Education are also provisioned for in the Act.  In the application guidelines, the Act prohibits disciplining a student because she is pregnant or is a parent (section 41.2).  Education curriculum is also mainstreamed for gender equality and gender-based violence responsiveness and prevention.  The purpose of teaching young children is for them to learn non-discriminatory behaviours, loving and caring attitudes, and building respectful relationships in school. 
The Government has made notable progress to support inclusive education through free and compulsory education, Junior Secondary School accessibility in all islands, provision of free basic school materials, and transport services for primary and JSS.  TVET at KIT has also demonstrated considerable improvements in supporting women to take courses in conventionally male dominated programs (although the opposite is not true). 
As was noted under KPA1, females have generally outperformed their male counterparts in academic pursuits. Education analysis of the 2015 Population Census demonstrated a vast improvement in female education outcomes.  Female numbers are consistently higher at the different levels of education (primary, secondary, and tertiary), with higher levels of education reinforcing increasingly large gaps between the genders, especially in the below-25 age cohort.

Indeed, the gap in education at the junior and secondary levels has noticeably shifted away from males, with young men now the main demographic of concern regarding consistently poor performance, attendance, and dropout rates. This trend is already well entrenched at the tertiary level, with KIT and university admissions strongly favouring female students. This may create significant social issues in future years, with a relatively poorly educated cohort of young men who are unable to engage in the increasingly services-based Kiribati and global economy. 
Gender-based violence 
Gender discrimination remains culturally entrenched, despite recent improvements.  Gender Equality in Kiribati presents a major challenge that will take sustained normalisation over a period of years before noticeable changes can occur. This was clearly demonstrated during the IWD 2018 \0xEBpleai that women made for Government to consider redoubling efforts to eliminate the continued violence against women.  
Kiribati signed and adopted the CEDAW in 2004.  The Government has worked on its overdue CEDAW, CRPD and UNICEF reports with the assistance of regional organisations such as UNWomen, UNICEF, RRRT/Pacific Community, and OHCHR in Fiji. Whilst reporting is yet to be made public, the reports note the large body of work to address the obligations to end discrimination and address gender equality for the elimination of violence against women and girls. There is limited capacity in data and reporting to show the impact, but experience and observation show a generally higher awareness and public appreciation of what the government and partners are doing to address discrimination and gender issues.   
As a result of awareness raising, there is an increase of reporting to the police on domestic violence showing that more women or the population are more aware of their rights and protection under the law. Cultural barriers continue to be a persistent issue that decision makers and the advocators identify as a priority in this area. This has been supported by increased advocacy efforts support from donor partners programs and projects.

The Behavioural Change program 2014/2015 supported by the World Bank support to SAFENET, mainstreaming of gender in the KJIP, curriculum changes to address gender equality, and Ending Violence Against Women and Girls Through Respectful Relationships programs are a few of the attempts that Government has already implemented to try and reduce gender-based violence.  Along with these are ongoing annual advocacy campaigns such as the white ribbon day, 16 days of activism, orange day, Black Thursdays, and the marking of International Womenis Day. 
The establishment of the MWYSSA in 2013 was a priority by the government in recognition of women and youth issues.  Focused attention had been the adoption of human rights principles in national legislation including the Children, Young Persons and Family Welfare Act 2013, Education Act 2013, Juvenile Justice Act 2013, and Te Rau n te Mweenga (TRNTM) Act 2014.   There is need however to fund and address the areas identified in the TRNTM Act National Implementation Plan launched in December 2017. 
At the policy level, the Elimination of Sexual and Gender Based Violence policy and the draft Gender Equality and Women Development policy are two key Government policies for EVAW and ESGBV.  
Awareness support programs through Human Rights trainings for the public conducted in outer islands and in Tarawa, alongside consultations for the new TRNTM and training of SAFENET members in outer islands, comprise key work by the Ministry.  In partnerships with communities and island councils, Government and development partners support annual campaigns for Gender Equality and the elimination of violence against women and girls.   
In collaboration with UNFPA, support to improve essential services through the UN Womenis Essential Services Program (ESP 2017-2018) aims to fund assistance for survivors to get immediate service/response at an internationally comparable level. Police, Judiciary, Health, Social Welfare services are key stakeholders being supported to deliver integrated support to survivors.  
There is increased appreciation of prioritizing the gender-based violence (GBV) by service providers:   
\0xEF MHMS has instituted a specialized service counter for counselling and urgent treatment of survivors through the RMNCAH program with support of UN Women.   
\0xEF The courts are recognising the need to expedite hearing of Domestic Violence cases and priority is given by the court to these cases.  Currently the judiciary is supported to improve its Bench Book and have it translated for better service by all courts nationwide.   
\0xEF The Judiciary has also been supported to improve the witness/survivor court hearing system to enable a distant hearing facility to ensure security/safety as well as avoid direct encounters of the survivor/witness with perpetrators.   
\0xEF The MWYSSAis SAFENET (under initial World Bank and UN Women late support) committees and activities in Tarawa and outer islands are revived under the ESP to continue its important role in monitoring and case management, to ensure Domestic Violence and VAWG cases receive due and appropriate support.   
\0xEF Extended focus from campaigns for elimination to primary prevention of VAWG has received support by DFAT and UN Women with a four-year program on Strengthening Peaceful Villages approved and implemented in late 2017.   
\0xEF A new MHMS Healthy Family clinic serving survivors of GBV providing counselling services and referral support to appropriate authorities such as police, health, crisis centre was successfully built and operational in 2016.  The Healthy Family clinics also aim to provide integrated health delivery by providing general health and family planning support. 
The Government also continuously supports and works together with NGOs who are partners in the combat to end violence including KFHA, OLSH Crisis Centre, Alcohol Awareness and Family Recovery centre (AAFR), AMAK and the Kiribati Women and Children Support Centre (KWCSC).  Partnerships with communities and island councils continues in annual campaigns against violence against women and girls and Gender Equality, with support of donor partners (Australia, UNWomen).  MWYSSA works with NGOs closely sitting on a number of its National Committees for ESGBV, SAFENET, and National Womenis special events Committees. 
However, there is always more to be done, and the journey toward gender equality and the elimination of gender-based violence is far from complete. Even with a number of reviews undertaken, the Constitution of Kiribati still has gaps on gender rights, the Native Landis Ordinance does not recognize equality between men and women in terms of land ownership and rights, the Immigration Act is not in favour a foreign husbandis rights for citizenship, and the restriction on the number of maternity leaves available for mother in the National Conditions of Service (to only two occasions) is still problematic (even if this rule is unevenly enforced).  
 
 
Goal 16: Promote Just, Peaceful and Inclusive Societies 
 
Kiribati ratified the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) on September 27, 2013 - declaring to the international community that Kiribati is ready to implement the principles of this convention in its national policies and legislation.  In the margins of the 7th Conference of the State Parties to the UNCAC in 2017, Kiribati negotiated a resolution for the Small Island Developing States (SIDS). This SIDS resolution recognized that corruption could undermine the ability to address climate change by damaging the already limited natural resources of SIDS. The Resolution was adopted by the majority vote in the conference and strongly supported and co-sponsored by European Union, US, UK, Australia, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Haiti, Honduras, Nauru, Marshall Islands, FSM, Cook Islands and Tuvalu.  
In 2016, the Government tabled and adopted the Leaders Code of Conduct Act 2016 to provide a legal framework for the oversight of current and former leaders of the Government. Following the establishment of this legislation, the Public Service Integrity and Corruption Control Unit and the National Anti-Corruption Committee were formally established in 2017 with the legal mandate of regulating, assessing, investigating and reporting on all corruption held against an individual public servants or leaders, respectively. The other major roles of these bodies include the timely submission of Kiribati reports (self-assessment report, and report on UNCAC resolutions) to United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), and to make recommendations to Government on new anti-corruption initiatives. The Public Service Integrity and Corruption Control Unit is currently undergoing systematic work to develop the Anti-Corruption Code of Conduct for the public service, which is expected to be complete by the end of 2018 n integrating this work into the Public Service Act is expected to follow in 2019. Additionally, in 2018 the Government fully funded the independent Leadership Commission to further strengthen national institutions in this area. 
The 2017-2019 National Anti-Corruption Strategy is the first ever national document developed for anti-corruption and guides Government in achieving its goal of preventing and fighting corruption in Kiribati. The reforms aim at bringing and instilling the ethical values (transparency, accountability and integrity) of Good Governance. The strategy covers eight fundamental thematic areas:  
i) 	Anti-Corruption in the Public Sector,  ii) 	Institutional Capacity Building,  
iii) Public Finance Management and Procurement,  iv) Criminalization and Law Enforcement,  v) Public Awareness and Education,  vi) Legislation Review,  
vii) 	Fighting Corruption in the Private Sector, and  viii) 	International Cooperation and Asset Recovery.    
Government, through the Public Service Office, has organized consultative workshops with relevant Government entities and Anti-Corruption Committee members to better align the activities of the Kiribati National Anti-Corruption Strategy with SDG Goal 16, particularly with target indicators 16.3.2, 16.4, 16.5, 16.6, 16.7 and 16.10.  
Due to recent successes and its commitment in the fight against corruption, Kiribati has been declared to the international community as an Anti-Corruption Champion for Pacific Island Countries. As a Pacific Champion, the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC), in collaboration with other international agencies, have agreed that Kiribati should host the first ever Pacific Leaders AntiCorruption Regional Meeting in 2019.  
Prior to that regional meeting, Government has also planned to hold a National High-Level Panel Discussion on Anti-Corruption in 2019 to engage political leaders, church leaders, women societies, youth groups, union and employer organizations on ways to combat corruption at the national level. It is anticipated that this panel discussion will result in the signing of a National Political Declaration or a Joint Pledge documenting the joint promise of regulating and eliminating corruption.  
Progress has also been made in strengthening audit and financial management institutions:   
\0xEF Government ministries and SOEs are required to perform annual auditing by the Kiribati Audit Office (KAO), with audit reports tabled with the Speaker of the House. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of the Parliament is tasked to monitor Ministries and SOEs audit reports at every Parliamentary session. Prior to 2017, the KAO was only required to perform financial audits, but the passage of the Audit Act 2017 enables the KAO to fulfil its obligation under the KDP 2016-19 to conduct full performance audits on financial processes. This will ultimately result in much more rigorous auditing reports being tabled and debated in the PAC. 
\0xEF Stemming from the ERT, a review of the national procurement system undertaken by the ADB in 2016 revealed systemic issues with the current procurement system including a complicated Act and poor enforcement. The associated recommendations of the review were accepted in 2017, with the recruitment of a Chief Procurement Officer (CPO) and Unit taking place in 2018. The ADB and New Zealand are also jointly funding TA for the CPO to amend or replace the current Procurement Act, as well as revise and promulgate new a new Procurement Procedures manual.  
\0xEF The recent approval of a new Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS; also ADB funded in 2017) will allow for better commitment and payment control, as well as improve financial oversight, reporting and audit capability. The scoping work for the new IFMIS has already commenced, with the procurement and implementation of the new system being a primary focus for MFED and development partners over the coming years. 
\0xEF The SOE Act of 2013 requires much more structured and transparent processes surrounding SOE financial planning and reporting. Through the SOE reform program, there has been a dramatic improvement in the timeliness of financial statements from SOEs, which are submitted to Parliament via the NEPO office in MFED. The SOE Act also outlines the criteria for Community Service Obligations, which increases the transparency surrounding the subsidisation of non-commercial services provided by SOEs.  
\0xEF A capacity building program has also been put in place with the Pacific Association of Supreme Audit Institutions (PASAI) and other regional partners to build the capability of the KAO to execute its expanded role. 
All told, these reforms will give the KAO and MFED the tools and mandate to provide much more detailed, comprehensive, and timely financial and audit reports.  
In addition to improvement financial management the government is also aiming to uplift customer service operations for the public, and improve the PSOis ability to better monitor and evaluate civil service employee performance.  A new Division (Public Service Performance and Services Management) was recently established for this specific purpose.   
The KV20 has Governance as one of its central pillars with the aim of creating a corrupt free society by 2036.  The Governance Pillar aims to further strengthen national and local traditional and governance policy and legislative frameworks; foster and strengthen the integrity and independence of institutions mandated to promote good governance and eliminate corruption; strengthen strategic partnerships; and institutionalize anti-corruption and good governance principles in the public service and education systems in Kiribati.  The continued focus on this Pillar has been welcomed by Parliamentarians, the Private Sector (Business Community) and Church Leaders including their Executive members. 
Consistent with this vision, more work is required to lift capacity in the management and delivery of public service programs and institutions.  In particular, there is a need for centralization of anticorruption information, a re-assertion of the independence of anti-corruption institutions, and continued efforts to improve the standards applied to public financial management and reporting. Service delivery standards also need to be improved to ensure that increased government services are delivered to the public efficiently and effectively. While not covered in great depth here, there is also a need to ensure that police officers and the judiciary are adequately equipped, trained, and accessible to deliver effective justice services to all members of the public. 
Furthermore, financial inclusion remains elusive, with formal banking services not reaching the most vulnerable, especially in the outer islands. The Outer Island Councils also require dedicated governance support, something that is highlighted in the yet to be funded Kiribati Local Governance and Rural Development (KIRLOG) project. 
 	 
 
KPA 6: Infrastructure 
 
Faced with increasing pressure from climate change conditions, the KDP 2016-19 stipulates the need for high resilience and sustainability of infrastructure in urban and rural areas. This applies in the constructions of causeways, roads, airfields, sea ports, seawall defences, building and construction, safe water and sanitation, renewable energy, inter-island transport systems and telecommunications. It also necessitates the formulation and application of an infrastructure maintenance plans. 
 
 
 
SDG 6: Ensure Water Access and Sanitation for All 
 
The National Water Policy 2008 and its three key objectives remains relevant to Kiribatiis need to address vulnerability in the face of climate change, population growth, scarce resources, safety concerns and the health issues of water borne diseases.  Water is a scarce commodity in Kiribati and is sourced from underground freshwater lens and from rain.  It is therefore critical for Kiribati to ensure it continued availability and quality for human consumption.  The water unit within the MISE monitors the ground water availability and issues regular updates to the Public Utilities Board, the main supplier of drinking water for the more populous urban centre of South Tarawa. With a rapidly growing population, and a diminishing and polluted freshwater lens, the water issues on the main island are acute. 
The medium-term reform plan for PUB in South Tarawa is ongoing. Under this reform plan and New Zealand assistance, training and up-skilling of PUB technical staff was implemented since 2016, revised electricity tariff rates were applied, and the upgrading of the electricity distribution network will complete in 2018. In terms of water distribution, the World Bank contributed to the piloting of a 24hrs a day water supply to households in the first 3 villages on South Tarawa. This will serve as the basis for The South Tarawa Water Supply Project (STWSP), whose objective is to supply 6ML of additional desalinated water into the PUB water reticulation system by 2030. The STWSP is jointly funded by the ADB, World Bank and GCF. The Project Preparatory Technical Assistance (PPTA) phase has been completed and would lead into the next phase of the Project Design Advance (PDA).  
These efforts build on the South Tarawa Sanitation Improvement Sector Project (STSISP) which started in 2011 with the aim of improving the health of the people in communities of South Tarawa through the rehabilitation of the existing sewerage and salt water flushing system.  The project is part of the existing PUBis managed sewerage system on South Tarawa covering the main centres of population in Bikenibeu, Bairiki and Betio and serving 1,034 out of 7,877 households in these areas. The project will also renovate the sewerage outfall systems.  
Part of the STSISP is community engagement to help with the sustainability of the systems. Public awareness programmes to promote the water, hygiene and sanitation are part of this initiative. Onsite sanitation project saw the construction of 33 toilet blocks on 28 different sites in non-sewer covered areas of South Tarawa. These facilities are equipped with septic tanks and are serviced with sewerage trucks.   
Other community sanitation programs are being undertaken by Civil Societies including the Kiribati Red Cross Society (KRCS) supported by the Government of Australia.  Under this initiative, the KRCS Community Based Health Program has assisted church-based community groups built 14 toilet blocks providing 104 toilets that drain into the PUBis sewerage system.  Each block is equipped with water tank and groundwater well for flushing.  On successful completion and positive impacts of this initial project, the intervention will be replicated in other densely populated urban villages. 
The Outer Islands 
The water unit within MISE also provides updates to the 	National 	Water 	Committee 	on 	drought conditions in Kiribati., with the outer islands also facing acute water issues. With limited rain water catchment on most islands, the ground water is almost the only source of fresh water. A vulnerability assessment that was undertaken by the water unit with SPC in 2004 assists government identify program options to address water issues for the outer islands.  Table 5.17 shows a vulnerability assessment of ground water for all islands in Kiribati, with most islands showing high rates of vulnerability. 
To assist alleviate the pressing issues of the more vulnerable communities, the Government has installed 4 solar desalination systems and will install another 5 soon. Eight (8) more systems are planned to be installed for the remaining communities in the next 8 months. These systems will provide between 2,000 - 6,000L of additional water per day to each of the 17 communities.

In the Line Islands, the Kiritimati Water Supply Project funded by the EU and managed by the SPC, is seeing the near completion of an improved water supply system for communities from Decca-London in Kiritimati Island. The system which became operational in February of 2018, was commissioned the following month.  The upgrading of the existing systems in the Four-Wells for Tabwakea village water supply system had included the metering of all houses and fixing of leakages in the distribution network.   
In the Gilberts Group, there are two projects currently addressing the lack of potable water in the outer islands, the Kiribati Adaptation Project (KAP), supported jointly by the World Bank and MISE, and the Kiribati Water and Sanitation in Outer Islands Project Phase II (KIRIWATSAN II), supported by The European Union, SPC and MISE .  Under the KAP project, the water gallery installed in North Tarawa is 70% complete, while the rain water harvesting and reticulation system in Buota will complete in the second half of 2018.  
The KIRIWATSAN Phase II is addressing both facilities and capacity development across the 16 islands. Construction has commenced in Makin, Butaritari, Marekai and Abaiang while capacity building is ongoing; 80% of the facilities across the 7 islands (Butaritari, Marakei, Abaiang, Maiana, Nonouti, Beru and Nikunau) are expected to be completed by May 2019. Facilities will range from increased storage facilities, communal well improvement using Tamana pumps through to mini village infiltration galleries. The project also aims to introduce eco-friendly toilets to protect the fragile water lens, with the piloting of compost toilets across the 35 participating villages.  
The Kiribati Outer Island Food and Water (KOIFAWP) project with MELAD has provided 279 rain water harvesting systems and KIRIWATSAN I (funded by the EU and implemented by UNICEF an MISE) has provided an additional 355 rain water harvesting systems on islands which are considered at \0xEChigh vulnerability of water supply issues. 
The UNICEF programme WASH in Schools (supported by New Zealand) led by the Ministry of Education and communities in outer islands, focuses on both the facilities and the utilisation and maintenance of water, sanitation and hygiene in schools. It is a follow-up on the KIRIWATSAN I project where more than 40,000 people in the Gilbert islands were supported to make their village open defecation free (ODF). KIRIWATSAN focusses on increasing access to safe and sustainable water and sanitation to reduce WASH related diseases in the Gilbert group. In addition to these efforts, WASH in Schools phase 1 worked with 32 schools have access to improved water and sanitation and students practice improved hygiene standards on daily basis.  
\0xECBefore [the construction of toilets in my village] I only used the beach as my toilet and this was with a lot of shame. My children used the backyard. 
I am now living in a clean and hygienic environment and with this I feel happier than ever before. I will maintain my toilet clean and encourage my grandchildren to do the same. 
n Betio resident, Kiribati 
Eleven out of the 32 targeted schools have reached the ODF status in 2018. Access to toilets at home, but also practice are the key barriers. When a child does not have access to safe sanitation at all times, a new practice will not automatically become a natural behaviour. Eleven schools being ODF, is a remarkable achievement given the strong social culture around sanitation and the vulnerable environmental context.  
In terms of measuring community attitudes, the 
                                           UNICEF Shifting Norms in Kiribati Report (draft) asked what the social norm is for WASH in Abaiang. People responded that all people adapted to the new WASH standards. In addition to infrastructure and awareness programs provided by the national government, the elders in the island have been a powerful force for convincing local households to practice safe sanitation. Although open defecation is still practiced and evidence is not systematically collected or not available, the new practices and mindset has already led to a shift in social norms. Earlier self-reported experience showed that people were not familiar or uncomfortable with the use of toilet, but this has changed. Sustainable behaviour change, breaking through barriers towards improved and positive change, is a long-term commitment and encompasses the life cycle, from birth to adult.  
Additionally, UNICEF WASH in Healthcare Program lead Ministry of Health and Medical Services in 3 islands (South Tarawa, Betio and Abaiang) focus on the healthcare facility governance, facilities and capacity building of medical assistants/nurses on WASH to minimize the spread of infectious diseases in healthcare facilities.  At present the program has developed the WASH in Health Care Facilities Policy, repaired/rehabilitated WASH facilities in 22 health clinics/centers and trained 22 health workers (medical assistants/nurses) on WASH. 
UNICEF also provided support to Ministry of Infrastructure and Sustainable Energy in reconstituting the National Water Sanitation Coordination Committee (NWSCC) to address coordination issues in WASH sector and duplication of initiatives.  Currently, the NWSCC is leading the coordination work and updating of the National Water Resource Policy and 10-Year Implementation Plan. 
 	 

 
Goal 7: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all 
 
The recently adopted Kiribati Integrated Energy Roadmap 2017n2025, provided a guide for scaling up the renewable energy share of total production: 
\0xEF South Tarawa 61% - Solar, Battery and OTEC 
\0xEF Kiritimati central grid 69% - Solar, Battery and Wind 
\0xEF Rural Infrastructures and Communities 100% - Solar, Battery 
There is an increasing number of solar energy connections in outer islands. The distribution of 1,230 solar lighting kits in 2014-15 and the installation of 30 solar lighting systems for community halls, 18 systems for all island councilsi workshops, and 140 for outer islands teachersi residents, dramatically improved the provision of electric lighting.  Further, there is a 100% solar system coverage for all boarding secondary schools in the outer islands. All outer islands council offices and quarters and fish centres will be provided with solar PV or hybrid systems in 2018, further embedding renewable energy as a sustainable source of power for outer island communities.   
Three solar photovoltaic systems connected to the PUB Grid on South Tarawa have been completed and commissioned in 2017 providing an additional peak capacity of 1.4 MW, or 30 per cent of peak demand.  These include the Japanfunded 400 kWp system, the UAE-funded 500 kWp system and World Bank funded 516 kWp system. After the completion of these three PVgrid projects, the renewable energy share for South Tarawa grid now runs at 14% annually.  
The World Bankis news release \0xECKiribatiis Overreliance on Fuel to End with World Bank 
Project presents an informative brief on Solar 
\0xECFor too long, Kiribati n as one of the most remote countries in the world n has been dependent on imported fuel. This is not only a massive burden on our finances, but has a negative impact on the environment around us. 
As a nation profoundly affected by the impacts of climate change due to the worldis over-reliance on fossil fuels, it is important for us to practice what we preach. 
n The Hon. Korabi Nenem,  Vice President, Kiribati 
Energy at the Public Utilities Board and the 
benefits it will bring to address vulnerability of Kiribati from over-reliance on fuel, the population to benefit from the project, greenhouse gas emission reduction, and the dollar savings that government will make. It is estimated the energy generated from the World Bank investment alone reduce diesel fuel use by 230,000 litres per year, reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions by 765 tons, and save the Government of Kiribati US$290,000 annually. 
The electricity access to households in South Tarawa is around 80%, with PUB lowering its connection fee in 2018 to extend the distribution network to cover all households. Nevertheless, the funding from Taiwan and India for another 5,352 sets of solar light kits will be provided to the remaining households not accessing the grid on South Tarawa in 2018. 
In May 2018, the Kiritimati Energy Project Phase 1, funded by EU and New Zealand, commissioned the central grid supplying power from Ronton to Banana included the 180kWp PV-grid system and a rehabilitation to the Poland villageis Solar PV hybrid mini-grid.  Currently, the access coverage in all the villages is around 90% except for the Tabwakea 4 lease, where the distribution network had not been widely disseminated. Recently, Government had released around 1,500 land lease plots to local residents and will increase the access coverage on the island, thus, the service provider will need to address the access incrementally when the plots are settled. 
Another initiative has been solar lighting system for roads and causeways in the urban South Tarawa which has benefited motorists and road users at night and reduced potential accidents. The improved lighting also offers better security for pedestrians. 
For energy efficient systems and standards, a draft regulation on electrical/electronic appliances labelling will be finalized by end-2018 for approval by Cabinet and implementation under the proposed Consumer Protection Act 2018.   
The Kiribati Solar Energy Company was established as a means of implementing and sustaining the solar projects in the outer islands, with the project coverage shown below.

Goal 9: Build resilience infrastructure, promote sustainable industrialization and foster innovation 
 
Challenges from more frequent king tides and storms due to changing climate patterns have increasingly impacted the coastlines, causing physical damage to assets and economic and social losses to Government and communities. The climate change and impact vulnerability assessments of islands were undertaken in an effort to address coastline degradation and other climate change induced issues.  Through the vulnerability assessment reports, government is able to determine and deliver timely support to critical cases of coastal erosions and inundation.  
Government, in partnership with the phased World Bank supported Kiribati Adaptation Project (KAP) and other development partners, is undertaking coastal protection applying more robust seawall designs to withstand the impacts of the rising sea. This is necessary to protect crucial public infrastructure particularly roads, hospitals, community buildings, and other assets from exceptionally high waves and storms. One of the visible efforts in this direction is the total replacement of the \0xECsandbag seawall design with a new \0xECmass-concrete seawall design, which provides better and longer lasting protection.  
Development and adoption of climate proofing policies and codes for government, public and private buildings are also part of the Government response to the rising tide.  The Building Act 2006 seeks to implement measures to significantly improve the safety and standard of construction work in Kiribati.  A Building Code 2012 ensures that acceptable standards of structural sufficiency, fire safety, health and amenity, are maintained for the benefit of the Kiribati community.  The code allows, where appropriate, for variations in climate and geological risks (such as inundation).   
Since February 2017, the National Building Code of Kiribati (NBCK), has been applied to public buildings only. The Code requires that all public building constructions must have rainwater catchments and safe toilet systems. This is a direct and immediate push by the Government to fulfil SDG 6.  
Furthermore, it is anticipated that by end of 2018, the Code will include all classes of buildings including residential.  This implies that all constructions that will commence in 2019 will only receive approval if they include indication that they will have rainwater tanks and safe toilet facilities. 
A comprehensive maintenance plan for major public infrastructures and buildings is also being developed as part of the ERT for mainstreaming asset management and maintenance into the governmentis annual recurrent and development budgets.  
Given the remote and dispersed nature of the islands of Kiribati, transport and ICT infrastructure is a key component to bringing the nation together and enabling access to international markets. To realise the dream of a connected Kiribati, the Government has embarked on a series of road, airport, harbour and ICT infrastructure initiatives in recent years. 
The rehabilitation of the roads in South Tarawa to international standard was completed with road signs, solar street lights and improved junctions for safety of drivers and road users. The Kiribati Road Rehabilitation Project (KRRP) was the largest fully realised project in Kiribati history, with the major works completed in 2017 after 6 years of planning and construction supported by the World Bank, the ADB and Australia.  As a result of sealing the main road, travel times for South Tarawa residents were halved, air quality near the road was dramatically improved, 
and there was now a safe sidewalk for pedestrians. This led to a dramatic increase in the presence of roadside shops and stalls, increased car ownership, reduced vehicle repairs, and a significant rise in the provision of privately-owned public transport options. The project linked South Tarawa communities and enabled improvements in emergency services, commerce, and public service delivery right across the island. 
While the better road conditions have enabled higher travel speeds, together with increased congestion from more vehicles there has been an associated increase in the road toll from accidents. The Road Safety Act is in place to try and mitigate this undesirable outcome, but community appreciation for the new dangers will take time to develop.  
Regular maintenance of the roads is carried out through private contracts supervised by the MISE to ensure standards are upheld. 
The final section of roadway to be upgraded is the causeway between Bairiki and Betio. The reconstruction of the causeway will improve the crucial link between the two main areas of South Tarawa, and also link the main maritime port to the rest of the island. To be completed with the assistance from Japan by 2020, the causeway will enable improved travel times and facilitate improved delivery of utilities (water, power, and communications) between the two main population centres. The new design also improves the climate resilience of the causeway by increasing the elevation and reinforcing the seawalls that were breached during the storm-surge from tropical cyclone Pam in 2015. 
With the support of the World Bank, ICDF (Taiwan) and the Kiribati Government, the Kiribati Aviation Investment Project (KAIP) upgraded the runways at Bonriki (South Tarawa) and Cassidy (Kiritimati), raising the standard of the landing surface and supporting infrastructure to an internationally comparable level. Both runways are now able to receive bigger and increasing numbers of international and domestic flights into Kiribati.  Safety fences and night landing facilities for the international airport are part of this initiative and mean that Kiribati is now meeting the ICAO standards for aviation safety.  Renovation of the international airport terminal buildings will provide better airport services to incoming and outgoing passengers with the terminal buildings to be completed by the start of 2019. This investment is crucial to the KV20 emphasis on tourism development, and together with the reconstructed wharf at Betio (funded by Japan) represents the major logistical link between Kiribati and the outside world. 
In addition to investments in South Tarawa, Kiritimati Island (including the LPIDS), and Kanton (via the PIPA), the government has also embarked on an ambitious investment program in the outer islands of Kiribati. Building on the success of the cofinancing made by the World Bank, the ADB and the Government of Kiribati on KRRP and KAIP, the Outer Islands Infrastructure Project aims to connect the outer islands with the main economic hub of South Tarawa. 
The Outer Islands Infrastructure Project is likely to be parallel financed by development partners over a number of phases. The World Bank and ADB have concentrated their first phase on maritime infrastructure which will enable an immediate improvement in trade links, maritime safety, and the enabling environment for further public and private investment. The focus on building climateresilient infrastructure will also ensure improved all-weather access to some islands, as well as guard against predicted climate impacts. 
The first phase of Government funds will focus on road and airport infrastructure, with a particular focus on enabling airlinks to those islands that will serve as local hubs for expanded air services from Air Kiribati. Again, the focus for the new infrastructure is to create climate resilient, all weather, access to some of the most remote communities in Kiribati. 
In addition to transport infrastructure, the Kiribati Connectivity Project, jointly funded by the ADB and World Bank will construct two deep-sea cables to Kiribati: one to South Tarawa (the East Micronesian Cable System) and the other to Kiritimati Island (the Southerncross NEXT cable). Along with the recently completed reforms to the telecommunications sector, and investment in outer island connectivity, these two ICT cables will lead to a dramatic improvement in internet speed and affordability. This could be potentially transformative for the Kiribati economy and the delivery of public services. 
Taken together, these significant investments by the Government and development partners in enabling infrastructure will set a strong foundation for further economic growth and improved service delivery. 
 	 
 
Means of Implementation  
Goal 17: Revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development. 
 
 
A sustainable development agenda requires strategic and inclusive partnership between Government and national and international stakeholders n the private sector, civil society at all levels, intergovernmental organisations and development partners. Inclusive partnerships built upon shared principles, values, vision, and goals that place people at the centre of policy and decision making are a strong foundation of national, regional and global sustainable development programmes. 
Partnership between the public and private sectors, including knowledge transfer with NGOs and civil society, are some of the ongoing activities geared towards enhancing the partnerships for achieving the development goals. Given the connectivity challenges, the rapidly increasing penetration of mobile and data services along with the public and partner investment in connectivity infrastructure will provide new and improved ways to coordinate and create dialogue with the public through e-Government. This will require substantial investments within the public service, including the rollout of the IFMIS and digitisation of administrative functions to better respond to the growing demands for accessible public services.  
Government acknowledges the important role of strategic and inclusive partnership in the development and implementation of KV20. Government will develop and strengthen collaborative mechanisms for engaging various stakeholders to enhance a participatory approach during the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the KV20. The Government recognises the need to forge stronger partnerships with intergovernmental organisations and development partners to implement the KV20 in the context of the broader UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. International partnerships will be strengthened for effective resource mobilisation and sustained good governance, guided by the relevant international treaties and obligations.  
The Government also recognises the strong relationship it already shares with national, international, and sectoral partners, and would like to express its humble thanks for their continued partnership in progressing the development of the Kiribati people.  
Other considerations 
Domestic revenue mobilisation has improved dramatically in Kiribati. Tax revenues have increased from $27.3 million in 2011 to $38.4 million in 2016, but the major increase has overwhelmingly come from fishing licence revenue, which has increased from just $29.1 million in 2011 to $147.1 million in 2016. This has enabled a large increase in government spending on public service delivery, wages, transfers programs and infrastructure mentioned in this VNR, as well as repairing the Governmentis cash balances and restoring the sovereign wealth fund to a sustainable level.  
However, the infrastructure needs for Kiribati would far exceed the financial ability of the government to finance on its own. Indeed, the KRRP cost around one-third of the national GDP to seal around 50km of roads in the capital, but the outer islands have over 500km of road that is presently unsealed. Another example is the crucial maritime infrastructure in the outer islands, which must be replicated on each island, regardless of how small, dramatically increasing the cost of providing basic and safe access to the islands. For example, the World Bank and ADB assistance on the Outer Island Infrastructure project of around $40 million is equivalent to almost 20% of GDP, but will likely cover only 4 of the 22 populated islands with the needed maritime infrastructure. 
This infrastructure financing gap will become even more stark as the impact of climate change puts existing infrastructure under pressure, with some critical assets still unprotected from inundation and coastal erosion. In some cases, this infrastructure cannot be relocated due to the lack of available land and must instead be reinforced to continue to deliver services. Related to this will be the increasing burden of asset maintenance that will likely fall on the government budget and reduce the room for further investment. 
Social infrastructure also requires significant investments, with health and education systems particularly under strain from population growth, the high cost of service delivery, and limited internal capacity. In this regard, we welcome the continued support of our development partners in this area.  
Related to this, capacity building will feature as a key determinant in the success of implementing the SDGs in Kiribati, along with strengthening need for staff and institutions for a better data management capacity to meet international reporting standards, and importantly to facilitate informed decision making and mid-term and end-term evaluations. Public service standards will also need to improve to deliver the required level of education, health, justice, and public administration that is required to lift economic productivity and livelihoods. This includes both technical and non-technical capacity assistance and support from development partners to supplement local development efforts. 
The KV20 plays an important role in the implementation of SDGs.  It is designed to accelerate the progress in the selected sectors of fisheries and tourism, with a view to capturing the anticipated benefits for the people and Kiribati. This sets a strong direction for future reforms and possible legislation, but technical assistance will again form a crucial element in achieving the desired outcomes, as technical capacity within Kiribati is relatively limited.  
A key gap is also in the area of systems performance, with the IFMIS; data collection, warehousing, and analysis; and administrative IT systems of government requiring significant upgrading to keep pace with the rapid changes in service delivery. 
It is only through the continued building of partnerships, the support of development partners, and a continued improvement in resource mobilisation that Kiribati will be able to achieve its vision of a health, wealthy, and peaceful society.  
6 Conclusion and next steps 
Kiribati faces stark development challenges across a wide range of areas. Being able to identify the key challenges and direct the appropriate intervention are key to fostering effective outcomes. While the national planning frameworks of the 2016-19 KDP and the KV20 are comprehensive in their coverage, and consistent with the SDGs, adequate institutional capacity and financing to implement these plans continue to be challenging.  
The VNR and KDP Mid-Term Review process revealed a number of key areas for the improvement of monitoring and evaluation. While the overlap between the KV20, KDP and SDGs has produced a coherent set of focus areas across planning documents at the higher level, there is significant fragmentation between the indicators. This fragmentation creates challenges for institutional capacity that is already stretched to its capacity, and limits the ability of the government to incorporate data analysis without external technical assistance and support. While development partners have risen to the challenge, and provided widespread support in this area, capacity development of mainstream policy officers with the government remains a key challenge.  
With the publication of the KV20 and the setting of a new long-term vision, the KDP will need to be reviewed during the second half of its implementation, particularly around the selection of the indicator set. Indeed, the process of the VNR has already started this process by creating a unified national indicator set that can be refined and simplified. By creating this national scorecard, the Statistics Office is better placed to implement its National Statistics Development Strategy (NSDS) which would work to reinforce the national indicator set where data is weak or does not currently exist.  
The story of development for Kiribati is one of hope for the future. While health and urban indicators have proven stubbornly difficult to improve, progress in education suggests that the future leaders will have a greater capacity to address the many challenges that Kiribati faces, including the impact of climate change. Economic growth is improving, with the private sector continuing to show robust employment growth, and the government and development partners are continuing to invest heavily in new and improved infrastructure. The emergence of key partnerships in particular sectors has reduced fragmentation of effort, but institutional issues still affect service delivery in some areas, and despite improved economic and fiscal outcomes, the financing gap remains substantial. Even with all of its challenges, Kiribati continues to show that development in the smallest and most remote places in the world is not only possible but already happening.  
However, there is still a long way to go before development ambitions are achieved, with institutional capacity and financing continuing to be key challenges. With the increased impacts of climate change on health, infrastructure, and social programs, this challenge is likely to only get more pronounced over coming years.
