INTRODUCTION 

 
Sustainable development is a long-term development path for societies, states and the whole world. It is based on three pillars of equal importance: economic development, social development and environmental protection. The first steps aimed to consolidate sustainable development at global level were made more than 25 years ago. Back then Rio Declaration was adopted and the principles of sustainable development were laid down. The subsequent international instruments, such as the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, the Rio+20 Conference Conclusions, etc., set forth agreements among states to work towards a more sustainable world. However, the growing number of inhabitants, the dwindling natural resources, increasing pollution and other environmental, economic and social challenges that go beyond national state borders urge one to continuously remember and implement the principles of sustainable development. 
In September 2015, more than 150 world leaders in New York adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (hereinafter \0xEBthe 2030 Agendai). After being the subject of negotiations for more than two years, this document provides 17 new sustainable development goals (SDGs) and 169 targets that have replaced the Millennium Development Goals active since 2000. The SDGs are universal, they complement each other and reflect the equal importance of the three sustainable development pillars. The goals are important at the national and global levels and comprise global and national actions for a more sustainable world. The 2030 Agenda is more ambitious than Millennium Development Goals, embraces wider range of issues, and has to be implemented by both developing and developed countries. 
Adopting the 2030 Agenda, countries have committed themselves to present VNRis to the United Nations on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. Lithuania volunteered to prepare and present such a review in the third year of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. With approval of the United Nations Economic and Social Council, Lithuania has received an opportunity to present the VNR at a High-level Political Forum (HLPF) in July 2018 in New York (USA). At this meeting, VNRs on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda will be presented by 48 states, with 10 European Union (hereinafter \0xEBEUi) member states among them. 
This VNR of Lithuania presents information on how Lithuania contributes to the implementation of the SDGs. It introduces the process and method of preparation, as well as the national legal framework and institutional implementation mechanisms for sustainable development, the economic, social and environmental aspects of implementation, cooperation with non-governmental organisations and research institutions. The review contains a detailed description of the implementation of each sustainable development goal with a particular focus on the priority areas distinguished by the Government of the Republic of Lithuania: reducing poverty, social exclusion and income inequality, promoting employment; strengthening public health, increasing the quality of health care and access to health care services; developing innovative economy and smart energy; quality education and development cooperation. Particular attention is devoted to five sustainable development goals singled out as the thematic goals of the 2018 HLPF: Goal 6. Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all; Goal 7. Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all; Goal 11. Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable; Goal 12. Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns, and Goal 15. Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss. 
 
 
 
 
NATIONAL LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND INSTITUTIONAL IMPLEMENTATION MECHANISMS FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS  
 
In accordance with the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation adopted in 2002 and the guidelines of the European Council, in 2003 the Government of the Republic of Lithuania approved the National Strategy for Sustainable Development (hereinafter \0xEBNSSDi). In 2009, the NSSD was updated with an aim to harmonise this Strategy with the EU Sustainable Development Strategy. Lithuanian sustainable development priorities and principles are established taking into account Lithuaniais national interests and peculiarities. The NSSD provides strategic goal of sustainable development which involves balancing environmental, economic and social development interests, ensuring a clean and healthy environment, effective consumption of natural resources, universal economic welfare of society and strong social guarantees; and during the Strategy implementation period (until 2020) achieving, in terms of economic and social indicators as well as efficiency of natural resource consumption, the EU15 average of 2003, while keeping the environmental pollution indicators within the limits permissible in the EU and respecting the requirements imposed by the international conventions limiting environmental pollution and the impact on the world climate. The NSSD is a long-term development strategy of the state identifying principles and goals that are transferred to sectoral strategies and programmes. 
Lithuania has established a National Commission for Sustainable Development (hereinafter \0xEBNCSDi) which is headed by the Prime Minister of the Republic of Lithuania and includes the ministers and representatives of non-government organisations, business associations and research institutions. The main functions of the NCSD are to analyse and assess biennial reviews on the implementation of the National Strategy for Sustainable Development and make proposals to the Government of the Republic of Lithuania concerning the updating of the NSSD and sustainable development priorities with account of the environmental, social, economic and cultural indicators of the state. 
Under the Government resolution approving the NSSD, the Ministry of Environment is obliged to coordinate the implementation of the NSSD. With a view to ensuring the appropriate implementation of the NSSD, the Ministry of Environment has established a working group of experts which in cooperation with other national authorities help the Ministry of Environment to prepare NSSD implementation reviews for presentation to the NCSD. 
In 2016n2017, Lithuania carried out analysis of the compatibility of the 2030 Agenda with the national strategic planning documents, including the NSSD. It was found that most of the United Nations sustainable development goals and targets were in fact reflected in Lithuaniais strategic planning documents and the Government four-year action programme. Until the end of the term of the NSSD in 2020, the 2030 Agenda will be implemented through the enforcement of the existing strategic planning documents and monitoring of indicators provided for by them. 
Taking into account that the sustainable development goals laid down in the 2030 Agenda must be implemented by 2030, and those provided for in the NSSD by 2020, it is planned to update Lithuaniais Progress Strategy \0xEBLithuania 2030i. It would lay down development goals for Lithuania until 2030 and a vision until 2050. This is Lithuaniais main overarching development strategy covering all development aspects of the country. In view of this, it is especially important that Lithuaniais Progress Strategy establishes a long-term sustainable development policy for the state and integrates the 2030 Agenda goals appropriately. 
At the end of 2017 the preparation of the comprehensive plan of Lithuaniais territory for the new period was launched. This plan will integrate the 2030 Agenda goals. The plan should become the major strategic document on the development and spatial expression of the territory of Lithuania. 
Lithuania finds the proper implementation of the 2030 Agenda very important. Therefore, a great deal of attention is devoted to its legal framework and institutional implementation mechanism. This process involves all national authorities, their work being coordinated by the Ministry of Environment in cooperation with the Office of the Government of the Republic of Lithuania. 
REVIEW PREPARATION PROCESS AND METHODOLOGY  

 
The Lithuanian Government has approved priorities for the VNR, appointed the Government Office and the Ministry of Environment as the coordinating authorities of the VNR preparation and authorised all ministries to provide information within their respective competence required for the VNR preparation and engage as many stakeholder groups in this process as possible. 
To implement the Government decisions on the VNR preparation, the Ministry of Environment has brought together a large group of experts including specialists of numerous ministries and representatives of non-governmental organisations and municipalities. This working group has agreed on the structure and scope of the VNR and the preparation schedule, and appointed responsible focal points of the VNR. All responsible national authorities have undertaken to cooperate closely with non-governmental organisations in preparing the VNR.  
 
ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS OF IMPLEMENTATION  
 
Sustainable development is an excellent opportunity for humanity to aim at making progress in three important spheres that have a great influence on our lives. It is a way for implementing economic prosperity and social justice and enjoying a healthy environment. To ensure the compatibility and integration of these spheres, Lithuania has created an institutional basis and a strategic planning system resting on the principles of sustainable development. When preparing strategic documents of their respective spheres, all national authorities are guided by overarching strategies, in particular the National Strategy for Sustainable Development and Lithuaniais Progress Strategy \0xEBLithuania 2030i. This ensures the compatibility of different political areas and the integrated solution of problems.  
 
PARTNERSHIP AND ENGAGEMENT 
 
To achieve the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, a broad public engagement is required. It is highly important for Lithuania to enhance cooperation of state institutions, non-governmental organisations, business associations, the academic community and other stakeholder groups for the purpose of achieving the sustainable development goals. A broad cooperation network was developed when preparing this review. A competent expert group including various ministries, Statistics Lithuania and the Association of Local Authorities engaged non-governmental organisations and their associations in the group activities. A ministry in charge of an appropriate sustainable development goal consulted with business organisations and non-governmental organisations operating in that sector. The draft review was presented to the Economic and Social Council where employer associations and trade unions had an opportunity to submit their comments and proposals. Young specialists participating in the programme for professional development and the applicability of best foreign practices \0xEBCreate Lithuaniai, which enables young professionals to contribute towards shaping the future of modern Lithuania with their knowledge and ideas, were engaged in this process. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
END POVERTY IN ALL ITS FORMS EVERYWHERE 
 
 Goal 1 
 
Poverty and social exclusion, increasing income inequality and population ageing are big challenges for the social policy of Lithuania. 
In view of the arising challenges, the poverty reduction policy in Lithuania is one of the key priorities laid down in major national and international strategic documents. To reduce poverty by 2020, Lithuania has foreseen to develop active support forms promoting employment, apply regulatory and other measures for reducing income inequality, create flexible and safe employment relationships and increase population income, ensure equal opportunities to access social, health care, education, cultural and legal services and develop social entrepreneurship.  
In Lithuania, the share of people living below the international poverty threshold accounts for about 1%, and about one-fifth of the Lithuanian population is at risk of poverty (where at-risk-of-poverty threshold is 60% of median equalised disposable income) (Figure 1). In 2016, the share of the population subject to poverty risk or social exclusion was 30.1%, which was by 6.6 percentage point more than the European Union average.  
Figure 1 
 
Single persons, single-adult households with one and more children, disabled and elderly persons are persons who are at the highest risk of poverty in Lithuania. 
At-risk-of-poverty rate of children decreased by more than 3 percentage point in 2016. Nevertheless, this rate still remains fairly high in Lithuania (Figure 2).  
Another concern is the increasing at-risk-of-poverty rate of the disabled (persons whose activity was restricted for 6 months and longer due to health problems) and persons of 65 years of age and over, which in 2016 amounted to 30.6% and 27.7% respectively.  
These at-risk-of-poverty trends can be explained by the recovery of some economic sectors and the more rapid income growth in them, the social benefits that have not been increased for a long time and that have been losing their purchasing power, and the low spending on social security in comparison with other countries. Compared to 2010, the share of the government sector spending on the essential social security 

services dropped from 33.4% to 31.7%, while the share for social security had accounted for 14.8% of the countryis GDP in 2014 and 15.6% in 2015, i.e. almost twice less than the EU average (28.7% in 2014). 
Figure 2 
 
Therefore, Lithuania is carrying out significant reforms to help reduce poverty and social exclusion.  
With a view to ensuring the steady increase of retirement pensions in accordance with Lithuaniais economic indicators, the wage growth rate was taken into consideration in forming the 2018 budget of the State Social Insurance Fund Board, and retirement pensions have been indexed according to this rate since 1 January 2018. Social insurance pensions are expected to increase by about 7%. As a budget reserve of the Social Insurance Fund is built in the future (the appropriate laws on the budget reserve were passed in 2016), the issue of a more sizeable increase of pensions will have to be solved, as the level of retirement pensions is not high in Lithuania. The ratio of an average retirement pension to the countryis average wages is about 40% net. To improve the situation of elderly and disabled persons, however, the Government seeks to maintain the sustainability of the pension system as well for the reason that an unsustainable pension system inspires no confidence.  
A tool inseparable from poverty reduction is quality employment. Attempts are made to ensure sustainable integration of free labour resources in the labour market so that as many people as possible have employment and earn fair wages supporting a dignified life.  
Amended and supplemented in 2017, the Law on Employment will help individuals to acquire the desired qualifications with greater ease, increase employment opportunities and promote their involvement in lifelong learning processes. To ensure that their knowledge, skills and abilities are recognised officially, a new measure has been proposed which includes the recognition of competences acquired through nonformal and informal learning. Also, the support from the Labour Exchange, which in Lithuania implements bilateral and trilateral cooperation of social and labour market partners to promote employment, organises and implements measures to prevent unemployment and mitigate consequences of redundancies and monitors the labour market, is being enhanced in providing labour market services to persons who have lost the status of the unemployed due to infringements. Mobility support measures are enhanced, which involves compensation of travel costs to employers that hire unemployed persons sent by the Labour Exchange and incur the costs of transportation of the unemployed to the place of work, also granting more employment opportunities for the population of peripheral regions. 
In 2017, a new reference indicator for social security benefits n the amount of minimum consumption needs (AMCN) n was approved. This indicator is linked with the existing reference indicators for social security benefits which determine the amounts of social security benefits or the right to them, i.e. with the basic social benefit, the basis social assistance pensions, the basic social benefit and state-supported income. The AMCN will be calculated on an annual basis, and the above-mentioned social security benefits will increase depending on the growing annual inflation and prices of food and non-food products and services.  
The launch of an institutional care reform that is gaining momentum has been a step of particular importance. This reform will replace the long-standing Soviet system and create a system that is completely new for Lithuania. The institutional care reform will help to establish a system of integrated services which will make individual services available for each mentally disabled person or his/her relatives according to their needs in the community and ensure that each child left without parental care grows in a family or in an environment as close to the family as possible. 
As families with children suffer from poverty more often, Lithuania is creating better financial conditions for families that raise children. A child benefit of the same size has been introduced for all children, without checking the family property or income, and financial support is granted for adopting a child. Moreover, an additional child benefit is allocated and paid to families raising and/or taking care of one or two children if the monthly family income per capita is lower than 1.5 of the state-supported income, and to families than raise and/or take care of three or more children, without evaluating the family income.  
A great deal of attention is devoted to the timely provision of quality services. Since 2017 the funding for social work with at-risk families has been increased, which has reduced the number of at-risk families per social worker from 17 to 10.  
Social work with the parents of a child in care has been enhanced to provide conditions for the childis return to the family and increase the number of social workers in local municipalities working with families. Integrated assistance at home (social care and nursing) are extended to all municipalities. Integrated services for parents with children in a crisis are also being enhanced by developing the parentsi social and positive parenting skills and giving priority to the prevention of early family crises. 
A procedure is being drawn up to improve the living environment of families raising children with severe disabilities. It is planned to fund the adaptation of the housing interior, e.g. to adapt the sanitary facilities, broaden the doorways and fund the outdoor and living environment adaptation and improvements and the purchase of equipment. 
The provided services do not yet cover all social groups, and the NGO potential in providing social and integrated services could be exploited more in separate regions. As a result, the development of social services remains one of the most important tasks.  
Lithuaniais vision and main goal is to achieve that each person in Lithuania could live a dignified and secure life, have opportunities to work and earn an income, balance family and employment obligations, create and share, realise oneself and enjoy all social guarantees, and under difficult life conditions benefit from the necessary assistance. 
 
 END HUNGER, ACHIEVE FOOD SECURITY AND IMPROVED NUTRITION  AND PROMOTE SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE 
  Goal 2 
 
The implementation of the EU common agricultural policy contributes to achieving this goal. More than EUR 3 billion have been allocated for direct payments in 2014n2020, and the budget of the Lithuanian Rural Development Programme 2014n2020 constitutes almost EUR 2 billion. Direct payments are allocated to agricultural entities for the declared areas of agricultural holdings, crops and livestock, with a view to supporting income, ensuring the long-term economic vitality of farms less dependent on fluctuations of agricultural product prices. Launched in 2015, the Lithuanian Rural Development Programme 2014n2020 consists of various measures designed to promote the competitiveness of agriculture, protect the environment and conserve biodiversity, and improve the quality of life in rural areas. About 3 000 entities receive support for organic farming and the farming of fruit, berries and vegetables in accordance with the national agriculture and food quality system (support is provided to an area of more than 200 000 ha). With a focus on environmental protection and sustainable development, support is to be provided to 70 000 entities and their activities related to the promotion of environmentally friendly farming practices in areas containing natural handicaps.  
In 2016, the share of the agriculture, forestry and fisheries sector in the gross value added created in Lithuania and in the countryis total exports accounted for 3.3% and 19.4% respectively. Lithuanian exports of agricultural and food products constituted EUR 4.4 billion and imports amounted to EUR 3.4 billion. The foreign trade balance of agricultural and food products has been positive since 2004, and in 2016 it increased from EUR 87 million to EUR 977 million compared to 2015. 
Lithuania boasts the largest supply of grain, milk and dairies, eggs, meat and potatoes among all agricultural products. The production of these products normally exceeds the volume consumed for domestic needs. Opposite trends dominate in the vegetable, fruit and berry market, as these products are not sufficient to meet the domestic demand due to seasonality and climatic differences. 
The increase of labour productivity and innovation remain one of the challenges for the development of the agricultural and food sector. This need is dictated by increased competition on international markets. 
To make the nutrition of the population more balanced and favourable to health, Lithuania has approved and is currently implementing strategic planning and other normative documents that will help to improve the situation related to food, nutrition and health.  
The above-mentioned steps in the agricultural policy provide conditions for ensuring the economic vitality of farms and the food industry and the continuation of their activities, promoting conservation of the environment and meeting other public needs. Lithuania in fact is self-sufficient in terms of agricultural and food products, which guarantees the survival of the state. 
 
 ENSURE HEALTHY LIVES AND PROMOTE WELL-BEING FOR ALL AT ALL  AGES  
  Goal 3 
 
Health is a human asset and the basis of life which has to be sufficiently firm to allow us solving everyday issues and overcoming new social and economic challenges with success. Public health is a national asset and capital protecting and fostering which is the main goal of a state that ensures a countryis social and economic development. Healthy and working people are a guarantor of economic growth and sustainable development of a country.  
Scientific research has proven and international strategic documents have stated that unhealthy lifestyles, i.e. unbalanced nutrition, low physical activity, obesity, constant nervous tension, smoking, abuse of alcoholic beverages, etc., are the main risk factors of non-communicable diseases (hereinafter n \0xEBNCDsi) such as circulatory system diseases, malignant tumours and diabetes that account for the largest share of the mortality rate among the Lithuanian population. An individualis development and the manifestation of risk factors are greatly influenced by his or her nutrition in childhood, especially in the first year of life. To lay a firm basis, infants must be exclusively breastfed for at least 6 months. The Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative of the World Health Organization (hereinafter \0xEBWHOi) and the United Nations Childrenis Emergency Fund (UNICEF) is one of the effective ways to improve the health of mother and child by promoting breastfeeding. Lithuania launched the implementation of the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative in 1993. The aim of this initiative is to step up efforts for all hospitals to apply practices that protect, promote and support breastfeeding. To make the nutrition of the Lithuanian population more balanced and favourable to health, Lithuania is currently implementing measures provided for in strategic planning and other normative documents that help to improve the situation related to food, nutrition and health. For example, a procedure for organising healthy nutrition was introduced at child education and care institutions of all levels in 2011 and has been upgraded ever since. The procedure has led to prevent a supply of foodstuffs and beverages detrimental to childrenis health. A ban has been imposed (for the first time in world practice) on the sale of energy drinks to children and their advertising at childrenis institutions and events and in childrenis publications. An order of the Minister of Health has been approved and notified to the European Commission concerning the establishment of a strict limit of trans fats harmful to health in all food products, and the supply of products containing trans fats to childrenis institutions has been banned. Lithuania is the fifth European Union member state to have introduced such a limit. A system of labelling healthier food options with a \0xEBKeyHolei symbol has been introduced and currently has over 200 such food products on the market. These products as well as organic products and products made in accordance with the national quality system have been designated as priorities in organising public procurement of foodstuffs and raw materials for childrenis educational institutions. Every year the public health bureaus organise several thousand events on the promotion of healthy nutrition, part of which take place in childrenis communities. 
The hospital mortality rate has decreased since 2014 due to the activities of newly established specialised treatment centres (e.g. of integrated myocardial infarction and haemorrhagic stroke health care services). Lithuania is implementing the National Cancer Prevention and Control Programme 2014n2025 and oncological disease screening programmes designed for cervical cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer and programme of early diagnosis of prostate cancer. 
Mental health enhancement and mental disorder prevention are vital factors for the individual, family, community and whole society. One of the most important indicators reflecting the public mental health condition is the suicide rate. To coordinate suicide prevention and enhance interinstitutional cooperation, in 2015 the National Centre for Mental Health established a Suicide Prevention Office. The establishment of a network of mental health centres, psychiatric day care centres and crisis intervention centres has resulted in the increased availability of personal health care services. Psychiatric services for children and adolescents are being developed. Measures implemented in 2018 to prevent alcohol consumption include a ban on alcohol advertising, shorter hours of trade in alcohol, the increase of the age for buying, possessing and consuming alcohol up to 20 years, limited points of sale, and other regulatory measures adopted and applied to restrict alcohol supply and demand. Annual legal alcohol consumption per capita was falling steadily from 2012 to 2016 (the value changed from 12.6 litres to 11.3 litres per capita annually). Lithuania has established a National Fund for Public Health Enhancement with alcohol consumption and suicide prevention being one of its priorities, and has begun providing early intervention, early alcohol consumption risk identification and psychotherapy services. 
The key tasks for enhancing physical and mental health and shaping a healthy lifestyle and its culture are as follows: 
o Disseminating information based on scientific evidence about healthy nutrition and lifestyles by organising training for different population groups, especially for children, pregnant women, nursing mothers and individuals in NCD risk groups, and publishing social advertisements; 
o Increasing the share of healthy foodstuffs (with a low content of saturated fats, trans fatty acid isomers, sugar and salt and higher quantities of fibres) on the market, enhancing their availability and recognisability, changing the composition of other foodstuffs accordingly and applying economic measures to promote healthier choices; 
o Promoting the exclusive breastfeeding of infants up to 6 months, and mitigating the effect of the marketing of unhealthy food products targeted at children; 
o Informing all population groups about the benefit of physical activity for health by providing knowledge based on scientific evidence and raising public awareness about the physical activity that enhances health; 
o Implementing integrated national suicide prevention by raising awareness of various sectors, departments, organisations, the public, politicians and media representatives about this problem and the possibilities of effective activities, with a focus on increased suicide risk groups; 
o Promoting the dissemination of positive information to the public, increasing public awareness of the possibilities to enhance mental health and prevent mental diseases, and promoting public involvement; 
o Developing preventive activities to enhance mental health at educational establishments, by devoting particular attention to the formation of life skills, the learning of constructive behaviour patterns in conflict situations, the solution of bullying and violence problems and the implementation of healthy lifestyle and social and emotional education. 
The sustainability of the public health care system in present-day society is a very important goal of the public health policy. It relies on a holistic approach to health and seeks new, quality, accessible and evidence-based forms of service provision and cooperation that meet public needs, help to prepare for and control potential public health risks, and use resources in a rational way. The Lithuanian population is ageing rapidly, its every fifth inhabitant being older than 60 years of age. Health imbalances between the urban and rural population are increasing. The growing NCD morbidity among the ageing population boosts the need for health care and the expenses for the health sector, and demand for new public health services is emerging. To enhance the availability of primary health care, the number of family doctors per 10 000 of the population has been enlarged (7.4 family doctors per 10 000 inhabitants in 2016).  
The ten-year trend of sexually transmitted disease morbidity has shown a downward dynamic in Lithuania, but syphilis morbidity was 1.6 times higher than the EU average in 2011. During the last five years (2010n 2014), chlamydiosis morbidity went up by a third. If untreated, this disease can become the cause of infertility. Most persons infected with sexually transmitted diseases are young people between 20 and 34 years of age. The spread of sexually transmitted diseases is related to the perilous sexual behaviour. The number of persons infected with AIDS through sexual relations is on the rise every year, while the number of those infected through the use of injectable narcotic drugs is decreasing. More and more women get infected. AIDS detection is constantly improving. The number of AIDS tests carried out in recent years has increased by 20%. To implement the recommendations of international organisations, however, the availability of AIDS tests is extended to all levels of health care. The application of the most recent guidance on AIDS treatment has been ensured in Lithuania. AIDS treatment becomes AIDS prevention. The main challenge is the increased spread of AIDS infection at places of detention and the inadequate antiretroviral therapy coverage (29.8%) of persons diagnosed with AIDS. In 2018, the treatment of all AIDS infected persons has started immediately after diagnosing the disease (until now the beginning of treatment depended on the test results).  
Tuberculosis morbidity in relatively high in Lithuania. The main cause is the delayed arrival at personal health care institutions, so offices of directly monitored treatment are being established. Procedures for the enhancement of the quality and availability of tuberculosis prevention, diagnostics and treatment and the provision of monitored short treatment course services have been approved. Medicines for the treatment of tuberculosis are procured under a centralised procedure, are paid for by the Compulsory Health Insurance Fund and are distributed to patients free of charge. Acute viral hepatitis B morbidity is decreasing in Lithuania. 
Each year communicable disease morbidity accounts for 10% to 20% of all registered communicable diseases in the total morbidity structure of the Lithuanian population. According to the WHO information, vaccination is the most successful and cost-effective public health intervention in combatting communicable diseases. To be able to continue the control of communicable diseases, in 2018 the childrenis preventive vaccination schedule has been extended to include the rotavirus and B type meningococcal vaccines. 
In recent years, the WHO has adopted several strategic documents identifying the problem of antimicrobial resistance as one of the key threats to public health. Overall consumption of antimicrobial preparations in Lithuania is close to the European average, but the situation in the outpatient and inpatient sectors greatly differs (in the inpatient sector, this indicator is among the largest ones in the EU). 
Lithuania stands out by the great antibiotics consumption imbalances in the regions and different personal health care institutions, the increased consumption of a wide spectrum of antibiotics, fairly high selfmedication indicators and the low level of public knowledge on antimicrobial resistance and antibiotics. 
The Lithuanian compulsory health insurance system ensures the universal coverage of health care. The Law on Health Insurance stipulates that all permanent residents of Lithuania and foreign nationals temporarily residing or working in Lithuania, as well as minor members of their families must participate in this system and pay health insurance contributions, and upon occurrence of an insured event they are entitled to personal health care services paid for by the Compulsory Health Insurance Fund. The socially sensitive groups (children, unemployed persons, pensioners, etc.) defined in the Law are provided with compulsory health insurance with the funds of the state.  
The key tasks for enhancing the availability of quality and satisfactory public health care services are as follows:  
o Developing and introducing integrated health care service models that cover the provision of personal and public health care services; 
o Analysing and assessing possibilities for providing new public health care services that meet the present-day needs of the population, increasing the diversity of services and promoting cooperation among pharmacists, social workers and other stakeholders in the sphere of noncommunicable disease prevention. 
 
 ENSURE INCLUSIVE AND EQUITABLE QUALITY EDUCATION AND  PROMOTE LIFELONG LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL 
  Goal 4 
 
With a view to ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education, Lithuania is increasing the availability and quality of pre-school and pre-primary education and focusing on means to ensure the quality of general education, enhancing student achievements and developing inclusive education.  
Although the availability of pre-school and pre-primary education is improving in Lithuania, a fairly large difference yet remains between urban and rural areas: the share of children between 4 and 6 years of age who attended educational establishments in 2016 accounted for 91.4% (of which 48.4% in rural areas) (86.5% in 2012, of which 38.3% in rural areas). This situation was influenced by the establishment of new groups of pre-school and pre-primary education and the introduction of compulsory pre-primary education for all 6-year-old children from September 2016.  
To achieve even greater participation of children in pre-school and pre-primary education, the amendments to the Law on Education adopted in 2017 have laid down the possibility for learning under the pre-primary education programme from the age of 5 years, and under the primary education programme from the age of 6 years. The new provisions also foresee enhancing the availability of quality education, developing and applying a quality assessment system, especially in rural areas, modernising educational establishments and supplying them with special-purpose vehicles (in 2016, the share of children in pre-primary education commuting by yellow buses increased from 47% to 53%).  
In 2016n2017, the results of three international surveys of student achievements and adult skills, Lithuania being one of the participants, were published. The PISA results show that the achievements of Lithuaniais 15-year-olds are below the EU average. As seen from the financial literacy test, the achievements of the Lithuanian students were particularly low and Lithuania took the 11th and 12th places among the 15 participating countries. 
The surveys have disclosed marked differences of student achievements between different regions of the country, rural and urban areas and schools with different languages of instruction. The relevant problems include lower learning outcomes among boys (girls excelled boys by 39 points in their reading skills, which is equivalent to about one-year result of learning, and by 7 points in their natural science literacy, while the results of mathematical literacy were similar) and the great impact of the social, economic and cultural context on student achievements. 
Figure 3 
 
To enhance the student learning motivation and achievements, in 2016 the Lithuanian language and literature programmes for primary and general education common for all ethnic communities of Lithuania were approved and the number of learning days was increased. The introduction of a non-formal education basket in 2015 also resulted in the improved availability of non-formal education. More than a half of students from general education schools (55.8%) had an opportunity to participate in non-formal education in 2016. 
The educational programmes are to be reviewed and updated in 2018n2020 to integrate the themes of sustainable development, creativity, entrepreneurship, financial literacy, cooperative problem solving, natural sciences and other themes, introduce a methodology for individual student progress assessment, revise the examination system, etc. For the purpose of ensuring child welfare, reducing social exclusion and enhancing student achievements, it is planned to develop and implement a full-day school model that allows organising childrenis involvement and education at school all day long. Psychological assistance is being developed to ensure studentsi security and enhance their mental health. Funds amounting to EUR 3.8 million have been allocated for this purpose in 2018n2019. Psychological assistance will be provided at 700 schools and 18 pedagogical/educational assistance services. Also, additional 195.3 jobs for psychologists have been created, and 33 municipalities have been supplied with psychological assistance services. 
The number of computers at general education schools is on the rise, and the amount of interactive boards has doubled over the four years. According to studies, however, in Lithuania laboratory facilities are only available for 2% of fourth formers (the countriesi average is 38%) and 11% of eighth formers (the countriesi average is 85%) for learning natural sciences. To improve the learning environment and equipment of schools, in 2019 means, equipment and natural science laboratories will be provided to schools that are implementing the primary and general education programmes. 
In developing inclusive education, more efficient assistance will be provided for the individual progress of persons with disabilities and special learning needs. Lithuania seeks to make the general schools more attractive and ready to accept children with disabilities and special learning needs who currently are educated at special schools: jobs for assistant teachers are established, possibilities for allocating larger funds are reviewed, schools are encouraged to adapt the physical environment to the universal design requirements, pedagogical workers undergo training, and schools are supplied with the required teaching aids. Since 1 September 2017, the administrations of 55 municipalities have established positions of interinstitutional cooperation coordinators whose main purpose is to take care of the development of education assistance and social and health services for children and their parents, and to reduce the negative effect of the social and economic context on the childrenis learning achievements and personal development. Despite the attempts to lower the share of children learning at special schools, the situation has not improved since 2012 (the share of children learning at special schools accounted for 0.99% in 2012 and 1.1% in 2016). The number of vocational schools implementing vocational training programmes customised for the disabled (about one-third) is increasing in Lithuania. However, the share of persons with disabilities at vocational schools is very small and it has changed slightly (this share was 2.47% in 2012 and 2.84% in 2016). The situation at higher education establishments is similar (0.54% in 2012 and 0.55% in 2016). Social scholarships are granted to students and, to improve the availability of studies, successful students also offered an opportunity to receive targeted payments. 
In view of the existing situation, it is planned to increase the funding for the development of childrenis non-formal education (to ensure the inclusion of children with disabilities), establish a network of joint schools with special education divisions and draw up qualification development programmes for teachers aimed at the provision of individual assistance for the education of children with special needs in classes. There are also plans to create and implement a mechanism for the provision of services designed for the development of activities that promote lifelong learning and professional career planning, by devoting particularly great attention to the disabled and foreseeing their possibilities, adapt the physical and information environment of vocational schools to the disabled and modernise the student social support system. 
According to studies, a large portion of Lithuanian adults failed to attain higher levels of problem solving skills using IT (the highest levels (2 and 3) were only attained by 17.6% of adults, while the OECD average is 31. 1%). Considering the study data, the adult training cycle will be continued in the regions, the digital learning programmes will be updated and the availability and supply of learning services in municipalities will be enlarged.  
Since 2012 the number of teachers with high-level qualifications in the category of methodologists or experts has increased in the pre-school, pre-primary, general education and vocational training programmes. The share of teachers participating in international programmes increased in 2016. To enhance the qualification of teachers, different training on global education are organised, plans of integrated civic education and integrated sustainable development programmes for classes on various subjects have been prepared, the event \0xEBSchool 2015 n Developing global citizenship through the use of the mediai has been organised, and posters for schools have been published to introduce the UN 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.  
During the last five years, the number of students learning at vocational schools under the primary vocational programmes has increased by 6%. Also, positive moves have been observed in the sphere of lifelong learning (the level of lifelong learning in 25n64 age group has been rising gradually, and in 2016 it reached 6% (5.7% in 2012). However, large disparities between urban and rural populations still remain n the level of lifelong learning in rural areas has been especially low (3.7% in 2016). In addition, vocational schools continue to be unpopular with persons seeking upper-secondary education.  
According to the 2016 statistics, the Lithuanian population is among the most educated populations of the European Union. In 2016, the share of 20n24-year persons with at least secondary education amounted to 91.7% (the European Union average is 83.2%). Lithuania ranks third in the European Union according to this indicator. The shares of women and men differ slightly (in 2016, men accounted for 89.3% and women for 94.2%). Since 2011 Lithuania has been the leader among the European Union member states in terms of persons aged 25 to 64 with secondary or higher education. We are also in the first place among the European Union member states according to the number of 30n34-year-old people with higher education. However, there is still some gender inequality in higher education as women account for a considerably larger share of graduates than men do (in 2016, men made up 47.9% of all graduates of higher educational establishments).  
To provide more favourable conditions for quality higher education, it is planned to reform the network of higher educational establishments by modifying the model of funding, channelling European Union investments into the formation of high quality standards. In 2018, free Bachelor studies are to be introduced, and a model of funding the studies of Lithuanian citizens at the worldis best higher schools is to be developed and launched. 
Lithuania provides development cooperation assistance by granting scholarships to citizens from developing countries for second-cycle full-time studies and part-time studies at Lithuaniais higher educational establishments (in 2017, the support constituted EUR 177 627.70). The largest share of this support went to students from Ukraine (113 students), Georgia (42 students) and Azerbaijan (20 students). 
 
ACHIEVE GENDER EQUALITY AND EMPOWER ALL WOMEN AND GIRLS 
 
  Goal 5 
 
Lithuania has a legal basis in place required to promote, implement and control the equality between men and women and non-discrimination based on gender, and is implementing an appropriate policy. 
In 1995, Lithuania ratified the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, and in 2004 the Optional Protocol to the Convention. In its concluding observations on the fifth periodic report of Lithuania presented to Lithuania in 2014, the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women positively assessed Lithuaniais efforts to improve the institutional and political system with a view to speeding up the elimination of discrimination against women and promoting gender equality. Lithuania is drawing up its sixth periodic report on the implementation of the Convention to be presented to the United Nations in July 2018. Lithuania has consistently implemented the goals of the United Nations strategic document n the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action n in all 12 critical areas of concern and has submitted reports on the implementation of these goals every four years.  
The Law on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men of the Republic of Lithuania is the main national law that implements the equal opportunities for all persons regardless of their gender as laid down in the Constitution of the Republic of Lithuania. This Law is aimed at ensuring that equal opportunities are provided for women and men and a ban is imposed on direct and indirect discrimination, harassment based on gender and sexual harassment, and any instruction for direct or indirect discrimination based on gender. The Law lays down the obligation for national and municipal authorities and offices, employers or employeris representatives, educational establishments, research and study institution, sellers and producers of goods or service providers to implement equal rights between women and men. The Law prohibits any discrimination of persons based on gender by establishing and applying social security provisions, or any discrimination of persons due to gender based on their membership and participation in organisations of employees or employers or in other organisations. The person in charge of the supervision of the Law on Equal Opportunities for women and men is the Equal Opportunities Ombudsman whose work is ensured by the Office of the Equal Opportunities Ombudsman. 
Lithuania has adopted the Law on Protection against Domestic Violence aimed at protecting persons against domestic violence. This Law defines the concept of domestic violence, lays down the rights and liability of subjects of domestic violence, implementation of prevention measures, provision of assistance in the event of domestic violence and application of protection measures to victims of violence. In accordance with the Law, the National Programme for the Prevention of Domestic Violence and Provision of Assistance to victims for the period of 2014-2020 has been prepared and approved. The Programme is aimed at reducing the level of domestic violence. To implement this Programme, training is organised for specialists who provide assistance to victims of violence, funds are allocated to NGOs working with persons who seek to abandon violent behaviour and carrying out domestic violence prevention, and various information activities and public opinion surveys are conducted. A network of specialised assistance centres operates in the sphere of assistance to victims of domestic violence. In 2017, assistance at specialised centres was provided to a total of 11 600 persons (of which 9 300 were women and 1 600 were men, and more than 600 children; also, the victims of violence who benefited from assistance included 507 disabled persons). The specialised assistance centres are funded on a project basis, and this funding has been increasing steadily during the recent years. 
In February 2017, Lithuania approved the recommendations received in the second cycle of the Universal Periodic Review of the UN Human Rights Council to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (EC Istanbul Convention). In 
September 2017, the Prime Minister of the Republic of Lithuania directed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to prepare draft legal acts on the ratification of the Convention.  
Lithuania ensures equal opportunities between women and men to participate in the labour market and promotes the equal sharing of domestic responsibilities. Lithuaniais national legislation lays down the principle of equal pay to women and men for the same work or for work of equivalent value.  
In accordance with the Labour Code, employers are obligated to implement the principles of gender equality and non-discrimination on other bases. In the hiring process, women and men are subject to equal selection criteria; they have the same working conditions and should receive equal payment for the same work or for work of equivalent value. Where the number of employees exceeds 50, measures for implementing the equal opportunity policy have to be adopted. According to the wage statistics, in 2016 gender pay gap accounted for 14.4%, i.e. it was below the European Union average. Eliminating the gender pay gap remains a key task in pursuing the common goal of gender equality. 
Lithuania provides equal conditions for either parent to go on parental leave until a child reaches the age of 3 years. This leave is available not only to a childis parents but also to his or her grandmother or grandfather. Such conditions allow a woman to return to the labour market or remain in it with less negative consequences for her careers. Women can choose a part-time job and simultaneously receive a child benefit. A maternity (paternity) allowance can be paid until a child reaches the age of one or two years. If an allowance is chosen until a child reaches the age of one year, wages are compensated 100%. In case the two-year option is chosen, compensation in the first and second years equals 70% and 40% of wages respectively.  
With a view to enhancing womenis leadership and participation in decision-making, leadership events and training are organised and support is provided to the activities of clubs of women politicians. In 2017, the Ministry of Social Security and Labour organised a conference on womenis leadership in society and business called \0xEBCherchez la Femme n Look for the Womani aimed at achieving a balanced participation of women and men in decision-making and high-ranking positions, promoting womenis motivation and creating an environment favourable for careers. The event gave an opportunity for representatives of business, politics, culture, sports and the public sector to share good practice, success stories and problems and challenges in combining a career with personal life. The conference on the promotion of womenis entrepreneurship \0xEBEntrepreneurial. Smart. Sociali held by the Ministry of Economy in cooperation with the Enterprise Lithuania (a non-profit agency under Ministry of Economy) was aimed at introducing women to opportunities of social business. In 2016, Enterprise Lithuania organised seven free events in the regions on the promotion of womenis entrepreneurship. The events also included mentoring sessions n meetings with experienced entrepreneurs and professionals of different spheres.  
In Lithuania, the reproductive health services are integrated in the health care system, and the issues assigned to this sphere (primary health care, safe maternity, infant and child health, family planning, abortion prevention, containment of the spread of AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases, and prevention of cervical and breast cancer) have been included in respective programmes or services. The reproductive health related services of family doctors and obstetricians gynaecologists engaged in primary health care are free of charge and are available for all insured patients. A family doctor or an obstetrician gynaecologist can provide information on various reproductive health questions. Pregnancy termination in Lithuania is regulated by an order of the Minister of Health. A woman wishing to terminate pregnancy is allowed to do that up to the 12th week of pregnancy. Pregnancy of more than 12 weeks can be terminated if it represents a risk to a womanis life or health. In all cases pregnancy termination requires a womanis consent (the spouseis consent is also desirable). Where pregnancy is terminated in minors under the age of 16 years, a written consent of either parent, adoptive parent, carer, guardian or persons actually raising them is compulsory, and for a woman between the ages of 16 and 18 such a consent is desirable.  
In accordance with Lithuanian legislation, men and women have equal opportunities in terms of natural resources, ownership, financial services and inheritance. Equal opportunities are established for all persons to purchase, inherit and manage land regardless of their gender. The same provisions apply also to the opportunities to benefit from financial support under various support systems in the agricultural sector.  
With a view to solving the problems of equality between women and men in a consistent, integrated and systematic manner, the National Programme on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men 2015n2021 is being implemented and specialised programmes for different spheres, e.g. reduction of violence, are being affected. The goals of the Programme on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men are to promote equal opportunities for women and men in the employment and labour sectors, seek a balanced participation between women and men in economic and political decision-making, enhance the efficiency of institutional mechanisms for the equality between women and men, promote the integration of the gender aspect in the spheres of availability of education and science, culture, health care, the environment, national defence and justice. To achieve the programme goals, targets have been set forth that are closely related to Goal 5 of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development n promote womenis motivation and abilities to participate in decision-making, create an environment favourable for womenis careers, support an information portal for women, implement activities promoting womenis leadership, educate society on reproduction health issues, and raise awareness of society, especially of rural women, on remedies, etc. In implementing the Programme, support is granted to projects of non-governmental organisations, training is organised for civil servants, representatives of the judicial system and social partners, information campaigns and the selection of the most equal employer, most equal municipality are conducted, and the functioning of the electronic network of womenis organisations and the information portal www.lygus.lt is ensured.  
 
 ENSURE AVAILABILITY AND SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT OF WATER  AND SANITATION FOR ALL 
  Goal 6 
 
Drinking water used in Lithuania is exclusively ground water with a potential of approximately 3.2 million cubic metres per day. The forecast is that by 2025 the daily demand for groundwater may increase by 0.9 to 1 million cubic metres. It is also expected that the water supplies will stay adequate during the coming 20 years. The greater part of the groundwater resources used in Lithuania is of good quality.  
Drinking water supply and wastewater management are services of common interest that determine the quality of citizensi life and of the environment. These services have to meet the established safety and quality requirements and be affordable, and the main cost recovery and \0xEBpolluter paysi principles applied have to be implemented.  
In 2000n2013, the water management sector received investments of EUR 0.84 billion from the European Union funds. Some 3 000 kilometres of new wastewater collection networks and 2 200 kilometres of new water supply networks were built in that period to implement the goal of increasing the availability of publicly supplied drinking water and wastewater management services. 
 
 
 
 
Figure 4 
 
In 2015, drinking water supplied by a centralised system in Lithuania was used by 80% of the population, and wastewater of 72% of the population was collected in centralised sewer systems. According to the information of the Environmental Project Management Agency under the Ministry of Environment of the Republic of Lithuania, based on the programmes for the financial periods 2004n2006 and 2007n2013, by April 2015 the number of users of the wastewater collection networks had increase by 171 000 residents and that of users of the drinking water supply networks by 123 000 residents (the share of the population using centralised wastewater collection networks and drinking water supply networks had increased by 5.7% and 4% respectively).  
One more goal in the water management sector is to achieve 100% compliance of publicly supplied drinking water with the safety and quality requirements. In 2014, the laboratory of the State Food and Veterinary Service carried out a total of 1 235 chemical, microbiological, organoleptic and radiological tests of drinking water where the results of about 87% of the tests met the statutory requirements. Moreover, according to the 2016 assessment by the European Commission, Lithuania has achieved a very high level of compliance (99n100%) to the microbiological and chemical parameters set forth in the Drinking Water Directive. The data of drinking water quality control show that the situation in the publicly supplied drinking water sector is improving. However, still relevant are the problems of drinking water safety and quality, such as the increased fluoride and boron content in publicly supplied drinking water in Lithuaniais north-western part, increased levels of other indicators (manganese, sulphates and chloride) and higher turbidity (in the drinking water supplied by small water extraction sites). 
Since 2000, the Lithuanian water management sector has made the greatest progress in the sphere of wastewater treatment. Wastewater management projects are being implemented, which leads to the steady decrease in the quantity of untreated wastewater in Lithuania. In 2010n2015, 90% of all collected wastewater on average was treated to the established standard (21% of wastewater in 2002). State-ofthe-art wastewater treatment plants have reduced environmental emissions of pollutants. Although the decrease of the total volume of wastewater was slight, from 2007 to 2015 the quantities of organic pollutants and nitrogen and phosphorus compounds that cause algae blooms in surface water bodies were lower in wastewater discharges by 65 %, 33 % and 54.5 % respectively.  
Lithuanian laws lay down the principle of cost recovery, which means that the prices of the drinking water supply and wastewater management services have to cover the costs necessary to provide these services, ensure the long-term operation, renovation and development of drinking water supply and wastewater management infrastructure, create satisfactory conditions for subscribing users and users to use drinking water and have access to wastewater management services of appropriate quality, reduce environmental pollution and use water resources in a rational way.  
It can be maintained in conclusion that the majority of the Lithuanian population use quality water from the centralised supply system and that great progress is observed in the wastewater treatment sector. As for the future outlook, the Water Sector Development Programme 2017n2023 provides for further development and renovation of drinking water supply and wastewater collection infrastructure, reduction of environmental pollution with wastewater, enhancement of the performance of drinking water supply and wastewater management undertakings and improvement of the quality of provided services. With a view to ensuring long-term sustainability of the drinking water supply and wastewater management sector, it is planned to implement the cost recovery principle to the full extent. In 2019, amendments to the Law on Drinking Water Supply and Wastewater management will be drawn up to lay down a model for the consolidation of undertakings and a procedure for its implementation.  
 
 ENSURE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE, RELIABLE, SUSTAINABLE AND  MODERN ENERGY FOR ALL 
  Goal 7 
 
In the process of executing the National Energy Independence Strategy (NEIS) approved in 2012, the projects implemented in Lithuania have diversified the ways and sources of energy supply, reduced energy resource prices for consumers and opened up new opportunities for the development of the country. Among such projects are the liquefied natural gas terminal built in Lithuaniais sea port Klaip?da at the end of 2014 and the intersystem power links Lithuania-Sweden (NordBalt) and Lithuania-Poland (LitPol Link) put into operation at the end of 2015. 
To continue enhancing the security of energy supply, the reliability of the electricity distribution network and its resistance to the impacts of meteorological phenomena, Lithuania new electricity distribution networkis lines will be built only as underground cables. 
Lithuania achieved the target of 23% of energy from renewable energy sources (RES) in the gross final consumption of energy in the country already in 2014, which it had committed to ensure by 2020. In 2016, this share accounted for 25.5%, and the percentage of electricity from RES in the gross electricity consumption amounted to 17%. The share of heating produced from RES in 2016 reached 46% (64% in the district heating system), and RES in the transport sector equalled 4%. Wind and biofuel energy account for a significant share in Lithuaniais overall energy production. 
Energy efficiency improvement is one of the key goals of Lithuania. Energy efficiency is usually measured as the intensity of primary and final energy which shows units of energy used for the production of a particular quantity of goods and services in a country (the ratio of a countryis energy consumption to GDP). In 2010n2015, the energy intensity of the Lithuanian economy declined steadily (32% of primary energy and 31% of final energy) and in 2015 it reached 205 kgoe/EUR 1000. However, Lithuania still lags behind (about 70%) from the European Union average (120 kgoe/EUR 1000). The economic feasibility of energy efficiency measures shows that the largest potential for energy efficiency improvement lies in the industry, housing and transport sectors. 
The renewed NEIS lays down Lithuaniais essential goals in the energy sector for 2020 and 2030, and a vision for 2050. The greatest attention is devoted to RES and energy efficiency; ambitious targets are set in these spheres and main policy directions to achieve them are also provided. 
The main objective of the Strategy in the RES sphere is to continue increasing the share of RES in Lithuaniais domestic energy production and gross final consumption, this way reducing the dependence on fossil fuel imports and enhancing the capacity of domestic electricity production. 
Although the RES technologies are being constantly upgraded and the price of equipment is falling, energy from RES generated in new installations presently cannot compete in the energy market. Therefore energy production from RES is being promoted, and this practice will continue up to the RES development limit that is economically and technically acceptable for the country, focusing on the active participation of RES energy producers under market conditions or until energy production from RES reaches the market price. 
To implement the strategic RES target, Lithuania will seek to increase the RES share, compared to the countryis gross final consumption. It is planned that by 2020 RES will account for 30%, by 2030 for 45% and by 2050 for 80%, which means that energy from RES will be the leader in the electricity, heating and cooling and transport sectors. 
It is expected that in the long-term electricity consumers will become active market participants. They will receive an opportunity to use energy from RES for their own needs and earn a compensation consistent with the market conditions for surplus energy supplied to the grid. The share of such consumers will constitute at least 30% by 2030, compared to the total number of consumers, and not less than 50% by 2050. These consumers will be granted an opportunity to participate in the market through energy sector service providers. The active involvement of local energy communities in investments in RES installations of joint ownership will be promoted. 
In the energy efficiency improvement field, the plan is to ensure that by 2030 the intensity of primary and final energy is 1.5 times lower than in 2017, and 2.4 times lower by 2050, compared to 2017. These targets should be achieved through comprehensive renovation of multi-apartment and public buildings (giving priority to quartered renovation). By 2020 energy savings in renovated multi-apartment and public buildings (an aggregate of annual savings) are expected to amount to 2.6n3 TWh, and by 2030 to 5n6 TWh. It is also planned to rapidly develop low-energy industrial sectors with improved energy efficiency, and install and purchase state-of-the-art and environmentally friendly technologies and equipment. In addition, the plan includes improving energy efficiency in the transport sector through the renewal of the car fleet, transition to modern and efficient public transport, optimisation of the transport and alternative fuel use infrastructure, electrification of this infrastructure and use of alternative fuels.

Lithuania is annually faced with a situation where the electricity supply to the population is interrupted for meteorological reasons. Such interruptions are most often determined by the fact that the greater part of the power distribution network in Lithuania consists of overhead power lines. For this reason, new power distribution lines to be built will only be cable lines if economically justified. Worn-out power distribution lines will also be replaced with cable lines, with priority given to the age and accident rate of lines and to wooded and economically used territories. Through the application of state-of-the-art technologies of a smart power grid and a rational replacement of the distribution network overhead power lines with cable power lines, Lithuania will seek to improve the reliability indicators of the distribution network operator by at least 25% by 2020 and 50% by 2030, compared to 2017 levels, and by 2050 to achieve that its distribution network operator ranks among the EUis best distribution network operators in terms of reliability indicators.  
The existing energy sector achievements and plans of the Lithuanian energy sector laid down in the renewed NEIS show that Lithuania is focused on reducing the adverse effect of energy production and use on the environment. The country is determined to shift towards a sustainable and low-carbon economy, which is to be achieved by changing the energy production practices, rapidly increasing the share of RES in energy production and improving energy efficiency. In addition, Lithuania seeks to further enhance the safety and reliability of energy supply. 
 
 PROMOTE SUSTAINED, INCLUSIVE AND SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH,  FULL AND PRODUCTIVE EMPLOYMENT AND DECENT WORK FOR ALL 
  Goal 8 
 
Lithuania has shown annual growth of general domestic product (hereinafter \0xEBGDPi) per worker. Taking economic growth into consideration, in 2010n2015 this indicator changed from 1.0% to 3.6%, and the largest growth was observed in 2011 (8.5%). In view of sustainable economic growth, GDP growth per person employed is observed. The growth rate of gross value added (hereinafter \0xEBGVAi) created in Lithuania per person employed was falling from 2010 to 2016.

Lithuaniais annual average consumption of resources amounts to 42 million tonnes. To improve and promote the efficient use of resources, Lithuania applies financial incentives to companies which promote resource efficiency, avoidance of waste, industrial symbiosis and training of required professionals. 
The National Industry Digitalisation Platform \0xEBIndustry 4.0i established on the initiative of the Ministry of Economy and industry representatives will contribute to the more rapid growth of GVA created in the industry sector and the promotion of digital processes in industry, and will also help to ensure the increased competitiveness of Lithuanian industry at international level and more rapid growth of Lithuanian economy. In accordance with the Government Programme of the Republic of Lithuania, the Ministry of Economy plans to approve the financial measure \0xEBDigitalisation of Industry LTi in 2018 Q2, and to issue the first call for applications. Under this measure, support will be provided to technology audits that would help to identify the need for modernisation and problem areas at micro-, small and mediumsized industrial enterprises of Lithuania, and to the introduction of digital technologies in such enterprises. A strategic implementation action plan is to be prepared for the National Industry Digitalisation Initiative. 
With a view to combating discrimination and establishing human rights in the labour market and business, it is planned to draw up the second national action plan on business and human rights in 2018 following the guidelines of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and the United Nations. 
During the recent six years the Lithuanian labour market has shown an upward trend in employment and a downward trend in unemployment among all age groups of the population. In 2016, the employment rate of the population aged 15n64 accounted for 69.4% and it increased by 2.2% over the year. In the 15n64year-age group, the unemployment rate of men in 2016 went up by 2% to 7.0%, and the employment rate of women increased by 2.3% to 68.8%. In the age group of 55n64 years, the employment rate climbed by 4.2% to 64.6% in 2016.

By promoting entrepreneurship and employment in territories with the highest unemployment rate, the Lithuanian Labour Exchange has been implementing projects of the Locals Employment Initiatives (hereinafter \0xEBLEIi) for fifteen years. Over the whole 2001n2015 period of implementation of projects under the Locals Employment Initiatives, Lithuania implemented almost a thousand LEI projects and created nearly 5 400 new jobs.  
In view of the ageing population, the lack of qualified workers and the shrinking potential of the countryis labour force due to emigration, Lithuania seeks to mobilise Lithuanian residents of working age, promote their active participation in economic activities, integrate them into the labour market and ensure they stay there as long as possible. The activity level of the labour force has continued to grow, which has had a favourable effect on Lithuaniais labour market. However, it has failed to offset the impact of the shrinking population number, and the labour force that includes employed persons and jobseekers has been declining. 
In 2016, the unemployment rate accounted for 7.9%, down by 9.9% from 2010 (17.8%). Over the seven years, the menis unemployment rate fell by more than 12%, and the womenis unemployment rate decreased by more than a half, i.e. from 14.5% to 6.7%. The youth unemployment rate (population aged 15n24) amounted to 14.5% in 2016.  

The improvement of the employment and unemployment indicators was mostly influenced not only by the growing economy but also by the creation of quality jobs and the implementation of active labour market policy measures provided for in the Programme for Increasing Employment.  
With a view to modernising the legal framework of the labour market and this way enhancing the flexibility of employment relationships to adjust them to the present-day needs of economic development, a package of laws on \0xEBThe Legal-Administrative Model of Employment Relationships and State Social Insurancei was adopted in 2016, consisting of three main laws: the Labour Code, the Law on Employment and the Law on Unemployment Social Insurance. 
The minimum wage has been increased consistently, which has had an effect also on the growth of Lithuaniais average monthly gross wage.  
The Youth Guarantee initiative is being implemented to ensure that young people aged 15n29 who are not engaged in work or studies receive a good quality offer for employment, education or traineeship within four months. In 2016, 49 800 young people received employment, support for creating a job was provided to 2 200 youths, and 13 000 young unemployed people started an activity under a business license. 
To ensure a balanced labour market, the Lithuanian Labour Exchange implements vocational training of the unemployed. Unemployed persons who are most difficult to integrate into the labour market gain benefit from support of the European Union structural funds and projects designed for target groups. 
The Lithuanian Tourism Development Programme 2014n2020 (hereinafter \0xEBthe Programmei) lays down the objectives and tasks of the state for the development of tourism for creating competitive tourism products and services, developing tourism infrastructure and services, creating and promoting an environment favourable to the tourism industry and introducing effective marketing and communication measures to increase the competitiveness and visibility of tourism in the Republic of Lithuania and on international markets. The measures of the Programme promote the export of tourism services to foreign states in accordance with the principles of sustainable tourism and contribute to the increase of employment and the reduction of the unemployment rate among the population. In 2017, guidelines for the development of sustainable tourism of the Republic of Lithuania were drawn up as a guidance document. Based on these guidelines, 15 indicators of sustainable tourism have been prepared. 
With a view to achieving the targets laid down in the United Nations Agenda for Sustainable Development by promoting sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, and seeking to join the initiative of the United Nations World Tourism Organization and drawing the attention of the Lithuanian public, tourism policy makers and its implementers to the principles of sustainable development, in 2017 the first sustainable tourism tendering procedure was organised and the implementation of the project \0xEBFrom sustainable development goals to a prosperous Baltic Sea regioni scheduled to end in August 2018 was launched.  
Lithuania has applied financial measures to improve and promote sustainable and efficient use of resources and raw materials. The National Industry Digitalisation Platform \0xEBIndustry 4.0i will contribute to the more rapid growth of the Lithuanian economy and the more rapid increase of GVA created in the industry sector, ensure the increased competitiveness of Lithuanian industry on the international scale and promote the creation of new jobs. During the recent six years the Lithuanian labour market has shown an upward trend in employment and a downward trend in unemployment among all age groups of the population. The improvement of the employment and unemployment indicators was mostly influenced not only by the growing economy but also by the creation of quality jobs and the implementation of active labour market policy measures provided for in the Programme for Increasing Employment. 
 
 BUILD RESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE, PROMOTE INCLUSIVE  SUSTAINABLE INDUSTRIALIZATION AND FOSTER INNOVATION 
AND 
  Goal 9 
 
Lithuania is living through the Fourth Industrial Revolution which provides conditions to create and shape a life where virtual and material production systems interact flexibly. It is observed that the Fourth Industrial Revolution is most intensive in the manufacturing industry sector. According to the division of enterprises, small and medium-sized businesses account for 99.8% of all enterprises operating in Lithuania, of which 9.2% are manufacturing businesses. 
In the manufacturing industry sector, the increase of the gross value added in this sector, compared to gross domestic product, was observed from 2010 to 2012 (up to 20.7%). Since 2013, however the created GVA has been declining steadily. In 2010-2016, GVA per capita created in the manufacturing industry grew from EUR 1 500 to EUR 2 300.

The increase of GVA per capita in the manufacturing industry sector has been observed due to the higher demand for and exports of its products. Between 2013 and 2016, the number of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) decreased from 10 000 to 8 700. This means that exports from large enterprises have enlarged, as the value of exports has been increasing. To create conditions facilitating the integration of SMEs into international markets, a \0xEBsingle windowi system has been introduced where information on export opportunities is provided in the digital environment, workshops on practical issues are organised for first-time exporters, checks on SME preparedness for export and operation on export markets are carried out, SMEs are informed about separate markets, and an educational programme intended to help enterprises create their own trademarks is implemented. 
Taking into account the existing distribution of enterprises by size in Lithuania and value added created in the industry sector, which in particular reflects the financial capability to implement investment, research and technology development projects, small and medium-sized enterprise and their development are promoted.  
During the Fourth Industrial Revolution based on the results of digital revolution, new technologies and innovation are promoted. With a view to developing research, modernising the technological capacity of the industry sector and promoting innovative solutions, in 2016 the funds allocated for this purpose accounted for 0.74% of GDP. The financial measures applied are designed to encourage enterprises to invest in innovation (\0xEBIntellect LT. Joint science-business projectsi), attract foreign investment to Lithuania (\0xEBSmartinvest LT+i, \0xEBSmart FDIi), enhance cooperation of private legal entities in scientific and experimental research (\0xEBInoklaster LTi) and cooperation between science and business (\0xEBInnovation chequesi), and promote products in great demand on the market (\0xEBInopatentas LTi). The funds earmarked for scientific research, experimental development and innovation in 2014n2020 constitute EUR 403.2 million. 
In 2016, a Business Consultant Network was established for the purpose of providing the required information, consulting, methodological and other support to small and medium-sized enterprises operating for not longer than five years concerning the issues of business start-up, funding sources, installation of new technologies and other issues of business organisation. It represents one of the measures that help small and medium-sized enterprises operating in the manufacturing industry to get familiar with up-to-date technologies, encourage such enterprises to install these technologies and this way increase labour productivity.  
In October 2013, Lithuania approved the priorities for Research and Experimental Development and Innovation, expecting a breakthrough in 2022. The priorities cover the spheres of energy, agro-innovation, biotechnology, transport, information and communication technology, new production processes and creative society. The priorities only include areas with the highest probability of a breakthrough achieved through the joint effort of business and science. A review of the Smart Specialisation is being conducted at present which will establish the relevance of technologies identified and unidentified in the Smart Specialisation Programme areas, the importance of existing and potential priorities, identify new potential Smart Specialisation priorities, provide recommendations for the monitoring and assessment of the strategy for Smart Specialisation, assign codes to the technologies referred to in the Smart Specialisation areas in accordance with the Classification of Economic Activities, and make additional recommendations.  
With a view to disclosing the business potential to receive economic benefit from the development and introduction of green innovation, it is important to look for and promote new solutions. In 2017, the Green Industry Innovation Programme, one of the first measures in Lithuania focused directly on the promotion of green innovation in business, was implemented. The funds of the Green Industry Innovation Programme were used to finance and implement 13 projects related to innovative environmental technologies and green products (support of EUR 7 million was distributed to the projects). 
In 2016, Lithuania ratified the Paris Agreement. In implementing innovation in production processes, it is sought to ensure environmental aspects and energy efficiency in industrial entities. Estimating CO2 emissions in the energy sector, emissions per unit of value added were noticeably declining and in 2015 they amounted to 0.31 kilotonnes/EUR mln. of GDP. With a view to building resilient infrastructure and monitoring industrialisation already under way, Lithuania encourages economic entities to introduce innovation that would contribute to the synergy of environmental, economic and social criteria and help to achieve the set goals. 
During the Fourth Industrial Revolution in Lithuania, the sector most intensely affected by this revolution is the manufacturing industry where the observed increase of GVA per capita is driven by the higher demand for manufactured products and their exports. Taking into account the existing distribution of enterprises by size in Lithuania and value added created in the industry sector, which in particular reflects the financial capability to implement investment, research and technology development projects, small and medium-sized enterprise and its development are promoted. Moreover, a Business Consultant Network is operating which helps manufacturing SMEs to get familiar with up-to-date technologies and encourage such enterprises to install these technologies. Lithuania has approved the priorities for Research and Experimental Development and Innovation that will encourage industrial enterprises to introduce innovation and help business entities and science representatives to cooperate in a more productive way. The priorities only cover areas with the highest probability of a breakthrough achieved through the joint effort of business and science. Therefore, a breakthrough is expected already in 2022. 
 
REDUCE INEQUALITY WITHIN AND AMONG COUNTRIES 
 
  Goal 10 
 
Through its legal framework Lithuania is making efforts to ensure equal opportunities and required support to each resident of the country. The greatest challenge for Lithuania is income inequality which often determines the inadequate safeguarding of other rights as well. 
In view of the growing economy and increasing earned income, income inequality shows an upward trend. Considering the decreasing unemployment and the rising level of job vacancies, wages in recent years have been growing by about 5% annually. Income inequality that is closely related to financial poverty has increased significantly in Lithuania: in 2016 the income of 20% of the wealthiest population was 7.1 times higher than that of 20% of the poorest population. This indicator is one of the highest in the European Union.  
Income inequality is also significant between rural and urban areas. The average income of rural households only accounts for about one-third of income in urban households. Income inequality causes social tensions, projects social crises and boosts emigration. Social policy, educational and health care measures are not sufficient for reducing this inequality, and Lithuaniais business and economic sector must get more involved in the process.  
In all of its key strategic documents Lithuania has set an objective of reducing poverty and income inequality. To achieve this objective, it is important to increase income, retirement pensions and social benefits, reduce the tax burden for those earning the lowest income and enhance the social responsibility of people with the highest income.  
In a recovering economy, Lithuaniais minimum wage has been increased consistently, seeking to bring it close to 50% of the average wage. In 2013n2016 the minimum monthly wage (MMW) was raised six times. In 2016, MMW increased by 54.3% from 2012. In addition, with a view to promoting wage growth, the new Labour Code adopted in 2017 stipulates that the minimum wage is the minimum allowable wage for lowskilled work. Low-skilled work is work that is not subject to any requirements of special qualification skills or professional abilities. This step is aimed at making the labour market more skilled and demanding comprehensive knowledge and abilities. 
The average wage paid in enterprises or organisations with more than three employees has been announced publicly since 2017. The purpose of this move is to make payment of wages more transparent.  
Social security pensions were increased in 2017. This has affected more than 593 000 pensioners, more than 202 000 recipients of disability pensions and 7 400 recipients of early pensions. With a view to ensuring the consistent increase of pensions in accordance with the countryis economic indicators, pensions are subject to indexing from 1 January 2018. 
State-supported income (SSI) has been increased from 2018, which is particularly relevant for persons exposed to poverty who receive financial social support under the Lithuanian Law on Cash Social Assistance for Low-Income Families (Single Residents).  
The increased SSI has enlarged the number of people eligible for social assistance and the funds allocated for social assistance, as the amount of SSI determines the social benefit, the compensation for apartment heating costs, the one-time resettlement benefit for asylum beneficiaries, the monthly financial benefit for the immediate needs of asylum beneficiaries, the benefit for food and petty expenses of foreign nationals residing in the Refuge Reception Centre, the right to studentsi free meals and support for the purchase of school supplies, the right to support for the purchase or rent of housing, and the right to support for the repatriation of remains. 
In 2016n2018, Lithuania has increased the basic non-taxable income amount (hereinafter \0xEBNTIAi) and individual non-taxable income amounts for the disabled.  
In 2016n2017, an additional non-taxable income amount for children was increased. Since 1 January 2018 Lithuania has eliminated the additional non-taxable income amount and shifted towards direct child benefits (each child receives child money as a universal benefit). This decision was taken for the purpose of helping all persons raising children, as under the previous system persons with the lowest income had no real possibility to benefit from the additional NTIA for children. In addition, parents with low income or large families are paid additional benefits.  
The steady increase of NTIA has considerably reduced the tax burden on low-income individuals, as a larger part of income has become tax-exempt. While in 2015 NTIA applied to the minimum monthly wage accounted for 51% of wages, in 2018 NTIA applied to the minimum monthly wage of EUR 400 already amounts to 95% and the taxable part only equals 5%. 
Figure 10 
TEI applicable to minimum wage and taxable part in 2015 and 2018, EUR 
 
In recent years, changes in the Lithuanian tax system have been focused not only on the increased progressivity of personal income tax by reducing the burden on low-income individuals, but also on the general increased progressivity of the tax system so as to ensure more efficient redistribution. 
Since 2012 an immovable property tax has been imposed on non-commercial property of high value owned by individuals. Since 2018 progressive taxation for non-commercial immovable property owned by natural persons has been established and reliefs applicable to capital revenue have been limited. 
To reduce the shadow economy and provide larger guarantees to workers, a MMW \0xEBfloori has been established for the employeris social security contributions.  
The tax measures applied in a combination with social policy measures in Lithuania had influenced the situation in which the growth rate of the income of individuals lower than 40% of average equalised disposable income in 2012n2016 was by 13% higher, compared to the overall growth rate of equalised disposable income. 
Figure 11 
Growth rate of average equalised disposable income lower than 40% and of average equalised disposable income in 2012n2016 
 
Having become a donor country officially in 2004, Lithuania carries out continuous and effective development cooperation activities aimed at contributing to the sustainable development of the world and reducing inequality among countries. Lithuania provides bilateral assistance that promotes social and economic reforms in partner countries, the geography of which has expanded to 24 states in 2017. Lithuania also contributes to the multilateral efforts to reduce inequality among countries by payment of compulsory and voluntary contributions to international organisations and funds engaged in development cooperation activities (for more information on Lithuaniais development cooperation assistance see sustainable development Goal 17). 
 
 MAKE CITIES AND HUMAN SETTLEMENTS INCLUSIVE, SAFE, RESILIENT  AND SUSTAINABLE  
  Goal 11 
 
The urban system of Lithuania consists of the capital city as the centre of the state, five regional centres (big cities) and local level centres (small and medium-sized towns). Two-thirds of the Lithuanian population (about 1.9 million) live in cities.  
The larger share of GDP is created in cities. These represent centres of economic, social, spiritual, cultural and scientific progress where the greatest problems related to human life and activity are concentrated.  
The principles of sustainable development are being gradually transferred to the urban development in Lithuania. The distribution of the population is uneven in Lithuania: about 20% of the population live in the capital city, 10% reside in the countryis second largest city, two cities are each inhabited by more than 5%, and between 30 000 and 60 000 people reside in each of several other cities. The population is increasing in the capital and the regions of several big cities, while in other regions it is decreasing due to emigration and the negative natural population change (in 2010n2016 it decreased by almost 9%). The average population density in the built-up territories of Lithuaniais big cities amounts to 39 people per hectare. This indicator not only defines the sustainability of the cities themselves and the viability of their functions and activities, but it also has a significant effect on regional development. The value of this indicator is higher than the minimum recommended value for a big city (30 residents/ha) required for the payback of the technical and social infrastructure being created. The population density in the built-up territories of Lithuaniais big cities is shrinking, which leads to the growing costs of infrastructure operation. The majority of the Lithuanian population (about 66%) live in multi-apartment houses (high density dwellings) built between 1961 and 1990. The homes that have not undergone proper maintenance are greatly worn out. 
The most relevant urban policy challenges of Lithuania at present include the inadequate consistency and efficiency of social, economic, territorial and public infrastructure development, the implementation of integrated measures that improve energy efficiency (through renovation not only of separate building but also of residential quarters) and the reduction of flood and other risks to cities as a result of climate change.  
Lithuania acknowledges that this situation makes its development more complicated. Therefore, relying on the legal framework, the state seeks to ensure the quality of the environment suitable for the sustainable existence of all forms of life, as well as the sustainable development of territories and infrastructure.  
In 2017, Lithuania prepared the Regional Policy Guidelines 2017n2027 (White Paper) aimed at outlining a long-term regional policy perspective which would continue for at least a few political cycles and comply with the European Union multiannual financial framework. These guidelines are expected to acquire a legal basis via the comprehensive plan of the territory of the Republic of Lithuania.  
The comprehensive plan of the territory of the Republic of Lithuania, the preparation of which began in 2017, will be an effective fundamental document for spatial planning of the territory of Lithuania, integrating the countryis sectoral policy provisions, and will be in effect from 2020 to 2030 and with a vision until 2050. The plan will be a tool for implementing the territorial aspects of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals in Lithuania. 
To achieve an integrated and systematic regulation of public relationships in the sphere of architecture, preserve the existing and create the future environment of appropriate quality that is in harmony with the originality and culture of the country, as well as reflect public interests and represent a lasting legacy underlined in the Law on Architecture,  establishing a uniform system for the formation and implementation of architectural policy, passed in 2017 The Law lays down architectural development areas and defines the competence of national, municipal and other authorities in the sphere of architecture, the status and functions of a municipalityis chief architect, measures for ensuring the quality of architecture, etc.  
With a view to optimising the urban system of Lithuania, an Urban Charter is being drawn up. The Charter will guide urban development with a long-term perspective and provide the objectives and priorities of the strategy for the provision of housing. The provisions of the Charter will be included in the comprehensive plan of the territory of the Republic of Lithuania. An internet website www.urbanistinechartija.com has been opened for more efficient communication with stakeholders and dissemination of information. This ensures the feedback and dialogue with the public at large. 
To solve infrastructure development problems in an integrated way countrywide, prevent the chaotic urban sprawl, especially the development of pre-urban areas, create favourable conditions for investment and establish a uniform system for the regulation of infrastructure development in residential areas, a Law on Municipal Infrastructure Development is being drafted.  
For the purpose of involving the public in decision-making, managing resources more rationally and promoting the implementation of sustainable development principles in the land-use planning and construction processes, Lithuania seeks to create a centralised \0xEBTopography, engineering infrastructure, land-use planning and construction portali through which electronic services that combine land-use planning, monitoring and construction processes would be provided. This would enable land-use planners, architects and builders to carry out the required processes with ease and speed, and the population to monitor changes in their environment related to land-use planning and construction. The construction sector is undergoing digitalisation which includes the creation and introduction of a system of measures designed for the application of the Building Information Modelling (BIM) method. This will enhance the efficient use of resources assigned to the planning, design, construction, operation and management of public sector buildings.  
Conditions are improved constantly for public participation in the public management processes of cultural heritage protection, newsletter are issued, and internet websites publish information for managers of cultural heritage sites on various funding opportunities for the management of cultural heritage sites. The public have an opportunity to access electronic services of cultural heritage (KPEPIS Information System). 
Lithuania has prepared guidelines for the planning of green infrastructure and its application in practice and a programme for the implementation of solutions under the National Landscape Management Plan. Much attention is devoted to public participation in the formation of landscape. 
The Lithuanian state budget and European Union funds are used to finance initiatives for the management or restoration of valuable and picturesque urban landscape complexes. Municipalities have an opportunity to manage or restore complexes of natural or urban landscape or their separate elements, draw up municipal landscape management plans, manage reference landscapes and establish green infrastructure in cities. Modernisation of 4 000 multi-apartment buildings until 2020 is sought. In 2005n2017, Lithuania modernised 2 757 multi-apartment buildings, and another 1 500 such buildings are to be renovated between 2018 and 2020. A Risk Sharing Fund has been established in cooperation with the European Investment Bank. Using a combination of financial engineering instruments and guarantee mechanisms, the Fund is expected to attract about EUR 500 million from private investors for funding loans granted to projects.  
At the European Union level, Lithuania along with institutions, organisations and cities of other member states participates in the EU urban Partnership of Sustainable Use of Land and Nature-Based Solutions. The purpose of this Partnership is to ensure that urban processes improve the environment and the quality of life. The Urban Agenda for the EU and the New Urban Agenda have the same vision and are very important for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. 
In 2015, Lithuania approved the national Guidelines for Sustainable Urban Mobility Planning (hereinafter \0xEBthe Guidelinesi) which recommend that cities with the population of more than 25 000 or the status of a resort prepare and implement Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (hereinafter \0xEBSUMPsi). Eighteen municipalities of Lithuania have met this condition. 
SUMP measures are designed to develop and integrate different modes of transport, by giving priority to public passenger and non-motorised or low-emission transport. They meet the requirements for compatibility of sustainable development, economic viability, social equality and health and environmental quality needs. The plans provide for the sustainable use of urban space by adapting the existing transport infrastructure to public passenger transport, pedestrians and cyclists, the increase of attractiveness of the urban environment, the enhancement of the quality of life and public health, the achievement of traffic safety, and the reduction of air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption. 
At the end of 2017 nine municipal administrations of Lithuania had their SUMPs prepared, and the remaining nine municipalities will have their SUMPs ready in 2018. Municipalities implement mobility measures provided for in the plans. Also, Guidelines for the development of public electrical vehicle charging infrastructure have been drawn up at the initiative of the Ministry of Transport and Communications for the purpose of promoting the use of electrical vehicles through the development of electrical vehicle charging infrastructure. In 2015, a plan for electrical vehicles and the development of their infrastructure and charging stations on roads of national significance was approved.  
Until now there have been only two charging points of large capacity on Lithuaniais roads of national significance. At the end of 2017, however, 10 electrical vehicle fast charging points were opened on the road of national significance A1. By 2018, charging points on major roads are to be built every 50 kilometres. Their total number on roads of national significance is expected to come up to 26. At least 100 public electrical vehicle charging points should be installed by the end of 2020 in Lithuanian cities and preurban areas with the population exceeding 25 000.  
The aim of developing the network of public electrical vehicle charging points is to ensure that this infrastructure development contributes to the achievement of the target that electrical vehicles account for 5% of all vehicles registered in Lithuania per year by 2020, and for 10% by 2025. 
Lithuania is continuing the integrated development of green public transport, with 57 new green public transport vehicles to be acquired in 2018, and is reconstructing pedestrian and bike paths. 
In implementing the above-mentioned measures, opportunities are enhanced for all citizens of the country to use safe, accessible and sustainable public transport systems.  
To implement the above measures, Lithuania seeks to develop sustainable spatial planning through the consistent integration of urban, social, economic and natural infrastructure, as well as the rational use of resources and the increase of urban resilience to various human-induced and natural risks. The new comprehensive plan of the territory of the Republic of Lithuania that is currently being prepared and that is to integrate the UN Sustainable Development Goals will be one of the main instruments for ensuring inclusive and sustained urbanisation, reducing social economic exclusion among cities and regions and the negative effect of built-up areas on the environment, and ensuring the protection of natural and cultural heritage. The implementation of the above sustainable mobility measures will enhance the opportunities for all citizens of the country to use safe, accessible and sustainable public transport systems within and outside cities. 
 
ENSURE SUSTAINABLE CONSUMPTION AND PRODUCTION PATTERNS 
 
  Goal 12 
 
One of the very important environmental policy areas of Lithuania is the sustainable use of natural resources and waste management. Lithuania has explored 17 types of minerals, of which nine types (limestone, dolomite, sand, gravel, clay, chalk marlstone, peat, sapropel and oil) are mined. The quality of water in 52% of all water bodies is good. In 2015, 9.8% of the drinking groundwater resources were extracted. The forest cover is increasing in Lithuania every year. At the beginning of 2016, the forest land area amounted to 2 186 700 hectares and occupied 33.5% of the territory of the country. Since 2011 this area has enlarged by 16 000 ha, and the forest cover has grown by 0.3%. Municipal waste generation per capita increased from 404 kg to 444 kg in 2010n2016, but municipal waste recycling went up from 5% in 2010 to 48% in 2016, and municipal waste disposal in landfills decreased from 86% in 2010 to 30% in 2016. 
 
 

 
The volume of hazardous waste per 1 000 of the population climbed from 35 tonnes in 2010 to 58 tonnes in 2016, and the disposal of this waste between 2010 and 2016 increased accordingly from 7% to 12%, and its incineration during this period went up from 2.2% to 5.3%. The quantity of recovered hazardous waste declined from 64% to 43% in 2010n2014. In recent years, however, the volume of recovered hazardous waste, including processed hazardous waste, has increased and reached 52% in 2016. 
The National Environmental Protection Strategy defines the priority areas of the environmental protection policy, long-term objectives up to 2030 and a vision for the Lithuanian environment up to 2050. One of the economic measures provided for in the Strategy is the change of the behaviour and decision-making of economic entities related to environmental protection, environmental pollution reduction and resource efficiency through green public procurement.  
A new version of the Law on Public Procurement came into force in mid-2017. This Law substantially reforms the regulation of public procurement, with a particular focus on the promotion of innovation and the solution of environmental, social and economic issues. In assessing proposals, priority is given to the most economically advantageous tender in terms of the price-quality ratio or the costs during the term when goods, services or works will be provided. Such procurement should account for at least 30% of the total value of procurement annually. When assessing tenders according to the criterion of the price-quality ratio, account can be taken of various qualitative, environmental, innovative and social aspects. 
The above Law on Public Procurement requires to apply the compulsory energy efficiency and environmental protection requirements with respect to goods, services or works to product categories such paper, office equipment, information technology equipment, public transport vehicles, home appliances and equipment, cleaning products and services, construction works, building materials, plumbing fixtures, etc.  
The new public procurement regulation which came into force in 2017 is aimed not only at ensuring the transparency and effectiveness of public procurement, but also at promoting procurement oriented towards other policy areas. The public sector as a large customer can contribute to the social and environmental objectives of promoting innovation and small and medium-sized enterprise. The goals set for public procurement demand greater public procurement professionalism, and Lithuania presently is devoting much attention to enhancing this aspect. In view of other countriesi practices and in cooperation with experts of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, in 2018 Lithuania plans to draw up an action plan for enhancing public procurement professionalism which could include measures such as a certification system of contracting authorities, targeted training, increased centralisation of public procurement, etc. 
The transition towards a stronger circular economy through improved resource efficiency, recycling of waste and reuse of materials is a challenge that is already being addressed using specific measures provided for in the Government Programme. These measures will increase the placing on the market of recyclable products and packaging, promote wider reuse of products and their preparation for recycling, help to implement the goals of waste preparation for reuse and recycling and encourage the change of consumption habits. It is planned to review taxes on environmental pollution with waste by establishing rates that support waste reduction and recycling, implementing separate food waste collection, approving the quality criteria for compost and the end-of-waste criteria, and introducing other measures.  
To contribute to the circular economy goals and encourage enterprises to use raw materials in an efficient way and optimise production processes as well as reduce waste volumes generated and air pollution, measures have been prepared for the allocation of financing from the European Union structural funds. One of such measures is \0xEBEco-Innovation LTi that will help to promote investment in cleaner production innovation through the application of methods for the rational use of resources and pollution prevention, e.g., modernisation of processes by reducing the adverse impact on the environment, the more rational use of natural resources and the shift towards low-waste production in enterprises, and the increase of waste reuse and recycling in enterprises. The measure \0xEBEco-Innovation LT+i is intended to promote investment in tangible assets (equipment and technology) which reduce the adverse impact of economic activities on the environment. It is planned to manufacture new products using waste from manufacturing processes as the main raw material. A Uniform Accounting Information System of Products, Packaging and Waste has been launched in 2018 which will help to ensure effective monitoring and control of the accounting of waste generation and management in enterprises and the planning of follow-up actions for the development of the waste management system.  
Lithuania is reducing the consumption of plastic bags. Carrier bags are not for free in most retail places. To implement the Law on the Management of Packaging and Packaging Waste, lightweight plastic carrier bags (except very lightweight plastic carrier bags with a wall thickness below 15 microns) will no longer be available for free at retail places of goods or products after 2018. Funds are provided for the creation of video and audio advertisements for public information about the reduction of the consumption of plastic carrier bags and their proper management. In cooperation with the Association of Lithuanian Trade Companies and retail chains, advertising clips are broadcast on displays at Lithuaniais big retailers, and the reduced consumption of plastic bags and their adverse impact on the environment are discussed in television and radio shows which call on the population to demonstrate awareness and minimise the consumption of carrier bags. The consumption of plastic bags at retail outlets has been declining since 2014, i.e. during three years the quantity of very lightweight plastic carrier bags has decreased from 260 to 224 per capita, and of thicker plastic bags from 39 to 36 per capita.

Although the decrease of the number of carrier bags per capita has been relatively small, this change is especially important countrywide, as the unused bags have not become waste and have not end up in the environment  
With a view to promoting sustainable consumption, in 2016 Lithuania introduced a deposit system for disposable beverage packaging. Producers and importers that supply alcoholic and alcohol-free beverages in disposable glass, plastic or metal containers with a capacity of more than 100 ml, but below 3 l, are obligated to participate in the deposit system for disposable beverage packaging. Individuals who buy beverages in metal, glass and plastic containers marked with the deposit symbol pay the deposit at the point of sale and can collect a refund after delivering the packaging to a reverse vending machine. The performance of this system, i.e. the container return rate, reached about 70% in the first year of operation and more than 90% in the second year of operation. 
In promoting sustainable consumption and production patterns, Lithuania is changing the behaviour of consumers and economic entities related to environmental protection, reduction of environmental pollution and resource efficiency by involving them in decision-making processes. Green public procurement is carried out, and requirements for energy efficiency and environmental protection of goods, services or works are applied. Enterprises are encouraged to implement the principles of a circular economy, including the efficient use of resources and raw materials, optimisation of production processes by reducing waste generation and air pollution, and the promotion of waste recycling. It is planned to review taxes on environmental pollution with waste by establishing rates that support waste reduction and recycling, implementing food waste collection, establishing the quality criteria for compost and introducing other measures. Consumers in Lithuania are informed about the adverse impact of plastics on the environment and their proper management, as well as alternatives for plastic bags. The consumption of plastic bags has decreased, and from 2019 plastic carrier bags will no longer be available for free at retail places of goods and products. 
 
 TAKE URGENT ACTION TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE AND ITS  IMPACTS 
  Goal 13 
 
The Lithuanian policy on climate change is formed on the basis of international agreements (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change or UNFCCC, Paris Agreement, etc.), EU strategic documents and legislation on goals and targets.  
In the second commitment period 2013n2020 established by the Doha amendment to the Kyoto Protocol, the European Union and its member states, including Lithuania, have assumed a joint commitment to reduce greenhouse gas (hereinafter \0xEBGHGi) emissions by 20%, compared to 1990 level. Under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change approved in 2015, the EU and its member states have committed themselves to reduce GHG emissions by at least 40% by 2030 and promote the development of a lowcarbon economy resilient to climate change impacts, seeking together with other countries to reduce GHG emissions by 80n90% by 2050 and achieve climate neutrality in the second half of this century.  
With a view to implementing the GHG emission reduction targets set for Lithuania in international and EU legal acts, the National Strategy for Climate Change Management Policy was adopted in 2012. The Strategy lays down legally binding short-term and indicative medium- and long-term targets and objectives for climate change mitigation and adaptation by 2050. It is planned to achieve by 2020 that GHG emissions of the EU emission trading system (ETS) sectors (combustion plants with the capacity of more than 20 MW and the chemical industry) do not exceed 8.530 million tonnes of CO2 eq.; to achieve that the non-ETS sectors (transport, agriculture, waste management, industrial enterprises with the installed capacity below 20 MW, public sector buildings, households, fisheries, construction, services, etc.) meet their annual GHG emission targets and do not exceed 15.24 million tonnes of CO2 eq.; to achieve that the share of renewable energy sources, by comparison with the gross final energy consumption of the country, accounts for at least 23%; to reduce energy consumption by 1.5% every year (reduce energy consumption by 17% in 2020 as compared to 2009), and to assign at least 0.38% of GDP for the implementation of short-term climate change mitigation targets.  
Lithuania will contribute to the achievement of the EU targets for GHG emission reduction. The mediumterm target is to reduce GHG emissions by 40% by 2030 compared to 1990 level. The long-term target is to reduce GHG emission by 80% by 2050 compared to 1990 level. 
To implement the Strategy, in 2013 the Interinstitutional Action Plan on the implementation of targets and objectives for 2013n2020 of the National Strategy for Climate Change Management Policy was approved and is updated annually. The plan defines measures for the reduction of GHG emissions and adaptation to climate change in all sectors of the Lithuanian economy (industry, energy, agriculture, transport, waste management, etc.). The measures of the plan are also implemented and the funds for their implementation are allocated by other ministries, municipalities, state research institutes and universities, enterprises, institutions, organisations and other persons within their respective competence. While drawing up development programmes, interinstitutional action plans, operational plans or other planning documents for their management areas (energy, industry, development of residential areas, agriculture, transport, health care, etc.), the ministries mainstream the targets and objectives for climate change mitigation and adaptation set out in the Strategy, provide for measures to implement them and ensure close interinstitutional cooperation. 
The Lithuanian economy is in line with the principles of sustainable economy development and has reached decoupling emissions from economy growth: in 2016 the GHG emissions decreased by 58% compared to 1990 level, and GDP grew by 38%. The share of renewable energy sources in the countryis gross final energy consumption balance exceeded one-fifth in 2016 and amounted to 25.46%, and savings equalled 839 kT CO2 eq. 
To implement the commitments under the Paris Agreement, in the period 2021n2030 Lithuania together with other EU member states will seek to achieve the EU climate change and energy policy objectives by 2030. Lithuanian operators that participate in the EU emission trading system (ETS) will reduce GHG emissions together with operators of other EU member states by 43%, and the non-ETS sectors will pursue the GHG emission reduction target of 9%, to compare with 2005 level. To achieve the climate and energy objectives by 2030, Lithuania has prepared the draft National Energy Independence Strategy which provides: 
o to increase the share of renewable energy sources (RES) in the gross final consumption of energy 
   (up to 30% by 2020, 45% by 2030 and 80% by 2050); o to improve energy efficiency (in 2030 the intensity of primary and final energy will be 1.5 times lower than in 2017, and 2.4 times lower in 2050); 
o to achieve that by 2030 RES account for 15% of energy in the transport sector, reduce the use of vehicles running on conventional fuels (petrol and diesel) in cities by 50%, achieve that by 2050 RES in the transport sector amount to 50% and reduce the use of vehicles running on fossil fuels in cities by 100%. 
In 2017, Lithuania began preparing a draft integrated national energy and climate plan which provides for policies and measures of Lithuaniais different economic sectors for the development of a low-carbon economy, such as the improvement of energy efficiency, the use of renewable energy sources, the enhancement of the EU emissions trading system by preserving the competitiveness of energy-intensive industries, and the implementation of eco-innovation technologies through the enhancement of research and experimental development.  
Lithuania contributes to financial assistance for developing countries in the sphere of climate change mitigation and adaptation to climate change by allocating funds from the Climate Change Special Programme. Since 2014 Lithuania has supported bilateral development cooperation projects for the purpose of mobilising the private sector contribution with public sector funds. 
 
 CONSERVE AND SUSTAINABLY USE THE OCEANS, SEAS AND MARINE  RESOURCES FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT  
 Goal 14 
 
Clean water is an especially important element of wildlife. Water affects all spheres of human life, and due to the intensive water cycle in the environment even those activities that are distant from water bodies affect them.  
As a result of its specific hydrographical and climatic conditions, the Baltic Sea is one of the largest brackish water bodies on the planet. The particularly sensitive and interrelated marine ecosystems have produced a medium for the unique fauna and flora of the Baltic Sea. This has also determined the exceptional sensitivity and vulnerability of the Baltic Sea. The hydrodynamic features of the sea and human activity have led to eutrophication, pollution with dangerous substances and litter and problems of biodiversity loss that the Baltic Sea is facing today. In the Baltic Sea area that belongs to Lithuania, the human economic activities are quite intensive. Situated in this area are the Klaip?da State Seaport and the B?ting? oil terminal. Also, the subsoil excavated in the port is sunk in the sea, and intensive commercial fishing is conducted. However, the Lithuanian marine waters boast unique natural assets as well.  
The Marine Strategy Framework Directive provides 11 qualitative descriptors used to determine good environmental status of marine waters. The Baltic Sea environmental status is good only according to one qualitative descriptor n sea-floor integrity. The environmental status is not good according to the qualitative descriptors of biodiversity, non-indigenous species, commercially exploited fish, food webs, eutrophication, concentrations of contaminants in the sea and seafood for human consumption. The status according to the descriptors of hydrographical conditions, marine litter and underwater noise has not been determined due to the lack of research and reliable information. 
To achieve a systematic and integrated approach to water protection problems and improved efficiency of available resources, in 2017 Lithuania approved the Water Field Development Programme 2017n2023. The Programme lays down the objectives and targets for the protection of the Baltic Sea environment, the management of the Nemunas, Venta, Lielup? and Daugava River Basin Districts, the reduction of water pollution from agricultural sources and the spheres of drinking water supply and wastewater management. The Programme contributes to the implementation of the national, EU and international laws that establish an obligation to improve the integrated management of water bodies (marine and inland waters) through the use of the sustainable development principles, and to conduct water management according not to administrative but natural river basin boundaries and implement ecosystem-based management methods of human activities. 
With a view to ensuring good environmental status of the groundwater and surface water bodies and the Baltic Sea, reducing flood risk and providing conditions for the whole population of the country to have access to drinking water that meets the safety and quality standards, the Programme sets forth five water sector development objectives: improve the status of surface water and groundwater bodies, achieve and maintain good environmental status of the Baltic Sea, reduce flood risk and their effects throughout the territory of the country, provide the population with quality public services of drinking water supply and wastewater management and reduce environmental pollution with wastewater, and implement the requirements of water protection and use more effectively.  
When carrying out economic activities in the sea, account should be taken of its features, natural processes, protected habitats and sensitive species, and human-induced biodiversity loss should be prevented. The planned actions represent an obligation to improve the integrated management of the marine environment by using an ecosystem-based method for the management of human activities and providing conditions for the sustainable use of marine assets and provided services.  
In order to solve the problem of eutrophication, the Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission (HELCOM) has set nitrogen and phosphorus reduction targets for each Baltic Sea country. Lithuania has assumed a commitment from 2013 to reduce the input of nitrogen and phosphorus to the Baltic Sea by 19% and 56% respectively, compared to 1997n2003 levels. To achieve good environmental status, Lithuania will ensure that populations of commercially exploited fish are within safe biological limits and preserve the structure of the Baltic Sea food web. Measures designed to maintain balanced populations of species must be applied not only in the Lithuanian sea area but also in sea territories occupied by a respective stock group.  
It is important for Lithuania to reduce the entry of dangerous chemical substances to the marine environment (according to HELCOM information of 2004n2012, 7% of ship accidents recorded in the Baltic Sea ended in some kind of marine pollution), preserve favourable conditions for wintering seabirds in their wintering sites, reduce their mortality rate due oiling with petroleum products and by-catch in commercial fishing gear, and minimise the risk of the presence of new non-indigenous species in the Baltic Sea (most of the non-indigenous species have arrived in the Lithuanian region of the Baltic Sea with sea currents or vessels, e.g. with shipsi ballast water).  
In improving the Baltic Sea environmental status, it is sought to ensure that economic activities in the sea have no great adverse impact on seabed habitats and that their loss and deterioration are avoided. In the Lithuanian water area, this is especially relevant for the use of bottom trawls, the dumping sites for dredged materials from the Klaip?da State Seaport, the sites of excavating sand to restore the beaches in Palanga, i.e. everywhere where physical changes of the seabed can directly affect seabed habitats.  
Lithuania is enhancing the prevention of floods, reducing the area of inhabited flood territories, implementing the management based on river basins, strengthening the state control on environmental protection in the water sector, and developing and renovating the drinking water supply and wastewater collection infrastructure to ensure that individually managed wastewater causes no environmental pollution. It is also improving the performance of drinking water supply and wastewater management enterprises and enhancing the quality of services provided. 
The aspect of cooperation is especially important for the environmental protection of the Baltic Sea as an especially unique water body that faces the above-mentioned problems and problems reflected in national legislation due to its isolation and slow water change. Since Lithuania is a Baltic region country and an EU member state, an integrated and sustainable approach to environmental protection, social aspects and the rapid economic development is important. Implementing EU and other international commitments, Lithuania gives priority to cooperation among institutions at the national and regional levels, e.g. using the structures of regional institutional cooperation and the international level. To ensure the protection and good environmental status of the Baltic Sea, the countries in the Baltic region coordinate their actions and the application of particular environmental measures. In addition, common solutions for reducing the Baltic Sea pollution are sought when addressing the main problems that the Baltic Sea has suffered from during the recent decades. 
 PROTECT, RESTORE AND PROMOTE SUSTAINABLE USE OF TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS, 
 SUSTAINABLY MANAGE FORESTS, COMBAT DESERTIFICATION, AND HALT AND REVERSE  LAND DEGRADATION AND HALT BIODIVERSITY LOSS 
  Goal 15 
 
The Lithuanian strategic documents provide for ensuring ecosystem stability, restoring ecosystems where possible, halting the deterioration of the quality of ecosystem services, conserving biodiversity and sustainably using natural resources. Lithuania complies with the requirements of national and European Union legislation, strategic documents and multilateral agreements in the sphere of nature protection.  
Natural and semi-natural ecosystems account for more than a third of the territory of Lithuania. The greatest wildlife diversity is concentrated in forests and wetlands. At present Lithuania boasts about 20 500 animal species, 1 800 plant species and 6 100 fungi species, of which 767 are protected species (501 protected species in 1992). Currently Lithuania has more than 4 000 objects entered on the lists of national plant genetic resources. To conserve landscape and biological diversity, the system of protected areas established in Lithuania covers 17.64% of the land area (5% in 1990), and their greater part belongs to the European ecological network Natura 2000 that includes territories important for the protection of birds and habitats. According to 2017 statistics, 18.3% of the Baltic Sea territory that belongs to Lithuania have been designated as protected areas and/or assigned to the European ecological network Natura 2000. 
Lithuania is only beginning to introduce a practice of biodiversity protection where efforts are made to protect valuable landscapes, habitats and other elements of biodiversity throughout the country rather than in protected areas alone, as well as to inventory, protect and restore destroyed or deteriorated ecosystem functions and services which are failing due to biodiversity loss. So far Lithuania has not conducted a proper assessment of the cumulative effect of human activities on ecosystems, the benefits provided by ecosystems and the future loss costs. The use of forests, the change of agricultural and forestry technologies, the disruption of the natural hydrological regime of forests and wetlands, the rapid construction, industry and infrastructure development, the build-up of shores of water bodies, environmental pollution and the irrational use of natural resources have led to the loss of natural habitats, their increased fragmentation and the spread of invasive alien species. The inadequate use of water resources for fish farming, shipping, water extraction and recreation and other purposes, as well as dams built on rivers in abundance in the past also have an adverse effect on water resources and aquatic ecosystems. Climate change adversely affects the conservation of biodiversity as well. The system of monitoring and assessment of biodiversity status has to be further developed for the effective assessment of biodiversity status and the planning of conservation actions in the preparation and coordination of economic activity plans. 
To address the above-described problems, an objective has been formulated in the national strategic documents to halt the loss of biodiversity and the deterioration of the quality of ecosystems and their services, and to restore them where possible. The measures for the implementation of this objective are the indicators provided in the table below. Only the indicators for protected terrestrial and marine areas have been achieved to date.

According to information of 2017, the indicators of the share of Lithuaniais terrestrial and marine territories designated as protected areas and assigned to the European ecological network Natura 2000 have already been achieved, and thy are 17.64% and 18.3% respectively. 
To ensure the appropriate and more integrated conservation and sustainable use of resources of terrestrial, inland water and marine ecosystems, plans have been put in place to assess the ecosystem status, their capacity to provide services and the quality of those services, and to take this assessment into consideration in the formation of a national policy. Lithuania has begun preparing for a project which by 2020 will map at least 24 most important ecosystem services, assess their status and conduct their socioeconomic assessment on a national scale, i.e. outlines of the existing practices for ecosystem service assessment in Lithuania and abroad will be drawn up, public information work on this issue will begin and a network of experts who would participate in the project activities will be established in the near future. The ecosystem service assessment will allow establishing the required legal instruments for the inventory of ecosystem services and the preservation of their balance, and priority measures for the restoration of ecosystems and their services. The data for 2013 have shown that the amount of local plant and animal species and habitat types of Community interest at a favourable conservation status found in Lithuania is decreasing. To achieve a favourable conservation status of protected fauna, flora and fungi species and habitat types, the legal framework on the conservation of protected species and the regulation of invasive species is constantly upgraded. Species action plans on the conservation of protected species and local plans for specific areas are drawn up, assessment of the status of protected species is carried out in accordance with the categories defined by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and the Protected Species Information System used in decision-making on the planning of economic activities is supplemented with extensive data. Reliable information on the areas and distribution of habitats in Lithuania has been collected, and national conservation objectives for the natural habitats of Community interest have been defined. Whereas most protected species are dependent on the nature and intensity of agricultural activities and various other conditions, the Lithuanian Rural Development Programme seeks to provide for diverse support measures intended to restore or appropriately maintain habitats of protected species. Actions for the regulation of the abundance of invasive species are carried out, and the public and institutions are informed about the damage caused by invasive species and are encouraged to eradicate or control them. 
To increase the effectiveness of biodiversity conservation an institution is being organised which would be responsible for the continuous implementation of the biodiversity conservation policy in entire territory of Lithuania. 
Lithuania is not yet exposed to desertification problems. However, the issues of soil and land degradation covered by the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification are important for Lithuania as well. Land is increasingly degraded due to climate change and other reasons, which becomes a factor threatening the quality of human life and affecting migration. In view of the growing population number worldwide and the need for the safe food supply, it is very important to notice any negative degradation processes in their early phase, take the necessary steps to halt them and prevent their transformation into desertification as the highest form of degradation. 
Lithuania takes an active part in addressing the problems of land degradation and desertification, and has undertaken to collect, analyse and share information related to desertification, and share experience and technological knowledge.  
All the main activities in Lithuanian forests are based on the principles of sustainable forest management. This is laid down in the Law on Forests which provides for regulating reforestation and forest protection and use and creating legal preconditions for the management of forests of all forms of ownership on the basis of the uniform principles of sustainable forest management ensuring rational use of forest resources while supplying raw materials to the industry, bringing the greatest social and economic benefit to the country by ensuring biodiversity conservation, increased forest productivity, landscape stability and environmental quality, as well as the possibility of performing ecological, economic and social functions at present and in the future without causing damage to other ecosystems. The major document shaping the forestry policy is the National Forestry Sector Development Programme 2012n2020 which lays down the strategic forestry sector objective, other forestry development objectives and tasks, their assessment criteria, the funding for implementation and the implementing institutions. Another very important document related to forest management in Lithuania is the National Environmental Strategy which provides for three environmental protection policy objectives for forests: conservation and increase of forests and forest resources, conservation and formation of sustainable forest ecosystems and assurance of rational exploitation of forest resources.  
The strategic forestry development goal in Lithuania is to increase multiple benefits provided by forests to society, taking into account the long duration of forest growth, different forms of ownership and their interaction, and also by ensuring the implementation of sustainable forest management in all forests of the country.  
With a view to conserving and increasing forests and their resources, forestland areas are constantly enlarged. The forestland area accounted for 33.2% of the territory of Lithuania in 2011, and 33.5% in 2016. The aim is to increase Lithuaniais forest cover to 34.2% by 2020 and to 35% by 2030. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 15 
 
With a view to ensuring the rational use of forest resources and increasing the productivity of stands in 
Lithuania, the volume of stands in forests is enlarged annually. This volume amounted to 490 mln. m3 in 2011 and 542.7 mln. m3 in 2017. The average volume of timber in all Lithuanian forests increased from 237 m3/ha in 2011 to 256 m3/ha in 2017. The current annual increment in timber volume in all stands went up from 16.6 mln. m3 in 2011 to 19.8 mln. m3 in 2017. About a half of the annual increment in timber volume in Lithuanian forests is used for timber production per year on average. This 50% logging and timber increment ratio is to be retained up to 2030. Thus, Lithuanian forests are used sustainably for timber production and the potential of the forests for logging is great, so even slightly increased volumes of production of timber from Lithuanian forests would cause no risk to forest ecosystems. 
In order to improve the economic efficiency and competitiveness of the forestry sector, mentioning the state forest management reform launched in 2017 is important. On 8 January 2018, the State Forest Enterprise, a single state forest management company, began its operations after merging of 42 selfstanding state forest enterprises. The concentration of state forest management in one state forest management enterprise creates preconditions for optimising the activities of the enterprise, standardising its processes, developing nature management measures in forests and devoting more attention to forestry activities. 
To conserve and increase the sustainability of forest ecosystems with account of their ecological and social roles and the impacts of climate change, a network of forest recreational infrastructure has been established which includes more than 2 000 various recreational sites in forests throughout Lithuania, such as paths, campsites, viewing points, etc. This network is subject to constant maintenance and enlargement with new sites being installed in both state-owned and private forests. 
It can be stated in conclusion that Lithuania develops and implements a policy for forests based on globally recognised principles of sustainable forest management, which allows conserving Lithuania forests and constantly increasing their potential by ensuring also that the balanced demand of the present-day society for forests is addressed. 
 
 
 
 
 PROMOTE PEACEFUL AND INCLUSIVE SOCIETIES FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, 
 PROVIDE ACCESS TO JUSTICE FOR ALL AND BUILD EFFECTIVE, ACCOUNTABLE AND  INCLUSIVE INSTITUTIONS AT ALL LEVELS 
 Goal 16 
 
The effective implementation of human rights and freedoms helps to ensure democratic values, enhances peace, security and democratic society, prevents aggression and humanitarian crises and reduces crime and discrimination. For this reason, it is especially important to implement international commitments in the sphere of human rights and strengthen multilateral international and regional mechanisms for ensuring human rights. Lithuania is interested in strengthening the United Nations as a centre of collective security and international law capable of responding flexibly to the changing threats of the contemporary world.  
The Constitution of the Republic of Lithuania guarantees the citizensi right to seek, receive or impart information and ideas. The freedom to express convictions, as well as to receive and impart information, may not be limited otherwise than by law when this is necessary to protect human health, honour or dignity, private life, or morals, or to defend the constitutional order. The freedom to express convictions and to impart information shall be incompatible with criminal actions n incitement to national, racial, religious, or social hatred, incitement to violence or to discrimination, as well as defamation and disinformation. 
According to information of opinion polls of the Lithuanian population, the share of people who feel safe is growing. In 2017, 77% of the respondents said they felt safe in the area of their residence n city or region. Since 2010 this indicator has increased by 19 percentage points. The share of those who believe that the risk of falling victim to a crime in the area of their residence is low has increased from 40% to 69% compared to 2010.  
Lithuania seeks to create a sustainable, responsible and healthy society. In 2014 Lithuania began implementing the National Programme for Domestic Violence Prevention and Assistance to Victims of Violence, the strategic goal of which is to reduce the level of domestic violence on the national scale. 
To prevent violence against children, the legal framework is being upgraded. In 2015, Lithuania transposed the Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography into national law. In 2016, amendments to the Criminal Code were adopted to extend the body of child purchase or sale and trafficking in human beings by providing that criminal liability arises from the commitment of acts prohibited under a criminal law for the purpose of a forced marriage or marriage of convenience. The 2017 amendments to the Law on Fundamentals of Protection of the Rights of the Child have put a ban on all forms of violence against children, including physical punishment. In 2017, the Guidelines for the Implementation of Violence Prevention in Schools came into force. These Guidelines establish a system of preventive and intervention measures at school, municipal and national levels for the creation of an environment safe from violence and bullying at schools which implement the programmes of pre-school, pre-primary and general education, vocational training and non-formal education. By 2020, almost 1 000 schools in Lithuania will be involved in the preventive programmes on combating violence and bullying at schools, and receive the funding of EUR 4 million for their implementation. 
In 2015, the Public Security Development Programme 2015n2025 was approved. The strategic goal of the Programme is to make Lithuania a safer state capable of protecting the fundamental human rights and freedoms effectively and ensuring public security.  
Lithuania aims at creating a living environment safe from criminal acts, enhancing the fight against serious crimes and crimes committed by organised criminal groups, among them the trafficking in human beings and cybercrime, reducing the probability of terror acts, ensuring the effective control of the European Union external borders, strengthening the protection from fire and emergencies and ensuring qualified response to potential or existing emergencies. 
With a view to minimising illicit financial flows, in 2015 Lithuania carried out a national risk assessment of money laundering and terrorist financing. During the assessment, more than 80 risks were identified in the law enforcement, regulatory, financial and non-financial sectors which had or could have an effect on the Lithuanian system of prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, and their potential effect on national security was evaluated. Based on the results of assessment, steps have been taken to reduce and eliminate the said risks. In 2017, a new version of the Law on the Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing was adopted to provide prerequisites for the more effective application of preventive measures to money laundering and terrorist financing and the creation of an environment unfavourable to the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing. 
To enhance the control on organised crime, in 2016 the police established a system of assessment of serious and organised crime risks enabling the police authorities to ensure the monitoring of the criminogenic situation, identify active organised crime groups and their threat levels and carry out systematic analysis of criminal intelligence information. In 2017, a national system of passenger record data was established which allows identifying persons travelling by air transport who can pose a potential threat to public security.  
With a view to reducing the damage caused to society by serous and extremely serious crimes and crimes committed by organised crime groups, Lithuania strengthens criminal intelligence and criminal prosecution for identifying criminally obtained assets, intensively develops the practical cooperation and information sharing between Lithuanian law enforcement institutions and competent authorities of other European Union member states and third countries, EU agencies, especially Europol, and participates in joint operations and joint investigation groups. Since 2012, Lithuanian law enforcement institutions have taken part in the implementation of international projects designed to implement the EU priorities approved by the European Council in the sphere of combating serious and organised crime. Lithuania is also an active participant in the activities of the Baltic Sea Task Force on Organised Crime.  
Lithuania is active in its efforts to reduce corruption and bribery in all their forms. According to the results of the 2017 survey, only 8% of the Lithuanian population have indicated that they were witnesses to or experienced events of corruption, which is less by even 17 percentage points than in 2013 (25%), and this is the largest positive change among all EU member states. The share of respondents who have given a bribe when asked has shrunk by 9 percentage points (from 29% in 2013 to 20% in 2017). As many as one-fifth of the respondents have had an opinion that the level of corruption in Lithuania decreased (6% in 2013). 
In order to ensure a long-term effective and targeted system of corruption prevention and control, in 2015 Lithuania approved the National Anti-Corruption Programme of the Republic of Lithuania for 2015n2025. The legal basis has been upgraded as well: in 2016 important amendments to the Criminal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure were adopted concerning the extension of criminal liability of legal entities and the confiscation of proceeds from bribery, in 2017 the Law on the Protection of Informants of the Republic of Lithuania was passed which will definitely contribute to the encouragement of persons to report infringements without the fear of negative countermeasures that could be taken against them at work in response to the provided information, and in 2017 amendments to the Criminal Code were adopted to increase the effectiveness of financial penalties for corruption.  
In 2017 Lithuania became a party to the Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (hereinafter \0xEBOECDi), and since then has actively participated in the OECD Working Group on Bribery in International Business Transactions.  
Article 30 of the Constitution of the Republic of Lithuania guarantees the right of access to justice to every person whose constitutional rights or freedoms are violated. Lithuanian laws stipulate that only courts may administer justice based on the principle of equality of everyone before the law and court, regardless of a personis gender, race, nationality, language, origin, social status, religion, beliefs or views, type and nature of the occupation and other circumstances. 
Persons who are incapable of defending their infringed or contested rights independently in an appropriate way due to their difficult financial situation or other circumstances may benefit from primary or secondary legal assistance under a prescribed procedure. Primary and secondary legal assistance is provided on average to about 44 000 and 41 000 persons respectively per year. Lithuania plans to extend the accessibility of legal assistance guaranteed by the state. One of such measures is the establishment of the Legal Information and Legal Assistance Information System (TEISIS) in 2020 which will enable persons to obtain relevant legal information in cyberspace quickly, and ensure the more efficient provision of legal assistance services guaranteed by the state using electronic means.  
Effective ways and forms of public participation in local public decision-making are applied which allow the population to participate in the preparation and discussion of draft solutions that promote civic initiatives. All draft laws are published on the internet, and the possibility is ensured for all stakeholders to provide their opinions in an accessible form.  
According to public surveys, in 2015n2017 the share of the population who had participated in solving local public issues within the last 12 months increased by 11 percentage points from 17% to 28%. 
To achieve that, public sector institutions provide more effective, rapid and diverse services of a better quality, the institutional framework and internal processes of the public sector are upgraded, and plans are devised to optimise the internal processes of public sector authorities by applying the \0xEBlean governancei method. It is noteworthy that, according to a public opinion poll, in 2017 the share of the Lithuanian population satisfied with the public and administrative services they had received amounted to 85%. Lithuania continues to implement active measures designed to protect fundamental human rights and freedoms effectively and ensure a safe environment for the human and community. 
 
 STRENGTHEN THE MEANS OF IMPLEMENTATION AND REVITALIZE THE  GLOBAL PARTNERSHIP FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 
  Goal 17 
 
Having become a donor country officially in 2004, Lithuania carries out continuous and effective development cooperation activities aimed at contributing to the reduction of poverty worldwide and the implementation of other United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The official development assistance (ODA) provided by Lithuania has been growing constantly: Lithuaniais ODA constituted EUR 34.6 million or 0.1% of gross national income (GNI) in 2014, EUR 43.7 million or 0.12% of GNI in 2015, and EUR 51.6 million or 0.14% of GNI in 2016. In 2017 the value of Lithuaniais ODA1 increased by 101.7% and amounted to EUR 52.5 million, but the ODA/GNI ratio dropped to 0.13% due to the more significant GNI growth rate compared to the previous year. Implementing its international ODA commitments, Lithuania strives to achieve a target of 0.33% ODA/GNI by 2030. 
Lithuania conducts development cooperation activities in accordance with the Law on Development Cooperation and Humanitarian Aid, which lays down the objectives and principles of the Lithuaniais development cooperation policy, methods and means of implementation, coordination and financing. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is responsible for shaping the Lithuaniais development cooperation policy and organising its implementation, coordination and control. The Ministry of Finance coordinates these activities with international financial institutions and is responsible for the planning of funds for membership contributions to international financial institutions in the state budget.  
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 16 
 
The Law on Development Cooperation and Humanitarian Aid provides that policy coherence is one of the key principles of the Lithuaniais development cooperation policy, i.e. account is taken of the development cooperation objectives when shaping other policies. The implementation of this principle is ensured by the National Development Cooperation Commission headed by the Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs. The National Development Cooperation Commission is comprised of representatives of state and municipal institutions and agencies, non-governmental organisations and business associations operating in the area of development cooperation. The Commission submits proposals to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with respect to the improvement of inter-institutional coordination, regulation and international cooperation, discusses reports on development cooperation activities of state and municipal institutions and agencies and assesses their compliance with the objectives and principles of the Lithuaniais development cooperation policy, and deals with other issues related to development cooperation. 
With a view to implementing the international ODA commitments and contributing to the implementation of the goals of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in aid recipient countries, in 2016 Lithuania approved the Inter-Institutional Action Plan on Development Cooperation 2017n2019. The plan provides development cooperation policy guidelines and means for their implementation. Taking into consideration the financial resources allocated to development cooperation and accumulated development cooperation experience, Lithuania seeks to contribute to the implementation of all Sustainable Development Goals in aid recipient countries, but priority is given to the following six sustainable development goals out of  17: poverty reduction, quality education, gender equality, mitigation of impacts of climate change, peace and justice, effective institutions and partnership for implementation of the goals. The Inter-Institutional Action Plan on Development Cooperation is updated and adjusted annually in order to mobilise the efforts and funds of national and municipal authorities in implementing the objectives of the Lithuaniais development cooperation policy. The number of institutions involved in the implementation of the plan has increased from 13 to 17 over the year. 
Lithuaniais international ODA commitments are also included in the Action Plan on the Implementation of the Government Programme 2016n2020, which provides for increased assistance to partner countries to ensure that in the long-term perspective Lithuaniais ODA complies with Lithuaniais international commitments. All ministries must provide reports on the implementation of this action and indicator on an annual basis.  
To ensure the effectiveness of the development cooperation activities, improve the quality of projects and reduce the administrative costs, Lithuania devotes much attention to the upgrading of the legal basis. In accordance with the new edition of the Law on Development Cooperation and Humanitarian Aid, which came into effect on 1 January 2017, the public establishment Central Project Management Agency (CPMA) has been entrusted with functions that will allow the CPMA to gradually evolve into a development cooperation agency of Lithuania. 
The priority of Lithuaniais bilateral development cooperation is the Eastern Partnership states of Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova, Belarus, Armenia and Azerbaijan, where the assistance provided by Lithuania promotes social and economic reforms, supports political and economic integration with the European Union. To contribute to the solution of challenges caused by the world migration crisis, in addition to the Eastern Partnership states recently Lithuania has also chosen the countries of migration origin and transit as a geographical priority of development cooperation. In 2015n2017, Lithuania implemented development cooperation projects in Africa (Nigeria, Mali and South Africa), Middle East (Palestine and Jordan) and Asia (Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bhutan, Mongolia, Myanmar, Turkey, Malaysia, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan). In 2015n2017, Lithuania realised 265 development cooperation projects in the spheres of administrative and institutional capacity building, the legal sector, energy, health care and education, and projects designed to strengthen civil society, implement equal opportunities and womenis rights and support the freedom of the media and pluralism. In 2017 the geography of Lithuanian bilateral development cooperation expanded to 24 states. 
The strength of Lithuania as a donor country is its experience in creating a democratic Lithuanian state and a market economy. Lithuania effectively shares this experience with the countries of the European Union Eastern Partnership and spreads it in other regions undergoing transformation. Lithuania is well familiar with the political system and economic, social and cultural features and specific problems of the neighbouring Eastern states. Its growing experience as a donor allows producing an improved assessment of the needs of partner countries and exploiting Lithuaniais comparative advantage against other donor countries more effectively. 

Almost 75% of Lithuaniais development cooperation assistance is provided through the participation in the European Union and United Nations programmes, by way of mandatory and voluntary contributions to the activities of other funds, international organisations and international financial institutions that implement and coordinate development cooperation, including a part of the contributions to the European Union budget and the European Development Fund. Providing multilateral development assistance, Lithuania supports the poorest world countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and other regions. Lithuania also provides humanitarian aid to victims of natural disasters or armed conflicts by transferring the funds to the United Nations specialised agencies, the International Committee of the Red Cross and other international organisations. In 2015-2017, Lithuania allocated funds for humanitarian aid for conflict affected Ukraine, Syria and Iraq, for hunger crisis-stricken Yemen, South Sudan, Somalia, Nigeria and Ethiopia, for combating Ebola virus; for refugees of Afghanistan, Palestine and Myanmar, for victims of natural disasters in Albania, Dominica, Ecuador, Fiji, Haiti, Georgia, Macedonia, Malawi, Nepal, Sierra Leone, Shri Lanka and Vanuatu. 
Global challenges demand a more active involvement and participation of all Lithuanian national and municipal authorities, non-governmental organisations and business. To involve into development cooperation as many actors as possible, in 2017 the National Development Cooperation Commission was expanded to include a representative of organisations that unite Lithuanian businesses, considering the fact that the participation of business in development cooperation is important not only in terms of its financial contribution but also as a source for generating new ideas and transferring business experience. The Lithuanian business contribution is especially weighty in development cooperation projects funded under the Climate Change Special Programme managed by the Ministry of Environment, and implemented by Lithuanian companies in Malaysia, Moldova and Georgia in the sphere of renewable energy source technology development.  
Lithuanian non-governmental organisations (NGOs) are important partners of public sector in the formation and implementation of the development cooperation policy. The composition of the National Development Cooperation Commission includes two \0xEBumbrellai non-governmental development cooperation organisations, which unite 37 organisations. The input of these organisations is especially significant in the spheres of global education, public information on the importance and benefits of development cooperation and promotion of volunteering. Lithuanian non-governmental organisations get actively involved not only in national but also in the European Union supported projects intended for the development of global citizenship competences and public information on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Non-governmental organisations of Lithuania or a partner country implement also the greater part of Lithuaniais development cooperation projects: in 2017 only 22% of all projects were implemented by the public sector, and the rest were realised by NGOs and business.  
Although the support of the Lithuanian public for assistance to partner countries is growing (according to an opinion poll, in 2015 about 44% of the respondents approved the idea that Lithuania should provide assistance to developing countries and thus contribute to the international efforts to reduce poverty and migration flows, and in 2017 this figure increased to 58%), it is still inadequate and confirms the need for increasing the Lithuanian public awareness of global problems and challenges and an understanding that each citizen can contribute to their solution. Therefore, Lithuania devotes much attention to the activities designed to introduce the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals to the Lithuanian public. Lithuania organises documentary film festivals, photography exhibitions, interactive events, \0xEBbrain fightsi and discussions, disseminates information on television and radio shows and social media, and looks for innovative, attractive and accessible forms to present the information. For example, Lithuanian development cooperation projects have been presented in the form of cartoons, radio quizzes have been organised, United Nations video advertisements on the 2030 Agenda have been shown on Lithuanian television, in cinemas and public transport, and information campaigns at schools and hackathons have been held. The projects are implemented in different regions of Lithuania involving partners from nongovernmental organisations and the education, academic and private sectors. It has become a tradition for Lithuania to summarise the results of development cooperation at an annual development cooperation conference held in December. The theme of the conference held in 2016 was \0xEB2030 Sustainable Development Goals: the contribution and responsibility of Lithuaniai, and of that in 2017 \0xEBEnhancing partnership to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Developmenti. At a conference, project implementers and other participants present the results of their most successful development cooperation projects, share their insights on how to ensure the continuity of activities, enhance existing and establish new partnerships. The discussions look for answers to the questions of whether the experience transferred by Lithuania is effective in creating responsible and strong societies and how Lithuania can contribute to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals in partner countries in a more effective way. 
In conclusion, it is important to note that one of the underlying principles of the Lithuaniais development cooperation policy is partnership with a partner country, the international community of donor countries, international organisations, international financial institutions, as well as local and regional government authorities and civil society, including non-governmental organisations and the private sector in Lithuania and abroad. Therefore, Lithuania has chosen Sustainable Development Goal 17 as one of its sectoral development cooperation priorities since the implementation of the 2030 Agenda is only possible through partnership and joint effort. 

 	 

CONCLUSIONS  

 
Implementing the 2030 Agenda both at the national and international levels is very important for Lithuania. Lithuania has carried out analysis of the compatibility of the 2030 Agenda with the national strategic planning documents, including the National Strategy for Sustainable Development. It has been found that most of the United Nations sustainable development goals and targets are in fact reflected in Lithuaniais strategic planning documents.  
With a view to ensuring the compatibility and integration of economic development, solution of social problems and environmental protection, Lithuania has created an institutional and strategic planning system resting on the principles of sustainable development. When preparing strategic documents in their respective spheres, all national authorities are guided by higher-level strategies, in particular the National Strategy for Sustainable Development and Lithuaniais Progress Strategy \0xEBLithuania 2030i. This ensures the compatibility of different policy areas and the integrated solution of problems.  
A group of experts has been established for the preparation of the VNR on the 2030 Agenda, including specialists of numerous ministries and representatives of non-governmental organisations and municipalities.  
It can be stated in conclusion that the preparation of the 2030 Agenda review has been a useful practice that has helped to strengthen cooperation among the national authorities and the relationships with nongovernmental organisations which should be enhanced further. This practice has encouraged Lithuania to formulate and highlight its priority areas, including the reduction of poverty, social exclusion and income inequality, promotion of employment, enhancement of public health, improvement of the quality and availability of health care services, development of an innovative economy and smart energy, quality education and development cooperation. 
Lithuania has made some progress, but has also encountered great challenges in the sphere of reducing poverty, social exclusion and income inequality and promoting employment. These are priority issues laid down in the major national and international strategic documents. In 2016, 30% of the population were exposed to poverty or social exclusion in Lithuania. To solve these problems, Lithuania has implemented significant reforms which will contribute to the increase of retirement pensions, promotion of employment opportunities, creation of more favourable financial conditions for families and increase of state subsidised income. 
The enhancement of public health and the improvement of the quality and availability of health care services are inseparable from sustainable development. Public health is a national asset and capital protecting and fostering which allows ensuring a countryis social and economic development. Healthy and working people are a guarantor of economic growth and sustainable development of a country. Seeking a healthier society, Lithuania devotes great attention to alcohol prevention, nutrition and morbidity reduction. To increase the availability of quality and acceptable public health care services, Lithuania develops and implements integrated health care service models, analyses and assesses possibilities for providing new health care services that meet the present-day needs of the population, and increases the diversity of such services.  
Innovative solutions and smart energy constitute the basis of the modern and sustainable economy of Lithuania. By encouraging enterprises to use raw materials efficiently, optimise their production processes and reduce waste generation and air pollution, Lithuania attaches a great deal of importance to innovation and promotion of investment in new technologies. The implementation of the National Energy Independence Strategy ensures energy independence and strengthens the energy security and competitiveness of the country. Lithuania has built a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal and launched the intersystem power links Lithuania-Sweden (NordBalt) and Lithuania-Poland (LitPol Link). RES energy in the final energy consumption in Lithuania accounts for 26% and heat from RES exceeds 46%. 
Quality education is another very important goal for Lithuania. To ensure inclusive and equitable quality education, Lithuania is increasing the availability and quality of pre-school education, focusing on the quality of general education, enhancing student achievements and developing inclusive education. The Lithuanian population is among the most educated populations. In 2016, the share of 20n24-year persons with at least secondary education amounted to 91.7%. The shares of women and men differ slightly (in 2016, men accounted for 89.3% and women for 94.2%). Since 2011 Lithuania has been the leader among the EU member states in terms of persons aged 25 to 64 with secondary or higher education, and according to the number of 30n34-year-old people with higher education. To provide more favourable conditions for quality higher education, it is planned to reform the network of higher educational establishments. In 2018, free Bachelor studies are to be introduced, and a model of funding the studies of Lithuanian citizens at the worldis best higher schools is to be launched. 
Despite the challenges arising at the national level, Lithuania has highlighted development cooperation as one of its priorities. Lithuania contributes to poverty reduction worldwide and implementation of other United Nations sustainable development goals by providing multilateral and bilateral assistance to partner countries. It is important to note that one of the underlying principles of the Lithuanian development cooperation policy is partnership with a partner country, the international community of donor countries, international organisations, international financial institutions, as well as local and regional government authorities and civil society, including non-governmental organisations and the private sector in Lithuania and abroad.  
It can be maintained in conclusion that the actions of Lithuania help to implement the 2030 Agenda in the country and contribute to the implementation of this Agenda throughout the world. We understand that we are residents of one home and we cannot remain indifferent to each other or live at the expense of the future generations.
