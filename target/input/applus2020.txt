Our people’s capabilities and care have demonstrated the resilience of the Applus+ Group under the most challenging of economic and societal circumstances. We are impressed and delighted with their proactivity and actions.The pandemic has starkly demonstrated the world’s interconnectivity, so we are immensely proud that the Applus+ Group immediately worked with a wide group of stakeholders to make a difference. Our experts quickly developed testing and certification for life-saving medical Christopher Cole 	equipment such as mechanical ventilators. Health and Chairman of the Board of Directors	safety are central to our TIC services and naturally to our people’s wellbeing, so we introduced preventive training and a range of new safety protocols in response to coronavirus. The company-wide annual Safety Day 2020 continued as a new remote, digital edition taking up these themes. Sadly, the Group suffered two unconnected work-place fatalities in 2020, and our heartfelt condolences and support were provided to the employees’ families and the colleagues impacted. The Board was immediately informed of these sad events and a robust investigation followed.Inevitably, the Group was materially impacted in 2020 by the pandemic, and despite an encouraging recovery in the second half, the year recorded lower revenue and profit compared to 2019. We delivered a gradual recovery from the third to fourth quarter, with a double-digit operating profit margin in the second half. For the full year in 2020, revenue was down 12% to €1,558 million and adjusted operating profit was down 40% to €118 million. Fernando Basabe Chief Executive Officer (CEO)
The Group’s proactive financial management resulted in an exceptionally strong year for cash flow and liquidity, with adjusted free cash flow increasing by almost 21%, or €39 million, to €226 million, and the Group ended the year with liquid resources in excess of €546 million. This strong financial position allowed the acquisition strategy to resume in the final quarter, in which the Group purchased four highly strategic, margin and earnings accretive companies. The acquisitions further position the Group towards business lines with higher growth and margins, and were additional to the two made in the first quarter. We are monitoring many opportunities and confident of continued success, whilst remaining disciplined on price. The adjusted earnings-per-share fell to €0.33, and statutory earnings-per-share was negative after the one-off impairment in the year’s first half, with no further impairments. Following the dividend cancellation in 2020, which was one of several measures for financial resilience taken at the time, the Board will recommend the dividend at 15 cents per share in 2021 for payment on 8th July 2021. Looking ahead, the Group will aim to increase the dividend payment annually.The Group’s efforts for a more sustainable world was confirmed with classification by MSCI ESG Research, the CDP and continued inclusion in the FTSE4Good IBEX Index. In 2020, we amended the former CSR Policy to the revised ESG Policy, and approved 11 specific targets to further integrate the principles of good governance across the Group. These actions strengthen our commitment to the UN’s Global Compact at “Advanced Level”, and we continue to report and implement the SDGs adopted.Diversity in leadership roles also received a further boost on the Board, amending the Director’s Selection Policy to reflect the next goal of the Board comprising 40% women by 2022, along with measures for more women in directorship roles. Initiatives to support our people’s satisfaction and talent were also recognised by wide-ranging industry awards for programmes championing employee-engagement, diversity and inclusion. For more sustainable operations, Applus+ stepped up measures to reduce our global energy consumption, with 23% of electricity consumption at our facilities from renewable sources in 2020. This is achieved by following a medium-term carbon neutrality strategy, seeking to use resources efficiently and working to deliver sustainable value for society. The Group added more electric vehicles to our fleet, which helped reduce GHG emissions intensity by 19%. In contributions to sustainable development, the Group expanded our technical expertise at new solar parks, wind farms and for hydrogenenergy plants planned for the future. In sectors radically pursuing energy transition, our divisional teams’ wide collaborations continued to push innovations in the next-generation electric vehicles and to reduce fuel use in aerospace. In 2020, we generated approximately €200 million of revenue, or 13% of Group revenue, from what we term Green Revenues. Going forward, new opportunities outweigh the risks in the Group’s markets as the world transitions to a low-carbon economy.Closing comments2020 was a challenging year and the Group’s management responded by prioritising our people’s wellbeing, clients’ requirements, Group liquidity, operating costs and technological advancement. With considerable remaining uncertainty in every country and in our end-markets, our guidance assumes conditions today will either remain the same or not deteriorate. In 2021, we expect total revenue to grow by at least double digits at constant exchange rates, from both organic and the acquisitions made, and for the margin to improve to close to 10%. The Group will also continue to make acquisitions supported by liquidity and leverage headroom.Applus+ will continue to do what we do best. We will provide superior safety and quality in our services to a broad range of clients around the world, with rising demand due to greater scrutiny and regulation over more complex and varied products, infrastructure and assets. The Group will allocate excess cash flow to support organic revenue growth, supplementing with acquisitive growth that diversifies the business towards higher margins and with more sustainable, longer term revenue-generating streams.Our experienced Management and Board will continue to be alert and agile in progressing the growth and performance of the business, whilst being ever mindful of risks.Key to this performance and the Group’s strength is the continued trust and support of our people, shareholders, clients and partners. Working together, we will achieve a safer, more sustainable, diverse and inclusive world.GRI 102-2	GRI 102-4	GRI 102-6	GRI 102-7The Applus+ Group is a leading global testing, inspection and certification (TIC) company. We provide innovative TIC services to national and multi-national companies on all continents.

Despite the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the Group’s liquidity and strong cash flow enabled the company to make two in the Automotive Division, three in the Laboratories Division and one in the Energy & Industry Division, made in December 2020 and which will be closed during the first quarter of 2021.These acquisitions support our growth through sustainable services and therefore reinforce the resilience of the Group’s services portfolio.In October, Applus+ acquired the total share capital in Besikta Bilprovning i Sverige Holding AB (Besikta), a leading statutory-vehicle-In February, Applus+ acquired the company ITV Canarias, expanding the number of local stations in the Automotive Division within these Spanish territorial islands.inspection company in Sweden with 185 stations and 560 employees.The market in Sweden is liberalised, so there is no contract-renewal risk; on the contrary, the acquisition presents new opportunities for growth through investments in other stations in strategic locations with a strong potential.With these two acquisitions, the Group, through the Automotive Division, is reinforcing our global leadership position in services for statutory vehicle inspection. The Group provides these services in 13 countries, which inspect vehicles for compliance with technical safety specifications to lower accident rates on roads and comply with the applicable emission legislation, contributing to climate-change mitigation.In February, the Laboratories Division acquired ZYX Metrology, a metrology laboratory located in Ripollet (Barcelona) to expand its portfolio in metrology services.This laboratory makes use of state-of-the-art 3D scanning and measurement technologies, providing dimensional metrology, digitalisation and reverse-engineering services for products and components from sectors such as automotive and transport.At the end of 2020, and in line with its growth strategy in the field of electric and electronic testing services, the Laboratories Division acquired two new companies, QPS is an electric and electronic product certification company, well established in North America.

This move strengthened its position as global provider for the testing of automotive components and the certification of electric and electronic equipment, as well as consolidating its presence in China and North America.The Reliable Analysis laboratories are located in China and the USA, are a reference in the automotive sector, and have unique capabilities for electric-vehicle component testing.The acquisition of Reliable Analysis increases the capabilities of the Laboratories Division as testing provider for electric vehicles and strengthens the Division’s position in the Chinese market, the fastest growing market in the world in this field.In December, Energy & Industry Division acquired Soil and Foundation Company Limited and Geotechnical and Environmental Company (together “SAFCO Group”), a leading construction testing and inspection services company in Saudi Arabia. SAFCO Group is the largest and oldest company in Saudi Arabia to provide construction-based testing and inspection services, building this position over the past 40 years. It provides on-site and laboratory-based testing for the materials used in construction projects as diverse as small commercial buildings to mega projects, as well as soil investigation services and environmental inspection and consulting.   It has a strong reputation and good brand recognition in the industry, which will immediately support the expansion of Applus+ delivering services for construction, building and environmental products testing in the region where Applus+ already currently serves mainly other end-markets.The Applus+ Group offers innovate testing, inspection and certification (TIC) services to companies in a wide variety of industrial sectors all over the world though our four divisions		Aerospace	Telecommunications		Oil and gas	AutomotiveENERGY & INDUSTRY DIVISIONWe assist our clients in developing and monitoring industrial processes, protecting assets and increasing operational and environmental safety.LABORATORIES DIVISIONWe develop testing, engineering and certification services for industries such as aerospace, automotive, electronics, IT and construction.AUTOMOTIVE DIVISIONWe offer statutory-vehicleinspection services to comply with regulations for technical safetyand environmental protection.IDIADA DIVISIONWe offer design, engineering, testing and homologation services to the leading automotive companies in the world.23.387employees+70countries61.325suppliersAt Applus+, we generate value by responsibly conducting our business activities.

These innovations assist in implementing actions to mitigate climate change, drive progress in local communities and achieve advances which improve public safety.We develop and deliver our services and activities so they are recognised for strong social and ethical responsibility. This approach contributes to maintain customer loyalty and safeguards the Group’s position as a trusted partner. Leadership: Be market leaders in our verticals • Testing, inspection, certification in chosen key geographies and market sectors• Inspection and NDT mission-critical services for oil, gas and power end-markets• Statutory vehicle inspection across Europe and the Americas• Automotive proving grounds, homologation services and passive-safety testing facilities• Laboratory testing and metrology services in Spain and other geographies		Innovation and Technology: Offer the best technical solutions• Target investment in proprietary technology and know-how• Plan to accelerate the digitalisation of the operations and the development of new digital services.• Deliver technical solutions to reduce risk more efficiently for our clients and the public • Innovate TIC practices by working with global companies, government legislators and industry associations		Trusted Partner: Build long-term relationships• Nurture long-term relationships and Master Service Agreements with blue-chip clients• Provide essential and regulatory-driven, mission-critical services cost effectivelyThe Group in 2018 set three year financial and non-financial objectives, all of which are aligned with our strategy and within the framework defined in the company’s purpose and values.The three main drivers are organic and inorganic income growth, margin improvements, and cash flow generation for strategic acquisitions and shareholder dividends.The crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic, with its huge impact globally, has also affected some of the objectives defined in our three-year plan set out until 2020. Nonetheless, other objectives have been well met despite the pandemic, and therefore the Group made six acquisitions throughout 2020 thanks to the Group’s robust cash-flow generation and strong liquidity.In 2021, the Group will focus efforts on recovering pre-pandemic levels of sales and margins and managing the integration of the acquisitions made in 2020, while also continuing to promote our sustainability measures to meet our environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) objectives:GOALS FOR 2021We expect a gradual, declining impact of the pandemic on our business activities in 2021, following which the Applus+ Group plans to develop a new three-year plan for the period 2022-2024.DELIVERING WORLD-CLASS TIC SERVICESAt Applus+, we implement our business strategy driven by our mission to be a world leader in our TIC markets and to create trust for our stakeholders by offering the most innovative services and managing our company with a sustainability approach that achieves optimal financial and non-financial results. The Applus+ brand defines our success to deliver world-class TIC services: a global leader, a trusted partner and with a passion for improvement. These three pillars underpin the Group’s long-term growth within our TIC markets, supported by strategic investment into technology, innovation and human capital. With four attributes in each pillar, they reflect both how we deliver service excellence and how to attain global leadership.

SUSTAINABILITY FRAMEWORKGRI 207-1GRI 207-2Financial managementThe Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and the Vice-Presidents of our four divisions are responsible for managing the Applus+ Group’s financial results.Through executive committees, the members of the executive management team, and the directors of the functional corporate areas, analyse the information and economic results reported by the Group’s four divisions. Internal Control SystemApplus+ prepares the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards approved by the European Union (IFRS-EU) and conforming to Regulation (EC) 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and Council. Applus+ has an IFRS Manual to apply the Group’s accounting principles and standards homogenously within all of its dependent companies, as well as its valuation criteria. Correspondingly, the Group uses a unique reporting package with a standardised accounting system, applicable to all of the companies to guarantee a consistent approach across the Group.	Applus+ DivisionsFurthermore, Applus+ has designed and developed an Internal Control System over Financial Information (ICFR), which establishes the processes carried out by the Board of Directors, the Audit Committee, the management and the Group’s personnel to ensure a reasonable level of security in relation to the reliability of the information published. The Board of Directors is ultimately responsible for the existence and maintenance of the ICFR, and it is led by the Audit Committee. The model implemented by the Applus+ Group is fully described in Section F of the Annual Corporate Governance Report.Each year, the proper implementation of the ICFR and the the Group have both been in compliance since being a listed company in 2014.To better meet the requirements of Spanish law 11/2018 on non-financial information, Applus+ is continuing its efforts to expand the content of the reporting package, which is used by all of the companies in the Group, by introducing non-financial information (related to social, environmental and governance topics, in addition to other information). Currently, some information has already been included, and other topics will be included in 2021 financial year. Tax contributionThe Group’s fiscal strategy, approved by the Board of Directors, focuses on:• Ensuring responsible compliance with the tax laws in force while safeguarding corporate interests. • Being aligned with the business strategy and values of the Applus+ Group, which require the strict observance of the law and the criteria set by the regulatory bodies governing our businesses. • Developing and implementing best practices in tax governance. • Combining compliance with tax obligations together with the commitment to create value for our shareholders.We exhaustively monitor compliance with our tax obligations in all of the countries in which we operate through the Applus+ GRG tool.We operate in compliance with the internal procedures we have defined, which set out how the Corporate Tax Department should be informed to minimise any possible sanctions in the event of inspection notifications. There were no significant fiscal sanctions in the financial year ending 31st December 2020.Each quarter, the Audit Committee reviews all fiscal risks that could materialise, when applicable, derived from verifications by the relevant authorities, and thereby the Group monitors the fiscal risks to minimise such exposure.The employees with responsibilities to fulfil fiscal obligations are trained according to what is considered relevant, and when applicable, the Group also has external fiscal advice to ensure the company fulfils its obligations in this area.A key priority for the Applus+ Group is to fulfil the company’s obligations to pay taxes in accordance with the regulatory requirements applicable in each territory, with the aim of creating value in all of the countries where the Group operates through tax payments that fulfil the company’s fiscal obligations. The Applus+ Group paid 16.7 million of euros in business tax in the 2020 financial year.Off-shore Eddy Current TestingRisk managementThe Board of Directors and the Audit Committee of the Applus+ Group have clear responsibilities for risk management and control policies, as well as for the periodical evaluation of the company’s financial and nonfinancial risks. The Applus+ Group manages risks by implementing the company’s Risk Management Policy and Procedure.In addition, the Group has a Criminal Risk Map and a Handbook of Criminal Risk Management and Crime Prevention System. Therefore, under the impetus of the Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) Responsibility Committee, the Group has revised and strengthened our Compliance Management System (CMS).To fulfil and improve risk management, the management team periodically updates the Risk Map, which identifies and quantifies the main risks that could affect the Group’s strategic objectives. These risks include all the factors regarded as critical for the Group’s business activities from the strategic, operational, financial, legal and compliance perspectives, and in terms of sustainability. The Risk Map encompasses social and environmental risks, including risks related to climate change.The risk-management model implemented in the Group primarily comprises the following stages:The Risk Map, and its associated action plans, is revised by the Audit Committee twice yearly and by the Board of Directors annually.This process, which covers the four divisions and geographic regions of the Group’s operations, guarantees informed decision-making, which improves the Group’s risk-management performance by tracking the Key Risk Indicators (KRI) defined for each risk. These indicators are periodically evaluated by the Audit Committee, and the Group develops the action plans needed to manage those risks appropriately. Non-financial management: Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) approachThe Applus+ Group demonstrates our commitment to sustainability through our ESG Policy (Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance), previously the CSR Policy, published on the Group’s website. The Policy is defined and approved by the Board of Directors in accordance with our values of integrity, transparency, impartiality and independence, and responsibility, and it is implemented in all of the Group’s regions and four divisions. We implement this approach in the short- and medium-term through lines of action related to each of the five pillars underpinning our policy.OUR PROFESSIONALS• To achieve our teams’ commitment through periodic training. • To supervise the implementation of all the Group’s policies and procedures related to the protection of human rights, nondiscrimination and equal opportunities.• To continue implementing and following the action plans designed to improve and increase our professionals’ satisfaction and commitment.• To continue enriching our programme of activities geared at improving our talent management.• To promote new initiatives related to diversity, inclusion and equality.• To continue improving our system of managing workplace health and safety, including continuous training in preventing workplace risks, with the goal of protecting our employees with a zero-accident approach. ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE • To monitor the implementation of the new recommendations in the Code of Good Governance, following its adoption in December 2020 and published by the CNMV in June 2020• To launch training in 2021 on the Group’s policies and procedures to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which was postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic, targeted at EU employees and including the companies acquired by the Group. • To analyse and implement the changes arising from the new law amending the revised text of the Corporate Enterprises Act, approved by Royal Legislative Decree 1/2010, 2nd July 2010, and other financial regulations, with regards to fostering the long-term involvement of the shareholders in listed companies.• To maintain international efforts that guarantee the effective implementation of CMS policies in all four divisions and their regions, following the consolidation in 2020 of our policies and procedures forming part of the CMS.• To continue to guarantee compliance with the Global Anticorruption Policy and Procedure; and to continuously improve our crime-prevention model through new developments in the future.COMMITMENT TO STAKEHOLDERS• To promote social action in relation to local communities and to foster the autonomy of our local teams to implement specific social-action programmes so we can better adapt to the reality of each region.• To continue to gradually increase the percentage of suppliers covered by our standardisation processes, until reaching 100% in the short-term.• To hold annual meetings on corporate governance to maintain constructive dialogue with our institutional investors and proxy advisors, in line with our Policy for Communication and Contact with Shareholders, Institutional Investors and Proxy Advisors.INNOVATION• To bolster our efforts in developing new technologies and digital solutions which enable us to increase safety, service quality and environmental safeguards.• To promote and extend our innovation activities throughout the company for our ESG principles to be included in employee training, in the services we develop internally, and in services provided to our clients.SUSTAINABLE PERFORMANCE• To continue our efforts for minimising energy and water consumption, as well as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through local, high-efficiency programmes.• To foster the use of renewable energies and implement actions that act on the causes of the most significant environmental impacts (eco-efficient vehicle fleet, illumination programmes in our offices, solar panels, etc.)• To enhance our catalogue of sustainable services, especially those that assist our clients to lower their environmental impact in general and those related to climate change in particular. Awards and recognitionsAs in other years, Applus+ has been widely acknowledged by many institutions for our professional performance in different areas of business management, as well as for the Group’s deep involvement in issues related to ESG.

Our aim is to become technological partners with our clients when developing new products and implementing new technologies, which allow us to offer more advanced services with greater value.One of the Group’s priorities is to provide a response to our clients’ needs and seek new ways of interacting with them, making full use of the possibilities of new digital technologies, as well as to evolve with our partners when adapting to rapidly changing environments occurring within the markets where we operate. This was especially important in 2020 to assist clients in overcoming or minimising the impact of the crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic.In this context, the synergies between our divisions are a key asset. These broaden our horizons and capabilities to provide a better response for both our internal challenges and those of our clients, allowing the Group to create new services or improve existing ones and adapt them to different scenarios in different sectors, while taking advantage of new business opportunities.For this, we continue to have creative and motivated experts, with knowledge and experience in many disciplines. This year, eight hundred and sixty-five of our people were involved in and contributed to projects delivering innovations, dedicating more than 286,000 hours. To continue providing innovative solutions to our clients’ businesses and in markets affected by the global pandemic, our divisions have devised new plans to effectively optimise our innovation projects.Our teams worked on 177 projects for research, development and innovation, many of which were already in progress and will continue in the years ahead.A total amount of 13 patents were granted from 5 different existing families, resulting in a new total of 111 valid patents, while the number of active patent families remains at 30. During this year, according to the optimisation of patent portfolio initiated in previous years, only one new application for an existing patent family was filed.In 2020, our innovation management activity has enhanced the following aspects:• With regards to the internal innovation activities, our efforts focused on accelerating the development of digital tools specially to offer remote services in order to continue the company’s operations under the new working scenario, with the utmost security and safety for our clients and employees and a high quality of service. • The activities relating to digital technologies have been crucial to minimise the impact of the pandemic, and we have increased the speed of the rollout plan. We have launched new services to respond to the requirements arising from the crisis, and some pre-existing services have been adapted to respond to the needs of our clients and the wider society. • Some financed projects have been postponed to facilitate their proper performance and completion, as well as to reduce the impact due to the lockdown period, especially with regards to laboratory activities.At the beginning of the health crisis, conferences and technological meetings stopped across the globe, and consequently, we reduced our participation at these industry events. Latterly, we regained our contributions as online events became widely initiated, and similarly, our four divisions set up webinars to deliver training courses, which addressed our clients’ requirements. Through these measures, we have maintained our technological presence across our TIC markets in a complicated year.Digital transformation projectIntroducing technological advances through innovation in our business lines is one of the strategic practices that drives Applus+ to be a global leader in the TIC sector. We evolve together with our clients in adopting digital technologies in business.To accelerate the digitalisation within our operations and to develop new digital services, we have multiple initiatives, including the Digital Transformation Project launched in 2018 that promotes digitalisation across the Group by following a clearly defined roadmap.

The resulting automated vehicle could be used as a tool for validating systems and also as a prototype vehicle to develop new concepts. The automated vehicle has been designed following the functional safety standard (ISO26262), allowing IDIADA to demonstrate its capabilities in this field across all levels of development. Connected and Autonomous vehicles will gradually gain traction in the market over the next two decades, from about 4% of the global market for light vehicles in 2025, rising to approximately 41% in 2030 and 75% by 2035. The automotive industry is currently developing new concepts and prototypes to add ever more functionalities to their vehicles and increase the level of autonomy of their vehicles. The IDIADA Division, as an automotive engineering partner, is already working on projects to develop these kinds of systems.High-technological value testing and data-modelling solutions for the automotive industryThe Laboratories and IDIADA Divisions have brought together their knowledge and experience in the fields of testing, crash tests and simulation for the automotive industry to develop a unique process for providing the necessary material models used in full-vehicle crash test simulations.On-Board Fuel Consumption Meter (OBFCM)In 2020, the adaptation of OBD (On-Board Device) systems, already used in the statutory-vehicleinspection centres at Applus+ in Spain, was developed to include the monitoring of a vehicle’s cumulative fuel consumption. The meter, which is compulsory in new vehicles from 2020, is being spearheaded by the European Commission, and it will provide better data on the real consumption of new vehicles. With this new monitoring system, the Automotive Division’s statutory-vehicle-inspection stations will combat both local pollutants and the excess emissions of greenhouse gases.New remote-inspection servicesWithin the context of the coronavirus pandemic, remote-inspection solutions are having an important impact at many levels. First, remote inspections preserve public health, and secondly, they enable the activity to continue while lowering the environmental impact through the elimination of travel.The Energy & Industry Division has developed new remoteinspection services using a variety of technologies and strategies applicable to different use-cases. One of these is remote vendor inspection, a collaborative system based on augmented reality through a TRA (Technical Remote Assistant), which enables the client to ascertain the state of their assets or suppliers remotely, without impacting on the accuracy of the information and decision-making.Another solution developed is remote inspection of pipelines, in which experts located anywhere in the world can check, analyse and report on the inspection without actually being present at the site, with the consequent impact on lowering the number of personnel required to travel to the inspection site.The Technology Centre of Rotterdam has developed a cloud-based communication system to remotely support IWEX and Rotoscan ultrasonic inspections of newly built pipeline in the field from the operator’s centralised location.Benchmark supplier for the aerospace sectorThroughout 2020, the Laboratories Division carried out multiple high-complexity projects for the aerospace industry, including:A test bench for helicopter gearboxes, which allows the gearboxes from several helicopter models to be tested. For this project, the Division provided a turnkey solution including design, manufacturing and commissioning of the test bench.A test bench for high velocity impacts, the “Gas Gun”, allowing for high-velocity tests to be performed with several types of projectiles on any part of the fuselage, the motor or the cockpit of an aircraft or drone.A+ Glide Forming: the carbon-fibre component manufacturing technology developed by the Laboratories Division has been deemed as key technology for two innovative, complex geometry component-forming projects using thermostable and thermoplastic composite materials.Innovation through collaborationNHYTE project Throughout 2020, the Laboratories Division was involved in several projects financed by the European H2020 programme and the Clean Sky2 initiative, and it collaborated closely with the European industry, universities and technological centres. In October 2020, the NHYTE Project came to an end. Its main objectives were the development of more environmentally-friendly manufacturing processes of aero-structures and the integration of a new hybrid thermoplastic composite material with multifunctional capabilities and reduced recycling costs. Some of the results obtained were presented at the EASN Conference 2020 and are documented in the article “Virtual testing activities for the development of a hybrid thermoplastic material for the NHYTE project”.MuCCA ProjectThe Multi-Car Collision Avoidance Project (MuCCA) was a 30-month project worth £4.6 million, financed by the Centre for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CCAV) as part of the Innovate UK programme. The consortium, comprising the IDIADA Division at Applus+, Connected Places Catapult, Cosworth, Cranfield University, Westfield Sportscars and SBD Automotive, has developed a nextgeneration controller to help avoid multiple-car collisions on motorways. The technology primarily seeks to avoid accidents, but if unavoidable, the MuCCA system tries to minimise the consequences of an accident. Through the MuCCA project, solutions for the numerous technical challenges facing CAV vehicles have been tested and fine-tuned. These were shown at the online seminar which closed the project and at the Cenex 2020 event, at which one of our engineers from the IDIADA Division in the United Kingdom delivered a virtual talk to share the conclusions of the project.Participation in at technical conferences and sponsorshipIn 2020, the Laboratories Division participated at multiple digital events to present its solutions and technological advances: • Composite thermoplastic materials for the manufacturing of aerospace components  Our experts conducted a webinar at the ITHEC conferences to present the A+ Glide Forming complex geometry part-manufacturing technology and its applications on composite thermoplastic materials. • Materials testing for simulation  The experts of the Division showcased solutions in the field of simulation at the NAFEMS 2020 Nordic Regional Conference and at the Global Altair Technology Conference 2020, both on an international scale.  Furthermore, the Division was “silver sponsor” at the LS-DYNA Conference 2020, “associate sponsor” at the SPE ACCE 2020 Virtual Forum, “silver sponsor” at the SPE Thermoplastic Elastomers Virtual Conference and “premier sponsor” of the 2020 Global 3DEXPERIENCE Modelling & Simulation Virtual Conference. • Common Criteria: guarantee the continuity of evaluations during the pandemic   Our experts took part in the CCUF virtual workshop, explaining the measures our cybersecurity laboratory took during the pandemic to guarantee the continuity of the Common Criteria evaluations, at all times in accordance with the requirements of the certification schemes and set out by our clients.Webinar participation in the field of safety and the environment in statutory vehicle inspections In 2020, the International Motor Vehicle Inspection Committee (CITA) organised webinars for its different stakeholders to outline the regulatory framework that seeks to improve road safety and environmental protection.   Personnel from Applus+ actively participated to share their knowledge, such as the talk on “Status of implementation of EU regulation 2019/621” held in October 2020 for 90 participants. Our experts from the Automotive Division shared details on the application of the regulation, within the regulatory framework for their respective regions. In November, the webinar entitled “Collecting OBFCM Data in PTI (Periodic Technical Inspection)” was also held with the participation of our experts, who presented the use of the fuel-measurement devices governed by EU regulation 2018/1832.   The contribution of statutory vehicle inspections to collecting OBFCM (On-Board Fuel Consumption Meter), through the port of on-board devices on vehicles, may help reduce pollutants, improve safety and combat climate change.OUR SUPPLIERSGRI 102-9GRI 204-1GRI 308-1GRI 414-1Approach to purchasing managementOur Corporate Purchasing Department is responsible for the Group’s purchasing policies for services and products, and the department leads throughout the entire purchasing process, covering:• The definition of policies aimed at our suppliers, concisely aligned with the objectives defined by Applus+ for our purchasing activity. • The optimisation of communication mechanisms with our suppliers to reach the best price-quality ratio. • The simplification of processes, with the ensuing improvement of service levels. • Risk reduction and the development of successful relationships. The Purchasing Department ensures an optimal implementation of our policies in all of the countries where we operate, supervising the performance of the teams responsible for the policies’ compliance at a divisional, regional and local level. Impartiality and independence, responsibility, integrity and transparency are key aspects of our purchasing process, as well as a commitment with the supplier to fulfil our social and environmental requirements. All of the Applus+ Group’s suppliers are submitted to an objective assessment process before working with the company, which includes the assurance to fulfil all of the fiscal, environmental, workplace and human rights regulations; the review of the anti-corruption procedures; the data-protection practices and the current legislation on personal protective equipment (PPE) for each country.As defined in our purchasing management standards, our suppliers’ offers are assessed following objective criteria, such as price, quality, delivery time, communication and collaboration, service levels, domestic and international geographical coverage, financial responsibility, technical and productive capacity, and synergies within the Group.Once approved, suppliers must comply with the Group’s commitments relating to our Code of Ethics and the Group’s policies for Anti-Corruption, Environment and Health and Safety.Noteworthy highlights in 2020In 2020, we reviewed and updated two of the main policies led by the Corporate Purchasing Department: the Purchasing policy and the Group Suppliers’ policy. The first determines the criteria for Applus+ and the delegation of authority for all of the purchasing activities, and the second sets out the qualification requirements, as well as the guidelines for managing suppliers, giving more weight to the other criteria based on ethics and environmental actions. Within our selection and qualification criteria, Applus+ also ensures that all of our suppliers have the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining and that suppliers comply with the United Nations’ regulations on fair trade, including the signing of a charter that expressly indicates an adherence to norms such as banning child or forced labour. We have not detected any non-compliance with these rights by our suppliers.We have continued with our policy based on the preferential use of local suppliers insofar as is possible. Similarly, within the qualification process of suppliers, we have started to request information with the purpose of fostering the diversifying of suppliers, such as companies owned by women, people with different capabilities or minorities, especially in certain countries like the USA.2020 was severely affected by the health crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Due to the closures of several countries and the reduction of operations at Applus+, the Purchasing Department had to renegotiate many contracts to align our operations with the new situation. We also experienced a shortage of material and delays due to the global situation, and we had to adapt our personal protective equipment (PPE) to provide a safe environment, both for our employees and clients.In 2020, the total expenditure with suppliers was 539 million euros, and the total number of worldwide suppliers used by Applus+ was 61,325.The 100% of new supplier-type that we consider as strategic, as well as our regular suppliers, are approved using environmental and social criteria. The scope of these figures is limited to the countries covered by the SAP application software (41%).The percentage of products and services acquired locally (at a country level) was 95% in 2020.Follow-up of purchasing policiesOur purchasing policies are applied in all countries and are monitored from the Corporate Purchasing Department under the Suppliers Relationship Officer function. Monitoring is completed with the Qsens application, which can ascertain the policies’ proper implementation and observe qualification-attainment ratios for suppliers. In 2020, we detected no incidence in supplier management. Moreover, during the year we developed a supplier management system by using a new tool which provides us with more information and consequently a greater level of control. This will be implemented in 2021.GRI 103-2GRI 103-3SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     GRI 102-45MANAGEMENT REPORTGRI 102-45Full year report 2020Overview of performanceThe financial performance of the Group is presented in an “adjusted” format alongside the statutory (“reported”) results.

RevenueRevenue for 2020 of €1,557.6 million was lower by 12.4% compared to the previous year. The revenue bridge for the year in € million is shown below and the change in the percentage figures for the last quarter of 2020 are shown below in the waterfall chart. (12.4)%The total revenue decrease of 12.4% for the year was made up of a decrease in organic revenue at constant exchange rates of 11.8%, the addition of revenue from acquisitions (Inorganic) of 1.6% and an unfavourable currency translation impact of 2.2%. In the final quarter of the year, the total revenue was €410.2 million. This was a decrease of 8.5% from the prior year´s final quarter revenue of €448.1 million. This was made up of an organic revenue decrease of 7.9%, a negative currency impact of 4.6% with a 4.0% increase in revenue from acquisitions. The organic revenue decrease in the final quarter was slightly less than in the previous two quarters, showing the gradual recovery of the business.All four divisions of the Group had a decrease in organic revenue in the year, with only the Laboratories Division reporting flat total revenue in 2020 compared to 2019 due to the organic revenue decrease being the same as the additional revenue from the acquisitions made, less the currency impact. The revenue increase of 1.6% from acquisitions relates to a partial year of revenue from three acquisitions made in 2019 until they had been owned for twelve months, plus revenue from five of the six acquisitions signed for in 2020 from the date of acquisition to the end of the year. The sixth acquisition signed in 2020 had not closed by the end of the year.    The largest acquisition was of Besikta, a statutory vehicle inspection business in Sweden that closed during November and currently generates approximately €62 million of annual revenue.Of the revenue in 2020, forty-seven percent was generated in the reporting currency of the Group, which is the euro, and 53% in other currencies, of which the US dollar and other currencies linked to the US dollar are the largest at 24%. The exchange rates changed materially during the year with the US dollar rate used for the translation of the profit and loss in the first half being 2.5% stronger against the Euro and the second half was 5.9% weaker. A similar trend was seen with the Canadian dollar. This resulted in the average exchange rate of the US dollar to the euro for the full year of 2020 compared to 2019 weakening by 1.8% with some other key currencies weakening even more against the euro, and this resulted in an unfavourable foreign exchange impact on the revenue and adjusted operating profit for the year and in the final quarter. Adjusted Operating ProfitAdjusted operating profit for 2020 of €118.4 million was lower by 39.9% compared to the previous year. The adjusted operating profit bridge for the year in € million is shown below and the change in the percentage figures for the last quarter of 2020 are shown below in the waterfall chart. (39.9)%11.1%7.6%% AOP Margin The total adjusted operating profit decrease of 39.9% for the year was made up of a decrease in organic adjusted operating profit at constant exchange rates of 38.7%, acquisitions (Inorganic) of 1.4% and an unfavourable currency translation impact of 2.6%.In the final quarter of the year, the total adjusted operating profit was €43.0 million, a decrease of 11.6% from the prior year final quarter of €48.6 million. This was made up of a decrease in the organic component of 7.2%, a significant negative foreign currency impact of 6.9%, with the addition of 2.5% from acquisitions. The adjusted operating profit decrease in the period came from all four divisions due to the significant fall in revenue, especially in the first half of the year. With tight cost control and the benefit of the various Government cost protection measures, the fall in profit from the significant reduction in revenue was mitigated so that each division reported positive adjusted operating profit for the period with the second half profit being considerably higher than the first half at more than twice as much on both an organic and total reported basis.  The resulting adjusted operating profit margin for the year was 7.6%, significantly lower than the margin of 11.1% in the prior year. The second half margin was nevertheless in double digits at 10.3%, being 70 basis points lower than the second half margin in 2019, which was 11.0%.Other Financial IndicatorsThe reported operating loss was €117.4 million in the year compared to a reported operating profit of €130.8 million in the previous period. The main reason for the extent of the loss was due to the non-cash impairment charge of €165 million taken in the first half year period. See below for a further description of the one-off impairment charge. The net financial expense in the profit and loss for the period was €24.8 million, €0.9 million higher than the previous period expense of €23.9 million, mainly due to the cost of the increase in bank facilities taken out to increase the liquidity and the fees for securing higher leverage covenant levels for the December 2020 and June 2021 tests.The profit before tax on an adjusted basis was €93.6 million compared to €173.2 million in 2019 and on a statutory basis was a loss of €142.3 million compared to a profit of €106.9 million in 2019. The adjusted profit before tax was significantly lower than for the corresponding period last year, due mainly to the lower adjusted operating profit. The statutory loss before tax was additionally significantly lower due to the impairment charge.     The effective tax charge for the year was €29.4 million, which was lower than the prior year of €43.7 million. This gave an effective tax rate of 31.4% being higher than the rate in the prior period of 25.3%. This increase is due to some operations having losses in the year which is not normally the case and where no deferred tax assets have been recognised against these losses. On a statutory basis, the reported tax was a credit of €1.2 million compared to a charge of €30.4 million in the prior year. The tax credit in the profit and loss account was due to a release of the deferred tax liabilities of €16.7 million related to the one-off impairment. Non-controlling interests decreased from €20.9 million in 2019 to €17.2 million in 2020. The decrease of €3.7 million or almost 18% in the period is mainly due to the lower profit from the minority interests, especially within the IDIADA and Energy & Industry (Middle East) Divisions.The adjusted net profit was €47.0 million (2019: €108.6m), and the adjusted earnings per share was 0.33 euros (or 33 cents) (2019: 0.76 euros) for the year. The statutory or reported net position was a net loss of €158.2 million due to the non-cash impairment charge of €165.0 million, as well as the regular non-cash intangible asset amortisation of €58.4 million and €12.4 million of other results, less the reduction in the deferred tax thereon.Cash Flow and DebtThe business generated exceptionally strong cash flow in 2020 mainly due to the decrease in the level of working capital by €86.1 million from the year-end position compared to the flat movement in working capital in the prior year. Additionally, capex and taxes outflows were considerably lower than last year.The decrease in working capital was due to the lower revenue in the year, better debt collection of receivables and due to a step up in capital expenditure in the final quarter where payment is made after the year-end.This significant working capital inflow more than compensated for the reduction in Adjusted EBITDA of €78.1 million from €296.5 million last year to €218.4 million in 2020.Net capital expenditure on expansion of existing and into new facilities was lower than the prior year at €50.2 million (2019: €57.6m) due to the lower activity requiring investments despite investments made for the renewed Automotive contracts in Ireland and Aragon. This capex expenditure represented 3.2% (2019: 3.2%) of Group revenue, the same level as last year.Adjusted operating cash flow (after capital expenditure) was €254.2 million, being €15.2 million or 6.4% higher than for the prior year period last year and this corresponded to a cash conversion rate of 116.4% (2019: 80.6%).The decrease in taxes paid of €24.6 million from €41.3 million paid in 2019 to €16.7 million paid in 2020 was due to the lower amount of advance payments of corporation tax due to expected lower profits, some tax refunds received in the first half of the year, and some permitted tax payment delays as part of the COVID-19 Government assistance schemes.FY20202019CHANGEAdjusted EBITDA218.4296.5(78.1)	(26.3)%Adjusted Operating Cash Flow254.2 116.4%239.080.6%15.26.4%Cash Conversion rateTaxes paidInterest paidAdjusted Free Cash Flow226.2187.438.720.7%Extraordinaries & OthersApplus+ DividendDividends to minoritiesOperating Cash Generated212.4137.275.254.8%AcquisitionsCash b/changes in Financing & FX(4.4)101.5Payments of lease liabilities (IFRS 16)(53.0)(55.6)Other changes in financingTreasury sharesCurrency translationsCash IncreaseChange in working capitalCAPEXThe figures shown in the table above are rounded to the nearest €0.1 million. Adjusted Free Cash Flow was €226.2 million, being €38.7 million or 20.7% higher than for the previous year. There was a decrease in the dividend distributions made in the period. The dividend payout declared for the 2019 full year profits to the Applus+ Group shareholders that was originally proposed to be paid in July was cancelled in April due to the uncertainty surrounding the financial impact arising from the outbreak of COVID-19. The dividends paid to Minority share interests were reduced due to lower profits in those subsidiaries. The cash outflow for acquisitions of €220.1 million relates to five that were closed in the period plus deferred consideration on acquisitions made in prior periods. A sixth acquisition, SAFCO for €25 million, was signed and agreed during the year but had not closed by the end of the year.The final net cash increase in the period was €44.3 million. This was from the cash outflow after acquisitions and before financing and foreign exchange of €4.4 million, less the payment or lease liabilities of €53.0 million that previous to the new accounting standard of IFRS 16 used to be included within operating costs, a net increase in the drawdown of borrowings of €113.7 million, outflows relating to the purchase of treasury shares for management incentive plans of €0.8 million and currency differences of €7.7 million. Net Debt was €741.4 million at the end of the year, which was €97.7 million higher than the Net Debt position at the end of 2019 despite incurring €220.1 million in acquisitions and an increase of €27.6 million in lease liabilities, required to be accounted for under the new accounting standard of IFRS 16, from €169.7 million at the start of the year to €197.3 million at the end of the year. The increase in the lease liabilities was due to new leases taken on with acquisitions and the renewals of leases, especially following the renewal of the Automotive contract in Ireland, that lengthened their average maturity and hence liability. The robust performance in the Net Debt was due to the exceptionally strong free cash flow generated by the business. The Net Debt waterfall chart is shown top right.DEC 2019DEC 2020	Debt	cash flow	lease liabilities	variation	Debt2.2x3.1x2.0x3.0xExcluding IFRS 16NET DEBT/EBITDAIncluding IFRS 16NET DEBT/EBITDAThe resulting financial leverage of the Group measured as Net Debt to last twelve months Adjusted EBITDA was 3.0x (as defined by the bank covenant for the syndicated debt facilities and the US Private Placement notes), which was higher than at the end of the previous year (2.0x) due mainly to the lower EBITDA in the year that included the second quarter period when the business was the most severely affected by the pandemic. The covenant from the lenders is set at 4.0x to be tested twice a year at the end of June and the end of December, except for December 2020 and June 2021 for which the covenant has been relaxed to a higher level by the lenders which permitted the Company to continue with its acquisition strategy with a comfortable level of covenant headroom.The financial leverage calculation using the covenant definitions except for using current accounting standards, including IFRS 16, is also shown in the table, and at 31st December 2020 was 3.1x compared to 2.2x at 31st December 2019.At the end of the year, the available liquidity position was over €550 million that is made up mostly of cash and long dated undrawn loan commitments.DividendIn recognition of the strong cash flow, comfortable financial leverage, liquidity position and favourable future earnings and cash flow potential, the Board will propose to shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, on the 28th May 2021, a dividend of 15 cents per share. This is the same amount as was last declared on the 2018 earnings and paid in 2019 and is equivalent to €21.5 million, (2019: Nil and 2018: €21.5 million) and is 45.6% (2019: Nil and 2018: 22.1%) of the adjusted net income of €47.0 million as shown in the summary financial results table. If approved at the Annual General Meeting, the dividend will be paid to shareholders on the 8th July 2021. As previously notified, the Board in April 2020 reluctantly withdrew the recommendation for a dividend to be paid in July 2020 on the 2019 results, consistent with the prudent actions taken due to the rapidly evolving and deteriorating situation at the time, and so the Board are pleased to be able to resume recommending a dividend in these less uncertain times. The Board will continue to review the appropriate level of dividend going forward with the aim of annually increasing the payment. Impairment reviewEvery year, the Company carries out an impairment review of the cash generating units. The goodwill and the non-current assets were mostly booked in 2008 when the Company was bought by a private equity firm from the previous owners. In H1 2020, the Group recognised an impairment of €165.0 million, relating to the Energy & Industry business in North America, North Europe and the Middle East and the IDIADA Division. The impairment was driven by the challenging Oil and Gas and Automotive industry end-market situation and the unprecedented degree of forecast uncertainty relating to COVID-19.The review at 30th June 2020 included using lower future growth rates over the next five years for some business lines that make up cash generating units, including for Oil and Gas. There is a release of €16.7 million of deferred tax liability directly allocated to these impaired assets, resulting in a net impairment amount of €148.3 million allocated as follows:EUR MillionEnergy & Industry137.1IDIADA27.9Gross Impairment165.0Deferred tax liability release(16.7)Net Impairment148.3The impairment and associated net tax effects are all non-cash items.COVID-19 updateThe response by the Company to the COVID-19 outbreak has been wide-ranging with due consideration for the social and human consequences and for the long-term benefit of the company. It has been to prioritise the wellbeing of our people and their families, including to reduce the risk of people catching or spreading the coronavirus, protecting jobs as far as possible, supporting customers meet their operational challenges, where in many cases the services provided by the people of Applus+ continue to be essential. Tight cost control, prioritisation of the management of cash inflows and outflows, and the prudent management of financial resources and financial risk continue to be applied, whilst being open to business opportunities including those that require investment to ensure the future growth in value of the business.The company has also been careful to ensure the shareholders and financial markets have been kept informed of developments throughout the year and especially with regards to operational and financial performance and liquidity and balance sheet strength.Applus+ is a prudently managed business and entered the crisis with a strong balance sheet, long debt maturities and a high level of liquidity. The company nevertheless continues to remain vigilant and will continue to take all the precautionary measures at its disposal to protect itself and its stakeholders and emerge from this crisis with the capacity and strength to return to its proven growth strategy that has been successful.OutlookWhilst there remains considerable uncertainty in every country and in the end markets, guidance is provided by the company assuming that the conditions today either remain the same or do not deteriorate. In 2021, it is expected that total revenue will grow by at least double digits at constant exchange rates from both organic and acquisitions already made and for the margin to improve to close to 10%. Furthermore, the inorganic growth strategy will continue to followed supported by the lliquidity and leverage headroom. Operating review by divisionThe Group operates through four global business divisions: Energy & Industry Division, Automotive Division, IDIADA Division and Laboratories Division, and the respective shares of 2020 revenue and adjusted operating profit are shown above.FY 2020 revenue split Energy & IndustryFY 2020 adjusted operating profit splitLaboratories7%Energy & IndustryThe Energy & Industry Division is a world leader in non-destructive testing, industrial and environmental inspection, quality assurance and quality control, engineering and consultancy, vendor surveillance, certification and asset-integrity services.The Division designs and deploys proprietary technology and industry know-how across diverse sectors, helping our clients to develop and control industry processes, protect assets and increase operational and environmental safety. The services are provided for a wide range of industries including oil and gas, power, construction, mining, aerospace and telecommunications.Revenue for Energy & Industry for the year was €907.3 million, which was 14.3% lower than the revenue in 2019, and the Adjusted Operating Profit for the year was €41.4 million, which was 53.5% lower than in 2019 resulting in an adjusted operating profit margin of 4.6%. These results in € million and the percentage changes from 2019 are broken down into organic, inorganic and foreign exchange and are shown in the following table. 20202019ChangeOrganicInorganicFXRevenue907. 31,059.3(14.3)%(12.4)%0.6%(2.5)%Adj.

There was additional revenue of 0.6% related to a part year contribution from the acquisition of LEM in Chile made in 2019. Currency translation decreased reported revenue by 2.5% mainly because of the weaker US dollar and Latin American currencies against the Euro. At constant exchange rates, organic adjusted operating profit decreased by 52.6%, being significantly more than the organic revenue decrease. There was the same contribution from the acquisition of 0.6% and a negative currency impact of 1.6%. The adjusted operating profit margin decreased by 380 basis points from 8.4% for 2019 to 4.6% in 2020, with this decrease coming from the organic revenue decline. Costs were reduced through the use of the Government temporary lay-off programmes and restructuring of the business to reduce the permanent cost base going forward. In the final quarter of the year, reported revenue was €220.4 million compared to revenue of €269.8 million in the final quarter of 2019 or 18.3% lower. This was mainly due to a decrease in organic revenue of 13.7%, the revenue from the acquisition added 0.2% and a negative impact from currency translation of 4.8%.Following the significant decrease in revenue in the second quarter of 2020, there was a gradual recovery in the second half with third quarter and fourth quarter organic revenue decrease remaining approximately similar at 12.8% and 13.7% respectively. The COVID-19 impact continued to directly affect revenue due to projects being cancelled or delayed into 2021 with this being exacerbated by the lower demand for oil and the low price, especially in the first half impacting the customers in the oil and gas end-market to reduce spending with their suppliers. All regions were heavily impacted and reported lower revenue than in 2019 with the Mediterranean, Northern Europe and Latin American regions showing a recovery in the final quarter of the year.The business that services the end-markets of Power, Construction, Aerospace and Telecommunications and account for 44% of the Division’s revenue in 2020 have grown solidly over the previous few years but was down by 9% in 2020 due to the lockdowns and project delays.It is expected that this part of the business will have strong growth going forward led by geographic expansion and the energy transition where electricity generation and distribution is expected to continue to migrate from fossil fuels to renewables, where Applus+ is well positioned to serve through the Energy & Industry division within the Power business line. The business that services the Oil and Gas endmarket for operational expenditure for maintenance and inspection work (Opex) accounts for 43% of the Division by revenue in 2020 and has been resilient over the years. This business was also severely impacted by lockdowns and project delays, resulting in a 15% decrease in revenue in 2020. Nevertheless, there are good prospects for this business based on the extensive infrastructure and assets that continue to be used for production and delivery of oil and gas and as these get older and regulations become tighter, the inspection requirement will increase.The business that services the Oil and Gas endmarket for new investments and new build (Capex) accounts for 13% of the division by revenue in 2020 and has been heavily impacted since 2015 due to the significant decrease in capex investment by the industry. This business is the most sensitive to the oil price and the energy transition to lower carbon emissions. The revenue in this part fell by 26% in 2020. At the Group revenue level, this exposure has fallen from 9% in 2019 to 7% in 2020 and in 2014 was 24%.In December of 2020, the Group signed an agreement to purchase SAFCO, which is a leading construction testing and inspection services company based in Saudi Arabia, for an initial consideration of USD 30 million (c. €25 million) and that currently generates approximately USD 35 million (c. €29 million) of annual revenue at margins significantly higher than the Applus+ Group. The closing of the acquisition is expected to take place in March 2021. AutomotiveThe Automotive Division delivers statutoryvehicle-inspection services globally. The Division’s programmes inspect vehicles in jurisdictions where transport and systems must comply with statutory technical-safety and environmental regulations.The Division operates 30-plus programmes, carrying out over 20 million vehicle inspections across Spain, Ireland, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Andorra, the United States, Argentina, Georgia, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador and Uruguay in 2020. In the programmemanaged services, a further 6 million inspections were delivered by third parties.Revenue for Automotive for the year was €355.8 million, which was 7.7% lower than the revenue in 2019, and the Adjusted Operating Profit for the year was €82.5 million, which was 10.3% lower than in 2019 resulting in an adjusted operating profit margin of 23.2%. These results in € million and the percentage changes from 2019 are broken down into organic, inorganic and foreign exchange and are shown in the following table.20202019ChangeOrganicInorganicFXRevenue355.8385.4(7.7)%(8.6)%3.4%(2.5)%Adj.

There was additional revenue of 3.4% related to a part year contribution from the acquisitions of ITV Canarias made in the first quarter of the year and Besikta in Sweden made in the final quarter. Currency translation decreased reported revenue by 2.5% mainly because of the weaker South American currencies and US dollar against the Euro. At constant exchange rates, organic adjusted operating profit decreased by 9.6%, being slightly more than the organic revenue decrease. There was a contribution from the acquisitions of 1.2% and a negative currency impact of 1.9%. The adjusted operating profit margin decreased by 70 basis points from 23.9% for 2019 to 23.2% in 2020, with this decrease coming from both the organic revenue decline and the lower margin businesses within the acquisitions. Costs were managed through the use of the governmental temporary lay-off programmes.In the final quarter of the year, reported revenue was €107.9 million compared to revenue of €89.8 million in the final quarter of 2019 or 20.1% higher. This was mainly due to an increase in organic revenue of 14.8%, the revenue from the acquisition added 12.3% and a negative impact from currency translation of 7.0%.Following the significant impact the Division experienced in the first half of the year and in particular in April when most of the stations were closed, there was a strong recovery in the second half for revenue and profit, with the second half margin of 26.8% being similar to the first half margin in prior years due to the normal seasonality with the higher volume of the business usually being in the first half but in 2020 was in the second half. All contracts in 2020 recovered similar to prior year levels of revenue, except for Ireland, Argentina and Chile where either there was a permanent shift forward of the vehicle inspection dates or the stations were closed for a prolonged period of time. The contract held in the autonomous region of Aragon in Spain that generates approximately €5 million per annum was extended for a further 10 years on the same terms and conditions as the previous contract, with some up-front investment required to increase capacity for this renewed period. Four other small contracts in the US were also extended by between one and five years, with a total revenue of another €5 million per annum.Three new vehicle inspection contracts were recently awarded in Mexico that will generate approximately €2 million of additional revenue per annum once they start in 2022. This award is a first entry into Mexico for Applus+ and will open further opportunities of expansion in the country.In the first quarter of the year, a vehicle inspection business was bought in Spain, ITV Canarias, which has three wholly owned stations plus one 50% owned station in the Canary Islands, all operating under the liberalised regime and generates €4 million of revenue at a high margin with good opportunities for marketing and cost synergies. In the final quarter of the year, the Group purchased one of the leading statutory vehicle inspection companies in Sweden called Besikta Bilprovning for €101 million. Besikta´s current revenue is €62 million per annum and is highly recurring and growing as are its cash flows and has an EBITDA margin in the high teens before applying IFRS 16. It performs 1.5 million inspections per annum being approximately 25% of the total market in Sweden. Integrating Besikta into the Applus+ Automotive division will bring mutual benefits from the opportunity to share best practice and consumer marketing expertise. Following this acquisition, Applus+ has become the leading operator in the Nordic region building upon its strong presence in the liberalised markets of Denmark and Finland and this has improved the portfolio quality of the Automotive division by reducing the dependence of the division on concessions that require periodic renewals.There is a pipeline of further opportunities for both organic and inorganic expansion which the Group will continue to monitor and review closely.IDIADAIDIADA A.T. (80% owned by Applus+ and 20% by the Government of Catalonia) has been operating under an exclusive contract from the 351-hectare technology centre near Barcelona (owned by the Government of Catalonia) since 1999. The contract to operate the business runs until September 2024 and although it is renewable in five-year periods until 2049, it has been decided that there will be no further extensions but a tender for a new 20 or 25 year concession.IDIADA A.T. provides services to the world’s leading vehicle manufacturers for new product development activities in design, engineering, testing and homologation.Revenue for IDIADA for the year was €201.5 million, which was 16.1% lower than the revenue in 2019 and the Adjusted Operating Profit for the year was €11.5 million which was 62.4% lower than in 2019 resulting in an adjusted operating profit margin of 5.7%. These results in € million and the percentage changes from 2019 are broken down into organic, inorganic and foreign exchange and are shown in the following table.20202019ChangeOrganicFXRevenue201.5240.1(16.1)%(15.2)%(2.5)%Adj. Op. Profit11.530.6(62.4)%(62.3)%(1.9)%% AOP Margin5.7%12.7%Following many years of uninterrupted revenue and adjusted operating profit growth in this division, the revenue and adjusted operating profit reduced significantly in 2020 because of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic resulting in a temporary period of closure of the facilities and a decrease in customers especially at the facilities in Spain. Following the low in the second quarter, the business has recovered, albeit slowly. Organic revenue at constant exchange rates decreased by 15.2% and currency translation decreased reported revenue by 0.9% mainly because of the weaker US dollar, Brazilian real and several other currencies against the Euro. At constant exchange rates, organic adjusted operating profit decreased by 62.3% being significantly more than the organic revenue decrease. The adjusted operating profit margin decreased by 700 basis points from 12.7% for 2019 to 5.7% in 2020. The margin fall was mitigated by reducing costs using the governmental temporary lay-off programmes and permanent restructuring. The adjusted operating profit margin decreased more than the Adjusted EBITDA as a result of the faster depreciation of assets as the term of the current five-year renewed contract with the Government of Catalonia ends in 2024.In the final quarter of the year, reported revenue was €51.4 million compared to revenue of €62.5 million in the final quarter of 2019 or 17.8% lower. This was mainly due to a decrease in organic revenue of 16.5%, and a small negative impact from currency translation of 1.3%.The division continued to be materially affected to the end of the year largely due to the mobility restrictions and the reluctance for customers to travel internationally to visit the facilities in Spain with their cars for testing on the Proving Ground which is the highest margin segment of the division. Nevertheless, the business saw good growth for the testing of Electric and Hybrid vehicles and for ADAS (Advanced Driving Assistance System).The tender for a new 20 or 25-year concession by the Government of Catalonia from September 2024 when the current five year extension ends is still expected to take place and is expected to commence in the first half of this year.LaboratoriesThe Laboratories Division provides testing, certification and engineering services to improve product competitiveness and promote innovation. The Division operates a network of multidisciplinary laboratories in Europe, Asia and North America.With cutting-edge facilities and technical expertise, the Division’s services add high value to a wide range of industries, including aerospace, automotive, electronics, information technology and construction.In 2020, the Laboratories Division acquired three companies, which are discussed below, to add to the two purchased in 2019 and five purchased in the previous two years.Revenue for the Laboratories Division for the year was €92.9 million, which was flat on 2019 and the Adjusted Operating Profit for the year was €9.7 million, which was 27.7% lower than in 2019 resulting in an adjusted operating profit margin of 10.5%. These results in € million and the percentage changes from 2019 are broken down into organic, inorganic and foreign exchange and are shown in the following table.20202019ChangeOrganicInorganicFXRevenue92.993.0(0.0)%(7.9)%8.6%(0.8)%Adj.

Following the trough in revenue in the second quarter of the year. The Division had a gradual recovery in the second half, including delivering a double-digit adjusted operating profit margin.Organic revenue at constant exchange rates decreased by 7.9% for the year. There was additional revenue of 8.6% related to a partyear contribution from the two acquisitions made in the first quarter of last year and a part-year contribution from the three acquisitions made in 2020. Currency translation decreased reported revenue by 0.8% mainly because of the weaker US dollar against the Euro. At constant exchange rates, organic adjusted operating profit decreased by 37.2%, being more than the organic revenue decrease. There was a contribution from the acquisitions of 10.5% and a negative currency impact of 1.0%. The adjusted operating profit margin decreased by 400 basis points from 14.5% for 2019 to 10.5% in 2020 with this decrease coming from the organic revenue decline. As with the other divisions, costs were reduced through the use of the governmental temporary lay-off programmes as well as some permanent restructuring. In the final quarter of the year, reported revenue was €30.5 million compared to revenue of €26.0 million in the final quarter of 2019 or 17.5% higher. This was mainly due to the acquisitions that had been made during the year, adding 23.5% to revenue with organic revenue being down 4.1% and a negative impact from currency translation of 1.9%.In the second half of the year, the Construction and Product Certification businesses led the recovery, while Aerospace, Electrical and Electronics (E&E) and Metrology continued to be the most impacted.There were three acquisitions made in the year. In the first quarter, the Group purchased ZYX which is a small metrology business in Spain with revenue of under €2 million per annum. In the final quarter of the year, two acquisitions were made. Reliable Analysis was purchased which has €24 million of annual revenue and is a laboratory-based materials, component, electrical and EMC testing company with over 300 employees, primarily serving the automotive industry and specifically for electric vehicles (EV) operating from two locations in China and two in the USA. This acquisition significantly increases the Division´s footprint in China and its exposure to the fast growth EV market, especially in China which is the largest EV market in the world. QPS Evaluation Services Inc was purchased in December with €16 million of annual revenue, which is a product certification company for a wide range of industrial, medical and electrical and electronic (E&E) products, including equipment and devices used in hazardous locations (explosive atmospheres). It has 133 employees and an extensive presence in its home market of Canada and the USA, with a presence also in Europe and Asia. In the last four years, the Laboratories Division has made ten acquisitions in total with a combined revenue of €58 million per annum at accretive margins and this has expanded its testing facilities to reinforce its position in the electrical and electronics, automotive components, fire protection, aerospace parts and calibration sectors. This acquisition momentum for this division is expected to continue. The division now comprises six key business units: Electrical & Electronics (includes electrical and electromagnetic compatibility testing and product certification for the electronics and automotive sector); Mechanical (includes aerospace and materials testing); Construction (includes fire and structural testing of building materials); IT (includes electronic payment system protocol testing and approval); Metrology (includes calibration and measuring instruments) and Systems Certification. Electrical & Electronics is now the largest business unit comprising approximately 40% of the division by revenue in 2020 on a proforma basis including the acquisitions made. 
BUSINESS RISKS     GRI 102-15GRI 201-2GRI 207-2The Applus+ Group’s Risk Map covers all the risks that could present a significant impact on the company’s results. The risks included within the map have been identified under four different categories: 1. Strategic risks, including sustainability-related risks and climate change (further details are discussed in the    section Risks related to climate change). 2. Operational risks, which are inherent to the Group’s activities.3. Financial risks, including tax risks. 4. Legal and compliance risks.The Group’s main risks and their management are as follows:• Precise monitoring of the business conducted by the Group which are subject to long-term, finite contracts, such as concessions in the statutory-vehicle-inspection business in Spain, Europe and America, and in the IDIADA Division’s businesses, which provide services to the leading vehicle manufacturers worldwide. • The company implements a diversification strategy to manage certain levels of exposure to Group’s evolving markets, such as the oil and gas and automotive sectors.  • Meticulous tracking of the formal terms and service quality of all the services provided based on accreditations awarded. To reduce such risks, the Group has insurance policies to cover damages that may be caused by third parties in the course of our services offered. • Risks related to the economic, social and political situations in the countries where the Group operates, as well as the main macroeconomic indicators which may have short-term or long-term future impacts on the results of the Applus+ Group, especially considering the Group’s extensive geographic reach. • Our personnel’s qualifications and motivation are crucial to our activities, so we make major efforts to retain key staff and improve talent management. • Exhaustive monitoring of legislative and compliance issues to prevent criminal sanctions or significant business losses arising from non-compliance with the Criminal Risk and Crime Prevention Management System implemented in the Group. • A specific action plan to combat risks related to cybersecurity. To manage financial risks, the Group monitors the main risks that could have an impact on our results: • Management of the Group’s risks connected to liquidity and indebtedness, as well as working-capital management, which are essential for achieving the Group’s strategic goals. • Risk of overestimating the value of certain significant assets (such as stock-in-trade, intangible assets generated from inorganic growth, as well as tax assets).

Risks related to climate changeThe Applus+ Group’s risk-management procedure takes a holistic approach, which includes different types of risks and those related to climate change.To conduct and assess climate-related risks systematically, we use the standard global reference from the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which established the definition and categorisation of the risks associated with climate change in 2017.In accordance with this standard, these risks can be divided into two main categories: physical risks and transitional risks. Physical risks arise from an increase in extreme weather or the long-term impacts of climate change, which are classified into acute or chronic risks, and transition risks of economic agents for an economy based on decarbonisation. Transitional risks are subdivided into legal, technological, market and reputational risks. These risks are identified through surveys with our management team and the persons responsible for different regions to get an accurate, realistic picture of the situation for each business unit and geographic region. Following these assessments, the risks identified are included in our risk matrix under the process described in this report’s section Business Risks. This process is undertaken periodically and once a year minimally.Physical risks1. Acute risks. The risks classified as acute arise from extreme weather events such as cyclones, hurricanes, floods or wildfires. These risks could be significant because the Applus+ Group has facilities all over the world, and every year we experience disruptions due to extreme weather events. Occasionally, these disruptions are because our facilities have been affected, and in other times, the risk arise because our clients’ facilities have been affected. Such disruptions have affected us for brief periods of time, although they have clearly impacted our performance.  In 2020, several examples include Tropical Cyclone Damian in Australia in February, which forced us to stand down our teams on one project; the wildfire in California during their summer months; the typhoons in South Korea in September and November, which closed industry for a number of weeks and caused delays in some projects because the personnel were left house-bound; Hurricane Delta in Mexico in October; and the floods along the east coast of Spain, which caused delays on some projects. 2. Chronic risks. These arise from a change in the climate’s behaviour in the mid- or long-term, especially due to the overall rise in global temperatures, which may generate an increase in energy costs and require new investments in the mid-term. In the long-term, an increase in global temperature could lead to rising sea levels, which would force the company to relocate some facilities.To date, the financial impact on the Group’s operations has been low because the events have been brief and occasional. However, given the geographic spread of our operations, the likelihood of these events happening simultaneously in many different locations is considered low.Transitional risks1. Legal risks. Climate change is an issue which is evolving quickly and requires a determined reaction to the new regulations in each country. In view of these changes, the main risk identified is non-compliance with these new regulations.  • The reporting obligations are increasing in general because, firstly, the legislative changes associated with the reporting of non-financial information; and secondly, from investors exerting greater pressure for information related to our climate-change management. Adapting to these changes requires the company to establish and implement reporting and internal-control tools that ensure compliance with the new requirements.» The risk of non-compliance is considered low for Applus+. The Group monitors legislative changes and has implemented a plan to deploy and expand our informationcollection process gradually. For example, in 2019, in anticipation of future requirements, we included in our reporting-data Scope 3 of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) for energy distribution and employee commuting.  » Nevertheless, the processes we have implemented have provided the management with the opportunity to better manage and establish improvement plans in the short-, medium- and long-term. As a consequence, we have defined a plan with short-, medium- and longterm targets to reduce the Group’s emissions. • At an operational level, the new regulations on sustainable mobility that promote the use of vehicles with lower emissions, which sometimes tax or limit the use of vehicles with higher pollution, can lead to costs for the Group’s vehicle fleet because of the need to either adapt or replace them. » This risk is being managed through a fleet-renewal programme, which has led to a steady decrease in average emissions in recent years. Furthermore, we have added clean vehicles to our purchasing catalogue, and we are internally promoting and increasing the use of eco-vehicles.  • In addition, the energy-efficiency regulations for buildings in the EU legislate for all member states to decarbonise their inventory of existing buildings by 2050. This regulation was due to be ratified by all EU countries in 2020. There is no doubt that this regulation will require investments to adapt to the new requirements; however, at Applus+ this risk is considered low because we own very few buildings.  Notwithstanding these types of risks, the new regulations enable the Group to design and implement new services that assist our clients to comply with the new regulations, therefore reinforcing our presence in fields like emissions testing or standardisation and “clean” vehicle testing, or testing insulation materials and construction products. Test tracks service2. Technological risks. The technological improvements or innovations that are supporting the transition to the low-carbon economy may have a significant impact on our organisation. This may affect different aspects of our internal management and in our services.  The main risk is associated with a lack of flexibility to adapt to these new technologies, which could exclude our services from markets, either because we cannot cover our clients’ new needs or because our ability to react is lower than our competitors. This could lead to a change in our Group’s business and income.  Conversely, the application of new technologies makes remote inspection and real-time monitoring of tests possible, which reduces our employees or clients’ times and lowers service times, plant or asset shutdowns and costs, while increasing the safety of service delivery.  We are constantly innovating together with our clients, which enables our technicians to understand and address their needs. Furthermore, specifically in digitalisation, Applus+ has set up a working group to promote and develop technologies for these new opportunities within the organisation. 3. Market risks. Climate change is unquestionably affecting the market, primarily in the supply and demand of certain products and increased production costs.  The Group’s exposure to the oil and gas sector is considered a risk factor because of the transition to a low-carbon economy. In this regard, the Group’s greatest exposure revolves more for services in operations (77%) than for new facilities (23%). The transition in this area will take place gradually, which provides the company with a period to adapt to this transition. To do so, the Group has implemented a diversification plan to reduce the Group’s level of exposure, which has enabled us to advance from almost 50% in 2014 to 32% in 2020, lowering the company’s dependence on this sector in recent years. Furthermore, the current mix of services the company provides in this area is primarily based on services in operating expenses (OPEX), while only 7% of these services are provided for new facilities (CAPEX).   More assuredly, the market’s shift towards promoting and using renewable energies is also providing new opportunities for growth in these sectors. We have developed a plan to increase the Group’s presence in regions where our presence in this sector has historically been more limited.   The automotive sector is also an area which could be affected by this transition process, with the greatest risk in the mid- to long-term as emission inspections in vehicles become less necessary with fewer internalcombustion engines on the road. This would affect the USA market which accounts for approximately 2% of the Group revenue, although in other countries these inspections are marginal. In addition, the introduction of increasingly connected and electric vehicles will require different homologation, testing and inspections, in which factors like their functionality and safety are more important than the current ones. 4. Reputational risks. Depending on how the company manages our contribution to the transition to a more sustainable economy, the effects on our company’s image and prestige may present significant risks as well as strong opportunities.  The main risk is the loss of trust among our investors and stakeholders in the Group’s management approach to the issues related to climate change. However, this risk can also be transferred to our clients because, by being part of their supply chain, we can contribute to improvements in their management.  In this respect, we have established a plan with measurable and assessable objectives to show our commitment and progress transparently.   Even though the Group’s operations do not contribute greatly to emissions or other environmental impacts, we responsibly manage the impacts we have by planning and implementing energy-reduction and efficiency measures. Even though we perceive some risks, we believe that we are effectively managing these risk, so we should not have major impacts. Furthermore, we are identifying clear opportunities due to climate change, which we are developing and fostering, and as a whole, the company can offset the potential impacts identified, even if the impacts are minimal.• Impact of the risks: The results of the assessment-analysis showed that the risks identified are being managed to ensure that the risks are not relevant to the Group’s activities in the majority of our regions and businesses. • Management approach: We are implementing plans to reduce and mitigate any negative consequence associated with these risks. • Opportunities: Our assessment shows that a number of issues related to climate change are actually opportunities for the Applus+ Group. The positive part of climate-change mitigation is greater than the costs to the Group of managing the impacts.Energy efficiency servicesResponse to the coronavirus pandemicIn 2020, we had to confront the health crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic, which posed a major challenge globally, both as a health crisis and a socio-economic crisis. The Applus+ Group has implemented specific actions to protect our employees’ health, adapt our activities and services, support society to our best ability, and guarantee the company’s sustainability in the mid- to long-term. Our response to this global challenge has been robust and emphatic, implementing measures that inspire trust in all of our stakeholders through our efforts to work towards the near future dependably and optimistically for when the pandemic is behind us. • From the outset, to prevent and control the risk of infection in the settings where we delivery our activities and to protect our employees’ health, we immediately established corporate guidelines and safety protocols across our global operations. These guidelines and protocols covered all the key safeguarding aspects: the use of personal protective equipment (PPE); hygiene and cleaning processes; social-distancing and travel restrictions; reduced occupancy at our offices by encouraging home-working; and establishing the minimum safety requirements at our facilities, while assuring the constant availability of PPE for all our employees. • We have worked to guarantee our capacity to provide services, help manage the risks and assist our clients to resume operations. To do this, we have adapted our services and created specific services to continue meeting our clients’ needs during the crisis, thanks to our steadfast commitment to innovation. Our efforts in the area of digitalisation, which were started some years ago, intensified this year, and these have enabled us to develop digital and remote tools, such e-testing to track industrial-testing programmes remotely in real time; methodologies to conduct remote inspections using augmented-reality systems and other digital features; and remote visual inspections (RVIS) on hard-to-reach or dangerous inspections. These advances allow our teams to delivery activities with the maximum safety for clients and employees alike, while maintaining excellent service quality.  • To minimise the impact of the pandemic on the company’s margins, the Group has adopted strict cost controls, and in some of our businesses and regions, we have benefited from the protection measures offered by the governments in a number of countries. • Liquidity management was the Group’s principle concern, and the company’s executive management reacted quickly to maintain the company’s strong financial position. The first measures consisted of cancelling the dividend payment in 2019, increasing the financing lines, and temporarily lowering the remuneration paid to the Board of Directors and the Group’s senior management. In parallel, the Group lowered the planned investments budgeted for 2020 to adapt to the new economic situation, and we proficiently managed the accounts payable from clients. As a result of these measures, we maintained a strong liquidity position that, along with the outstanding cash generated, enabled the Group to make important acquisitions. • We have issued guidelines for remote working, while providing the IT infrastructure needed to facilitate and ensure secure home-working, and to strengthen our employees’ training in cybersecurity.  • Different initiatives for social action have enabled the Group to help the people who experienced hardship resulting from the pandemic in local communities all over the world. This included certifying ventilators in Spain at the beginning of the pandemic; lending our facilities to conduct COVID-19 diagnostic tests in the United States; providing protective gear in the United Kingdom, Spain and the Netherlands; and supplying food and basic products to those in most need.The Board of Directors held many sessions throughout the year to track exhaustively the impact of the crisis on the Group and to ensure that the measures implemented were effective and sufficient.EMC TestingGRI 103-2GRI 103-3OUR EMPLOYEESGRI 102-8GRI 102-12GRI 102-41GRI 401-2GRI 402-1GRI 403-1GRI 403-2GRI 403-3GRI 403-4GRI 403-5GRI 403-6GRI 403-7GRI 405-1GRI 411-1Human resources policies In 2020, the Applus+ Group maintained our existing policies and did not introduce any new ones, so we could instead focus on supporting employees and operations in view of the challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic. Employee-relations practices  In 2020, the Group has continued our long-standing practices for good employee relations, which have proven effective during the pandemic.In all the countries where Applus+ offers services and conducts activities, the Group seeks to reach agreements on working conditions for employees and adapt these agreements by considering our employees’ needs, respecting and protecting their fundamental rights to freedom of association and trade union membership. The Group’s policy is upheld and supported by the regulations approved locally, our corporate policies and procedures, and the guidelines in the Applus+ Group’s Code of Ethics.At Applus+, we respect our employees’ right to collective bargaining, and we work with our employees’ freely-elected representatives according to the employment laws in force in each country in an effort to promote freedom of association. Correspondingly, we encourage a culture of dialogue and negotiation with our employees’ representatives and stakeholders by promoting and maintaining the use of ongoing communication channels which play an active role in our policies.We have mechanisms by which employees can obtain information and ask questions, while complying with the employment laws in force in each country where we operate. Any worker may submit questions or suspicions of non-compliance through the Ethics and Compliance Communication Channel at Applus+. We respect minimal notice periods by warning employees before applying significant operational changes, in accordance with local employment practices and markets.Organisation of workTo keep our employees informed and up to date with the latest news, Applus+ produces and provides our employees with corporate and local handbooks, which contain information related to the company and the general, applicable working conditions (annual work hours, breaks, paid leave, etc.). These handbooks fulfil the laws in force in each country, as well as any applicable collective-bargaining agreements and corporate policies and procedures.In addition to having these rules at work, we try to adapt our employees’ work to their personal needs whenever possible. At the Applus+ Group, we are committed to our employees’ work-life balance. This is why we implement flexibility strategies which enable our people to balance their personal, family and professional lives, as shown by the results and acknowledgements we have received in this area cited below. • We facilitate our employees’ geographic and functional mobility. This ensures that we have highly motivated employees who are engaged in developing their potential and work with commitment and effort to achieve the company’s success. • Furthermore, we adapt the working conditions for employees with different abilities, women carrying children, nursing parents or individuals with other special conditions or requirements, as stipulated in the laws currently in force, collective-bargaining agreements or applicable programmes of best practices.And finally, we can report absenteeism was 2.1% of hours worked, out of the Group’s total headcount in 2020. Employee remuneration policies The Applus+ remuneration policy is based on the criteria of objectivity, external competitiveness and internal equality. The procedure establishing the organisation’s remuneration system is always adapted to the legal regulations in force in each of the countries where the Group operates. Furthermore, the process also includes the participation of and consultations with employee representatives in locations where legal provisions or cultural practices require. Equal pay between women and men within the company is a commitment by Applus+ for which we strive to promote and guarantee. The commitments to equality and anti-discrimination by Applus+ are represented in our Code of Ethics and Global Anti-Discrimination Policy. Employees’ rights and benefits We have an array of programmes for social and economic benefits to foster our employees’ wellbeing. Our initiatives always try to adapt to the particular conditions, needs and resources of our people, which vary according to the features of each location.Correspondingly, the Group also complies with the right to disconnect from work, in accordance with the provisions included in the applicable collective-bargaining agreements and the local regulations established in this area.Employment and human capital managementThe Applus+ strategy for managing human capital is based on four main cornerstones. In 2020, we continued to implement them by offering a broad range of programmes and projects to foster professional development and equal opportunities.
Talent managementAt Applus+, we make people and talent a priority in our management.In 2020, we concluded the second edition of the Group’s Global Management Development Programme (GMDP) for the second intake of 29 managers from 13 countries across the divisions at Applus+. For seven months, the participants shared ideas and experiences in areas such as business strategy, business management, leadership and communication. The programme is designed exclusively for Applus+ in collaboration with one of the most renowned international business schools - the IE Business School (Madrid). The programme combines training by our Management Team and academic lectures provided by the business school’s professors. The programme’s content focuses on supporting the development and growth of our people’s capabilities and management skills, while ensuring the future success and sustainability of the Group.Employee engagementBased on the results of the most recent Global Satisfaction Survey, we have defined action plans in 34 countries, with 645 measures addressing the different dimensions from within the survey model.Throughout 2020, all 645 measures were implemented within the established timeframe, which finalised all of the action plans designed by each division of the Group.Diversity, inclusion and equal opportunitiesEveryone who is part of the Applus+ Group is unique, and we want them to contribute the best of their capabilities. We are committed to building a diverse and inclusive society and attracting talent that helps the company compete in a global context.  We prioritise the elimination of prejudices and unconscious biases, and we promote socio-labour inclusion and professional promotion of all social groups, particularly those with greater difficulties in accessing the employment market. This is why in 2020 we continued to advocate for:• Diversity of belief, culture, ethnicity, and people with different abilities. We are present in over 70 countries on all five continents, with 88% of our personnel employed locally. Internal promotion favours local workforces, which means most of our managers are from their countries of origin.  We continue to collaborate with South Africa’s government initiative for Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment to redress the social and economic inequalities of the former apartheid system. Applus+ has a Level 4 on the BBBE-E certification. • Diversity in gender by incorporating women in the design and advancement of plans and in the Global Executive Development programmes.  We continue to work on the Councils established for diversity and equality. The Councils, set up in 2019, are forums to express interests, concerns, needs and barriers affecting diversity and equality to develop action plans and proposals for improvements.In addition, Applus+ was selected as one of the top-ten companies, among the 393 companies submitted to the 2020 Alares Awards, for our work-life balance practices in Spain.  We have been recognised by “Premios Ciudadanos” (Citizens Awards), by the Spanish Ministry of Economic Affairs as the best company in the “Social category” for our Corporate Social Responsibility strategy, aligned with nine of the 17 UN’s SDGs.”• We support the integration of people with different intellectual abilities into our workforce.• We have adhered to the Diversity Charter 2020-2022 initiative, a project promoted by the European Commission and the Ministry of Equality, in line with our firm commitment to promoting a workplace which is socially respectful, economically sustainable and legally rigorous. As the foundation for developing the Group’s human resources strategy, we are firmly committed to digital transformation.The digital evolution in which we are immersed consists essentially of developing different areas of Human Resources, outlined here: • At Applus+, the Human Resources department in Spain has transformed its way of working by turning to robotic process automation (RPA) in a risk-controlled environment. This robot interacts with applications in the same way as a person, working in a multifunctional way to automate the tasks, in our case, of the entire recruitment process. • In 2020, we also started the implementation of “Workday” to provide Human Resources with a global tool that could work as a master-data archive and integrate analytics and cost management into the same digital system.Brand and Communications strategyOne of our main strategic objectives in the area of marketing and communication is to develop a strong global brand acclaimed as a world leader and trusted partner in all of our markets. Since 2004, the Applus+ Group has acquired and integrated over 50 companies around the world. We have redesigned our brand strategy and architecture in response to the Group’s growth, sectoral diversification, broad portfolio of services and geographical presence to combine our different identities under a singular vision, unique brand identity and shared business culture. As a result, in 2020 Applus+ was distinguished in the European Excellence Awards and the MARCOM Awards for our global brand management and internal communications strategy.The European Excellence Awards honoured Applus+ with the first prize in the “Branding” category.These awards were created in 2007 and is the leading recognition for marketing and communication in Europe.In addition, Applus+ earned two Platinum prizes at the MARCOM Awards 2020, including its most prestigious award in the “Strategic Communications – Branding” category. The Group also received the Gold award in the categories for “Corporation Annual Report” and “Video Corporate Image”. These prestigious awards recognise the best companies in the areas of Global Marketing and Corporate Communication.Within our internal communications area, a key element to communicate with our employees, Applus+ launched over 20 internal communication initiatives digitally and globally in 2020. Of special mention is our employee magazine, Appeople, which was recognised with the Platinum prize from the MARCOM Awards 2020 in two categories: “Employee Publication - Internal Magazine” and “Digital Media”. In addition, Appeople was a finalist in the European Excellence Awards 2020 in the “Internal Publication” category.At Applus+, we strive to provide our employees with the best work environment. Our dedication has received excellent results, with the Applus+ Group recognised in 2019, 2020 and 2021 as “Top Employer” in Spain and in 2021 in Latin America. The Top Employers Institute Certification Programme awards this distinction and was attained after comparing the company’s management practices for human resources with those of the best companies in the world. This certification demonstrates that Applus+ in Spain and Latin America have successfully met with the institute’s demanding standards, covering the following areas: talent strategy, workforce planning, talent acquisition, employee incorporation, training and development; performance management and leadership development; career management and replacement; compensations and benefits; and culture. Training For the Group, it is vital to ensure that the services provided in the TIC sector are performed with the greatest excellence and satisfaction, and Applus+ owes this reputation to our highly qualified personnel. This is why developing and training the expertise of our professionals is the core goal of the Group’s strategy for Human Resources.At Applus+, we work hard to maintain the necessary certifications and accreditations at a local level, and keep specialisations aligned with our high-quality standards by deploying specific training and development programmes. This training is managed locally to guarantee satisfaction for our clients’ needs and their service expectations.The Group’s online tool, ApplusNet, allows us to reach all of the locations where we provide services, and enables the Group to increase our capability to deliver our training programmes locally all around the world.The Applus+ Group provides all new employees with a professional and efficient welcome to provide their comfortable start at Applus+ and rapidly assume their role. The new employee-induction training includes areas, among others: corporate induction (corporate presentation and global policies), code of ethics and compliance, and health and safety. The training is conducted through our global eLearning platform.At the Applus+ Group, our teams’ professional and ethical integrity is fundamental to the services we deliver, so each year we reinforce the Group’s Code of Ethics policy with all of our employees though annual training. Respect for human rightsAt Applus+, we believe that business can only prosper in societies where human rights are protected and respected. The fulfilment of human rights is an integral part of our corporate culture, and we recognise that these are fundamental and universal and should be based on conventions, treaties and international initiatives, such as the principles within the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Global Compact, and the International Labour Organization.As part of our commitment to the UN Global Compact’s ten principles, the Applus+ Group works hard to support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights (Principle 1); and to make sure that we are not complicit in human rights abuses (Principle 2).The Applus+ Group’s commitment to respecting human rights is reflected within the policies and procedures followed by the Group. These include our Diversity and Equality Policy, as well as, our ESG Policy (formerly CSR Policy), Code of Ethics, Non-Discrimination Policy, Suppliers Policy, Global Anti-Corruption Policy and Procedure and QHSE Policy.In respect to human rights, among other rights, the content of the policies covers:These policies establish mechanisms to ensure the fulfilment of these commitments by our employees, and, in the case any of their provisions are broken, the company enforces disciplinary and corrective measures through the appropriate channels.In addition to these, the Modern Slavery and Child Labour regulations govern our activities in all of the countries where we operate. All of our offices must comply with local legislation relating to minimum working/school-leaving age. A non-compliance procedure has been established at all levels for our management to pursue in the event of any potential issues or breaches.To safeguard personal rights, the company has also defined practices to prohibit actions that restrict personal freedom, such as the withholding of passports, visas or work permits. Therefore, any perceived notion of such activities occurring would be rejected quickly and comprehensively remedied. Moreover, the Energy & Industry Division has a specific Human Protection Policy to reinforce our commitment to protect human rights. This policy sets guidelines regarding four fundamental rights of the Division’s employees: acceptable wage; minimum working/school-leaving age; working hours in compliance with contractual and local legislative requirements; and the elimination of modern slavery and human trafficking. Although the rest of the Group’s divisions also deploy the commitment by Applus+ to protect human rights at a divisional level, this is not currently formalised with a policy as already in place at the Energy & Industry Division. However, in the near future, a specific policy for human protection will be extended to all of the Group’s divisions.In addition, in accordance with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, where business enterprises identify that they have caused or contributed to adverse impacts on human rights, entities should provide or cooperate in their remediation through legitimate processes. To facilitate this requirement, the Applus+ Group operates an Ethics and Compliance communication channel. In 2020, the Group did not receive any complaints regarding violations of human rights.Workplace health and safety As a part of our integrated management system, Applus+ has developed and implemented policies for managing workplace health and safety, as well as fostering actions to create a corporate culture that ensures the safety and health of our employees. Our system complies with the OHSAS 18001 international standard, and we are currently in the process of migrating to the ISO 45001 standard. Our strategy consists of going beyond the legal requirements, and we pursue the objective of zero accidents.The cornerstones on which we base health and safety management within the Group are:• The Corporate Quality, Prevention and Environmental Policy  Applied to all employees at the Applus+ Group and our legal entities and activities, the policy establishes the framework for security management and includes specifications for our four divisions. The policy bolsters our commitment to manage health and safety effectively across the organisation at all levels, empowering key personnel and providing the resources to meet the Group’s required standards. • Corporate health and safety directives    These are a set of detailed guidelines for each of the minimum health and safety requirements included in the programmes, through which we can control our risks and improve our performance in the area of health and safety. • Golden Safety Rules at Applus+  These are 11 rules conceived to eliminate or reduce the risk associated with the activities that historically have had the largest impact on the Applus+ Group’s claims. • Local health and safety management systems.  With the scope covering legal entity, country and/or division, the system is defined in accordance with the international ISO 45001 workplace health and safety standards. These management systems are certified by third parties in more than 23 countries.Identification of hazards and risk assessment We identify and assess hazards in health and safety for all of our activities, works and installations before they commence or are opened. The hazard assessments are reviewed regularly when changes occur in working conditions or when safety incidents occur. As part of the process for hazard assessment in health and safety: • We consider the legal requirements, recognised codes of best practice and manufacturers’ requirements, and the requirements of third parties. • In general, we estimate the hazard levels using a risk analysis matrix and when necessary with specific evaluation methods.  • Making use of the control hierarchy as a systematic approach, we establish the preventive and corrective measures for the elimination, reduction and/or control of the assessed hazards.  To complement this, our employees carry out their own hazard assessment of the work or task before starting to verify that all of the hazards are controlled and safety measures are adopted. This allows us to identify unforeseen hazardous situations, correct them and start the work only when it is safe.  To ensure the fulfilment of these requirements, Applus+ performs internal controls at a local level, along with these internal and independent audits carried out by clients or third parties, including those done by certification entities. During 2020, there were over 64,405 in situ audits and inspections; 10,510 safety observations were notified; and we published 43 lessons learned. The results of these processes, together with investigations into accidents and incidents, assist us to continuously improve our management and performance.Coordination of business activities  Our policy defines our commitment to work with clients and suppliers, creating relationships based on trust, loyalty, transparency and mutual respect. We adopt organisational processes and structures to facilitate the relationship and fulfil their expectations, including working in a safe environment. We have developed a specific Golden Rule to establish the requirements that ensure the fulfilment of this commitment.Similarly, from our suppliers we request a strong commitment to health and safety, which we take into account during their evaluation process.Unsafe incidents and situations Among our employees, Applus+ promotes the notification of unsafe incidents and situations, and we make different communications channels available to our employees. We set specific annual objectives and follow these through indicators.Authority to stop unsafe workOur employees have the management’s full support to stop any work they consider unsafe. Our Golden Rules include the principle to confer authority “to all our employees and contractors to stop unsafe situations”.The investigation of incidents and reporting is done according to protocols set by the Group at a divisional, local or national level. These protocols provide a systematic approach to investigating, analysing and reviewing all incidents, according to the following criteria:• The aim is to ascertain the root cause of the incident and to define actions plans to prevent its reoccurrence. • We share the lessons learned with the entire organisation of such accidents, where the actual or potential consequences are relevant. • We use different methodologies depending on the degree of criticality or complexity of each incident. • We monitor and control the investigation of incidents and non-conformities to ensure that action plans are established and the most appropriate corrective or preventive measures are put into place.Follow-up and resultsTo monitor the performance of health and safety and the Group’s preventive culture, we have a reporting procedure that applies to our overall activities at a worldwide level. This process includes proactive indicators that are precursor of incidents and help measure the Group’s preventive culture and reactive indicators that refer to the Group’s performance in health and safety.The local representatives for QHSE are responsible for reporting accident data using the Governance Risk Compliance (GRC) tool and for sending the training reports to the corporate department for QHSE. The corporate department reviews and consolidates the data, performs a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the information, and prepares the related reports to be forwarded to the management team and the Board of Directors for their regular review of the process.Here are the accident indicators for the last three years. Health and safety indicators	1.10	1.00    2018    2019    2020	Total recordable cases frequency 	Severity 	(based on 200,000 working hours)	(LWD based on 1,000 working hours)201820192020Working hours (in thousands)46,22047,06543,376Fatalities102Fatality rate0.0040.0000.009Number of high-consequence work-related injuries000Rate of high-consequence work-related injuries 0.0000.0000.000Recordable cases264240165Total recordable cases frequency (TRCF)1,141,020,76Female rateMale rate-0,080,08-0,940,68Lost working days7,5805,7594,368Severity0.160.120.10Female rateMale rate-0.010.01-0.110.09Professional illness01*0Female rate010Male rate000In some countries where we operate, musculoskeletal disorders are classified as accidents as opposed to professional illnesses. As a consequence, we adopted this criterion globally for data consistency. Therefore, any cases of musculoskeletal disorders have been included as accidents in the calculations.*Carpal tunnel syndrome with 10 lost workdays. Professional illness according to the Spanish law.In 2020, we reduced the TRCF by 23% and the severity rate by 13%. With these results, we have maintained the downward trend started in 2017, with a total reduction of TRCF by 39% and the severity rate by 15% since then. The main causes of the accidents in the Group were, as in prior years, falls at the same height (slips and trips) and overexertion.In the analysis, for the contribution-by-gender to the accident rates in relation to the proportion of our employees, any bias or significant differences regarding the exposure to hazards and their consequences are observed.We are deeply saddened to report two fatal accidents within the Group in 2020, one in Spain and the other in Colombia. In both cases, we provided support to the families and to the employees impacted. We conducted indepth investigations to ascertain the root cause and the improvement actions to be taken. Based on the findings in both cases, we continue to strengthen our procedures to better protect against these incidents.Health surveillance Applus+ has implemented health surveillance programmes for employees depending on the hazards they are exposed to, which are associated with our activities or for hazards in work carried out at our clients’ premises. The main components of these programmes are medical check-ups to assess aptitude in respect of the job position and the annual epidemiological study to identify incidences on health that could be related to the work. To deliver these programmes, we use external medical services which, in accordance with the regulations of each country and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), take custody and safeguard the confidentiality of the employees’ personal data, solely bringing in an aptitude assessment relating to the job position.Moreover, through different programmes and initiatives at the local level, Applus+ facilitates access to medical services and promotes sports practice among our employees. Similarly, we have carried out several healthpromotion campaigns relating to illnesses such as diabetes in the United Arab Emirates and Costa Rica or addressing various types of cancer in Panama, Costa Rica and Indonesia. The coronavirus pandemicFrom the outset, to prevent and control the risk of contagion in our activities’ environments and with concerned about the spread of coronavirus and for the health of our employees, we established corporate directives and safety protocols. At the same time, at the country and divisional level, we set up management procedures and specified protocols, with the participation of employee representatives for health and safety matters. These protocols have been adapted to the evolution of the pandemic and to the directives established by the healthcare authorities. We maintained regular communications with our employees and provided specific channels for queries or questions. Similarly, we created an ad-hoc space on the Group’s intranet, accessible to the entire workforce, where we publish the directives, procedures and protocols defined by the company to fight against the spread of coronavirus.Among the awareness-raising actions, we highlight the creation of a training course to detail the preventive measures to be adopted during work, as well as raising awareness on the importance of the course’s contribution to controlling the pandemic. A desktop wallpaper image installed on all of the Group’s computers acted as a reminder for the basic measures for hygiene and social distancing. The measures adopted include hygiene and cleaning measures, the distribution of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), maintaining social distancing, reducing the occupancy in our offices by fostering working from home, establishing minimum safety requirements at our facilities, such as ventilation and cleaning protocols, and establishing travel restrictions. To do this, we have monitored the evolution of the pandemic by country and ascertained the risk level for each country.Similarly, we have monitored the impact of the pandemic at Applus+, gathering data using our GRC tool on the COVID-19 cases detected in all of the countries and our divisions. We have controlled and tracked the detected cases, identifying the root of contagion and taking the necessary measures, while always following the recommendations of the national authorities. According to the information gathered, the number of confirmed cases in 2020 (including quarantines) amounted to a total of 1,270 cases within 33 countries. The large majority of the cases were mild and the source of contagion came from outside the Group. Regretfully, we report that two of our employees in Mexico and Saudi Arabia developed fatal complications during their hospitalisation.Training and raising awarenessThe training of all employees on health and safety issues is an essential aspect of the company’s training programmes at the time employees join, prior to their exposure to certain risks and regularly during their employment. These programmes have a common part referring to how prevention is managed at Applus+, which is complemented with their specific training needs in each job profile or position (mechanical risks, working at heights, working in confined spaces, electrical hazards, etc.). At Applus+, we ensure all of our employees are familiarised with health and safety programmes at the Group and their operational divisions, so they understand the procedures, know the risks and preventive measures associated with their activities, and act in a safe manner. Moreover, we undertake different activities to raise awareness among our employees: The celebration of Safety Day This is an annual event in which the entire global workforce participates and to which we also invite our clients and contractors to participate. Due to the circumstances and the effects of coronavirus, the 2020 edition was held as a virtual, digital edition to ensure the participation of everyone in a safe context.In 2020, the motto was “Prevention saves lives”, which refers to both health and safety measures at work and the preventive measures to fight against the spread of coronavirus. Social wallAs a novelty for Safety Day 2020 Digital Edition, we created a social wall at the Group’s intranet, giving our employees the opportunity to share their experiences on health and safety.QHSE communication Lessons learned: more campaign in which than 43 where shared communiques were throughout the Group. issued to reinforce our Golden Safety Rules for Coordination activities at work (Nº5), Working at heights (Nº9) and Manual handling of loads (Nº2), as well as other risk factors such as exposure to extreme heat.Specific safety banners Other local initiatives on the Group’s global to foster safety, such as intranet, including a specific road safety campaigns in banner to raise awareness Chile or the “Let’s care of our internal policies for our bodies” campaign and directives to stop the in Mexico. spread of coronavirus.Appeople internal magazine of the company 	Safety awards at a local level to recognise where we also publish content relating to safety 	employees who stand out for their contributions and health.	relevant to safety and health.Health and safety trainingCARING FOR THE ENVIRONMENTGRI 102-11GRI 102-12GRI 302-1GRI 302-3GRI 303-1GRI 303-2GRI 303-3GRI 305-1GRI 305-2GRI 305-3GRI 305-4GRI 306-1GRI 308-1Focus of environmental management 	 At Applus+, we share a respect for the environment, and we promote environmental sustainability in all our Group’s operations. The lines of action we defined to achieve a sustainable performance are based on focusing our management efforts on minimising the environmental impact of our activities. These are mainly related to our offices and facilities, as well as transport to the client’s facilities.The main environmental indicators associated with the Applus+ Group’s activities are related to energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and water consumption. These indicators quantitatively display compliance with the company’s targets for improvement and the degree to which we attain our environmental commitment.Energy consumption associated with the use of electricity for lighting, equipment and heating/air conditioning, as well as for the transport to carry out work at our clients’ premises. GHG emissions originating from the consumption of fuel by our vehicle fleet, business travel, other travel by our staff, and energy use for heating and electricity. Water consumption associated with the sanitation and irrigation facilities, as well as with the IDIADA Division’s vehicle testing tracks.At Applus+, we use business intelligence (BI) to manage, control and verify the environmental indicators of energy consumption, GHG emissions and the water consumption of our facilities in the countries where we operate. Correspondingly, due to our business model, we do not depend on the extraction nor consumption of raw materials to develop our businesses’ activities, and our activities do not generate any impact as a result of an inefficient use of such resources. However, at Applus+ we choose to manage resources efficiently and sustainably, as well as optimising and continuously monitoring every defined procedure and indicator.For this reason, using the Applus+ Site Management (ASM) system, we record all consumptions together with their evidences to maintain traceability. And using QlikView, we consolidate all the reported data to offer a detailed analysis for each of our indicators.Our management framework also includes the waste generated during the development of our activities, mainly in the IDIADA and Laboratories divisions. The waste generated by both divisions requires specific storage and management conditions so that we focus our efforts on reducing, controlling and improving its management. The activities of the Applus+ Group do not generate direct impacts on biodiversity; and the locations of our facilities do not represent any risk for the natural areas in the countries where the Group operates.*A comprehensive analysis of our risks and opportunities related to climate change is included in the section Business Risks of the chapter Financial Information. Similarly, our environmental impacts have been assessed and categorised, and the results are shown in a specific section of the chapter About the Report.In 2020, the unprecedented impact of the coronavirus pandemic on our activities caused our consumption and emissions to reduce because of the travel restriction measures implemented. However, this crisis has also accelerated the transition towards a more sustainable and digital world. Home-working and video meetings helped reduce our travel emissions considerably. The use of remote communications tools within the company increased by more than 450% when making the comparison of the figures of March with those of February 2020, considering calls, chats and online meetings.The commitments governing how we act to achieve environmental protection are encompassed in the Corporate Quality, Health & Safety and Environmental Policy (QHSE), which also ensures the quality of our services and the health and safety of our employees.The policy applies to all of our employees and those working on the behalf of Applus+. Through the policy, the Applus+ Group’s management strengthens their commitment to protecting the environment, giving priority to the preventive approach over corrective measures when we carry out our activities, while providing the company with sufficient human and financial resources to continuously improve our environmental management. The Corporate Purchasing Department integrates the Group’s compulsory QHSE requirements within its supplier management processes for selection and qualification. Within the approval process, the supplier must know and adhere to the Group’s QHSE Policy. Moreover, in the initial assessment of our suppliers, we positively value those that implemented and are certified according to the ISO 14001 Standard or the European Commission’s voluntary Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS).Our suppliers’ adherence to the Policy, and consideration of the environmental management systems implemented as part of their selection and qualification, is significant. Spending with suppliers adhering to the Group’s QHSE Policy represents 73% of total purchases..To develop the policy, we implemented Environmental Management Systems (EMS) at a local level in more than 25 countries, based on the cycle of continuous improvement and developed following the international ISO 14001 Standard. Our EMS are regularly audited and our certificates are maintained over time. Energy and emissions The total energy consumed and the GHG emissions generated by the Group’s activities are obtained from electricity consumption, gas fuel and liquid fuel in the following groupings:• Electricity: comprises the electricity consumptions (lighting, equipment, etc.) and heating. • Gas fuel: comprises the consumptions of natural gas, propane, liquid propane, liquid natural gas and  compressed natural gas. • Liquid fuel: comprises the consumptions of gasoline, diesel and biodiesel oil.The Group’s Good environmental practices guide defines clear directives addressed to all of our employees to reduce energy consumption at the company’s facilities, as well as the consumption of fuel, both in our fleet vehicles and in private vehicles. Total Energy ConsumptionTotal energy consumption(renewable and non-renewable) (GJ)In 2020, the Applus+ Group’s total energy consumption was of 816,932 GJ. The liquid fuel is, by a wide margin, the most significant consumption source, representing almost half of the total energy consumption. The consumption of petrol, diesel and biodiesel is directly related to our activities because our employees travel to our clients’ facilities. Energy consumption overall decreased by 9% compared to 2019 and by 10% when compared measure for measure. There was a notable reduction due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on all of the company’s activities. However, the Group introduced measures to reduce annual consumption, such as the installation of LED illumination to reduce electricity consumption at facilities or the use of more efficient vehicles providing lower fuel consumption.As a result of the home-working measures by the Group and the reduction of activities, fuel consumption decreased dramatically in 2020 compared to the prior year. And due to the weighting of petrol and diesel within the company’s overall energy mix, a decrease in total energy consumption followed.Renewable and non-renewable sources Renewable fuel consumption (GJ)Non-renewable fuel consumption (GJ)The Group’s energy consumption can come from renewable or non-renewable sources, depending on the energy consumed. Natural gas, liquid or compressed natural gas, propane or liquid propane, petrol and diesel oil are non-renewable sources; whereas the electricity consumed can come from renewable or non-renewable sources, except the energy for heating which comes from non-renewable sources, and biodiesel comes from renewable sources.In 2020, the consumption of renewable fuels was 8,886 GJ. Within the Group, biodiesel is mostly consumed in Colombia, used by the vehicle fleet to travel to the facilities of clients. This consumption recorded a 44% increase compared to the data published in 2019 (6,150 GJ), principally for projects carried out in rural areas that require the use of other fuels, such as biodiesel; and therefore  this offset the decrease in compressed natural gas (CNG) used in their fleet of natural gas vehicles (NGV).For non-renewable fuels, in 2020 the consumption was 585,280 GJ. This group of fuels includes petrol, diesel oil and the gaseous fuels, such as natural gas, propane, LPG, LNG and CNG. On the whole, there was a 14% decrease in consumption compared to 2019, which is directly related to fewer business trips in the company’s fleet vehicles, particularly from the second quarter of 2020 in the USA and Spain because of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.	Electricity consumption (GJ)	Heating consumption (GJ)	Finally, total electricity consumption was 214,367 GJ, and heating was 8,400 GJ. There was no energy consumption within the organisation for cooling or steam, and no energy was sold.A like-for-like basis comparison shows an increase of 1%, while total electricity consumption in 2020 increased by 3% compared to the previous year. This increase is concentrated in consumption by the companies that joined the Applus+ Group, adding 2% to the global consumption.Since July 2020, sources, with a certificate of “Guarantee of Origin” issued by the National Commission of Markets and Competition (CNMC). The certification guarantees that the 50,043 GJ of the electricity consumed was produced from renewable energy sources. This represented 23% of the total electricity consumed across the Group. This major milestone highlights our commitment to sustainable energy, and represents the first step towards becoming a carbon neutral company.Energy indicators	Energy intensity	The indicator Applus+ uses to measure performance is energy intensity per (GJ / No. employees)	employee, and by using this value, we can estimate the average amount of energy used per employee.In the energy concept, we consider the total energy consumed within the company (electricity, heating, gaseous fuel and liquid fuel).In 2020, the Group’s energy intensity was 34.9 GJ per employee, which represents a decrease of 10% on the prior year.This significant decrease in intensity is due to mobility restrictions within the different countries where we operate. However, we were able to continue carrying out our activities through remote services and homeworking using the digital tools provided to all employees.EmissionsAt Applus+, we calculate our GHG emissions in accordance with Scopes 1, 2 and 3.The Scope 1 emissions are the direct emissions from the combustion of fuel, being both liquid fuel and also gaseous fuel. Fuel is the most significant source of GHG emissions within the Group, and consumption is directly related to vehicle-use for travelling to our clients’ facilities. Moreover, these also include the emissions from gas boilers for heating and for the performing tests at our facilities.The Scope 2 emissions are the indirect emissions from the generation of energy for the electricity and heating at our premises.In 2020, a significant drop occurred compared to the prior year due to three significant factors:• The change from the emissions of the energy mix; in other words, the emissions from each country’s original energy source. For 2020, we used the values from the IEA (2019) Emission Factors for electricity and heat generation report. This change led to a decrease of 12%. • The usage of electricity from renewable sources mainly in Spain was 23% of the Applus+ Group’s electricity consumption and therefore GHG emissions are avoided. • And finally, the promotion of home-working and the lockdowns of certain facilities due to the impact of the pandemic, also caused a slight decrease in emissions.The Scope 3 emissions are the direct emissions not included in Scope 2, produced outside Applus+. The emissions considered in this concept are:• Activities relating to fuel and energy not included in Scopes 1 or 2. • Business travel (by plane, train and taxi). GHG Emissions. Scope 1 (t CO2 eq)47,788GHG Emissions. Scope 2 (t CO2 eq)20,747• Employees commuting between work and home.Scope 320192020Emissions due to electricity transmission and distribution losses (1)1,7391,164The scope of countries included:(1) Andorra, Angola, Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Czech        Republic, Denmark, Ecuador, Egypt, Finland, France, Emissions due to the electricity value chain (1)	Germany, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Kuwait, 	Emissions due to the fuel value chain  (1)	Malaysia, Mexico, Mongolia, Netherlands, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Norway, Oman, Panama, Papua New Guinea, 	Emissions due to the heating value chain (1)	Peru, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Turkey, 	Emissions due to the employee commuting  (2)	United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, Uruguay and USA.Business trip w/ Plane and Train (3)7,5841,898 Business trip w/ Taxi (4)61(2) Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Panama, Spain and USA.(3) Angola, Australia, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Netherlands, Spain, United Kingdom and USA.(4) SpainIn general, the impact of the pandemic reduced our emissions (Scope 1, 2 and 3) in 2020 compared to 2019.A detailed review of the data shows that Scope 1 emissions decreased by 14%, due mainly to the reduction in fuel consumption for vehicle-development testing at the IDIADA Division, and from a reduction in the services delivered from the Energy & Industry Division. As in previous years, the Group worked constantly to reduce the impact of direct emissions since these make up the majority of the direct emissions from the company. This is why the average emissions for fleet vehicles from our largest supplier recorded a two percent reduction compared to 2019. This demonstrates that the Group’s vehicle fleet is becoming more efficient and environmentally-friendly.Following our commitment to reducing emissions derived from fuels, in 2020 the Group added to the electric vehicles on our fleet from the principal vehicle supplier to 13.  We are making these changes gradually and without jeopardizing the efficiency of the service in our operations.However, Scope 2 emissions recorded a larger reduction of 27%. Much of this reduction was achieved in Spain, where the Group emitted the equivalent of 4,008 tons less of CO2, thanks to the energy consumed from predominantly renewable sources, with zero emissions guaranteed by the CNMC’s “Guarantee of Origin” certificate. In addition to this, a change in the electricity-emission factor of countries resulted in a 12 percent reduction in emissions, along with the general reduction that the Group recorded as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.Finally, for Scope 3 emissions, we consider each concept separately because of the different scopes these have. However, each of the scopes recorded a decrease compared to 2019. The emissions from electricity transmission and distribution losses, and its value chain, reduced by approximately 30% as a result of the decrease in consumption. Similarly, in the emissions resulting from the fuel value chain, fuel consumption fell by 14% in parallel with the reduction of fuel consumption across the Group. The emissions in respect of our employees commuting reduced by 11%. This reduction followed measures taken to reduce commuting during the pandemic (9%) and a change in the emission factors used for the calculation (2%). Finally, emissions generated by transport for our employees’ movement by plane, train and taxi fell dramatically by almost 75%, attributed to a reduction in business trips and an increase in remote meetings.Emissions indicatorsIntensity of GHG Emissions (t CO2 eq/No. employees)To calculate our employees’ average GHG emissions, we use emission intensity per employee as an indicator. In 2020, this was of 2.42 tCO2eq/ employee, including the values of Scopes 1 and 2. Compared to 2019, we saw a decrease caused by the change of energy-mix emissions, the usage of electricity from renewable sources, implementation of efficiency processes and the impact of restrictions due to the pandemic.Comparing emissions intensity year on year, there was a 19% reduction resulting 2018	2019	2020	from a 18% reduction in overall emissions (Scope 1 and 2), for the reasons outlined previously. The decrease in emissions-per-employee is the result of a lower consumption of fuels and the Group’s commitment to use electricity from renewable sources. These adopted measures have been made without jeopardizing the delivery of services to the client, while maintaining or increasing the number of employees.Waste, water and effluents  Water use Water consumption (ML) The Group’s total water consumption during 2020 was 655ML, representing an increase in water use of 2%.The main reason for this increase is due to the inclusion of consumption from the IDIADA Division’s activities in the USA, which require large amounts of water consumption for vehicle development testing.In fact, the like-for-like basis comparison, there was a 12% decrease, due to less activity at the IDIADA Division’s facilities in Tarragona (Spain) and their efficiency achievements when recovering the water used in their services.The water used within the organisation can have different origins: water from third-party suppliers (308 ML) or groundwater (347ML). Total groundwater consumption has decreased by 9% (379 ML) compared to 2019. This decrease is mainly recorded at IDIADA’s facilities in Tarragona, due to a reduction in activity.Part of the water used in their activities comes from underground (344 ML). The water is used in buildings, the watering of green areas and for four out of its 14 vehicle-testing tracks: two braking tracks, a wet pavement driving track and a fatigue track. The test tracks have the most intensive water consumption, and to minimise this, the water is filtered and recycled for reuse, without requiring grease and hydrocarbon separators. In this process, the water loss is only between 7-11%.The environmental controls performed are:• For water used on tracks and in buildings, the pH and chlorine levels are measured.• For the track water, osmosis treatment is available and its conductivity is analysed.• And for the water solely used in buildings, its organic and chemical parameters are controlled.Waste managementOur activities mostly generate urban waste and other assimilable waste, such as paper, plastic packaging, print toners and office supplies.The directives set out in the Group’s Good environmental practices guide, as well as the local regulations applicable for waste management, govern the rules of our behaviour, applying the 3 Rs formula: Reduce, Reuse and Recycle. Both at our offices and when providing services at the clients’ facilities, all employees must apply these good practices for generated waste management.At our offices, waste segregation is mandatory when the country has a public or private infrastructure for selective recycling and treatment. The office and workplace managers are responsible for providing the resources needed to comply with these management policies, as well as for adherence.Moreover, to reduce the consumption of paper, toner and ink, the Good environmental practices guide establishes certain action guidelines.The IDIADA and Laboratories Divisions also generate hazardous waste and other types of waste which, by their nature, require specific management; for example, tyre waste at the IDIADA Division’s vehicleproving grounds or inert waste from fire-resistance tests at the Laboratories Division. The hazardous and specific waste generated at both divisions is always managed through duly authorised companies, and the documentary evidence is always retained as required to verify the traceability of this management.
Environmental action New EV charging station at the IDIADA DivisionAt the IDIADA Division, we installed an EV charging station to offer the latest available technologies in the automotive sector, following strict environmental and safety regulations.This new EV charging installation is equipped with four chargers: two with a power rating of 50 kW and two with 175 kW, which can reach up to 350 kW. Moreover, the installation is ready to accommodate up to six additional chargers, with one more prepared for heavy goods vehicles or for two small cars.Since the charging processes can be complex, especially with prototypes, a fire-extinguishing system has been installed to offer the utmost safety at all times, and the facility is constantly monitored for any hazardous situation. In the event of discharged from the vehicles or batteries, the liquid containment systems ensure proper storage of the fluid so that it can be treated to preserve the environment.The entire service is managed and supervised remotely using software designed by our engineers at the IDIADA Division, which allows us to manage all of the processes involved before, during and after each charging cycle. The users of this service will be able to obtain specific information about each charging cycle, and users can also obtain real-time information on the availability and location of these and other chargers.More sustainable non-destructive testing servicesIn the Netherlands, Applus+ RTD, a leader in the development of non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques, is transitioning towards using organic products for the x-ray film-developing processes. These new products eliminated all the compounds contained in traditional film-processing, which were harmful to human health, carcinogenic and hazardous to the environment. One of these new products uses vitamin C as a substitute for the hydroquinone and aldehyde, and in the other, the use of boric acid was eliminated.Moreover, the containers for these products are made of polyethylene and can therefore be recycled. In addition, sixty percent of the cardboard packaging comes from recycled paper.These measures allow us to offer services which are increasingly sustainable and environmentally friendly.Digital tools to increase the sustainability of our servicesApplus+ developed the AuditA+ and GEOAPP Pollution tools to digitalise our inspection activities in the field. This reduces the paper consumed when delivering these activities, and the transfer of information to our databases and those of our clients and partners is more reliable and effective.Importantly, we also improve our service offer to clients by verifying the status of inspections in real-time. The GEOAPP Pollution tool focuses on soil and groundwater characterisation, and the AuditA+ tool allows the user to design and generate recording formats for deployment in the field.Our environmental contribution by TIC servicesThe TIC services provided by Applus+ make a significant positive environmental impact by assisting our clients to reduce their environmental impact and protect against or reduce environmental risks on their assets, products and services. Since 2019, the Group has been measuring and increasing our revenues from Green Services to adapt and extend these services progressively in order to meet our clients’ needs in their transition to a low-carbon economy.At Applus+, Green Services are defined according to the European Union’s classification: “Those which make a substantial contribution to the goal of achieving a low-carbon economy by reducing the CO2 emissions, as well as to improve the performance in relation to other environmental goals.”In 2020, circa €200 million (13% total revenue) came from services focused on reducing and/or mitigating environmental impacts. Some examples of these services are those related to renewables, control of the automotive emissions, surveys of environmental parameters, energy audits, waste management, and innovation projects for automotive eco-engines and lightweight aerospace materials.Relevant projectsOur greatest environmental contribution comes through our services. Although most of our TIC services generally contribute to sustainability through their very nature, we identified certain services that are specifically oriented towards climate-change mitigation, based on the taxonomy applied by the EU. In this regard, in 2020 13% of the Group’s income came from these services, which support a sustainable economy. We highlight here some these key services and projects.Verification of recycling in Portugal  From the Energy & Industry Division in Portugal, Applus+ contributes to the continued improvement of recycling figures in this country through our service to verify the quality of local-waste separation. According to the Association of Waste Management in Portugal (ESGRA), the collection of urban waste in the country increased by 18% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019.In addition to verifying the correct segregation of waste, Applus+ studies the materials to develop new segregation methods and monitors compliance with the applicable legislation.Vehicle emission inspectionsThe Applus+ Group works with governments at all levels (municipal, regional, state and international) to create customised solutions that assist in maintaining cleaner air, while providing quality services and fostering safer roads. Applus+ manages comprehensive statutory vehicle inspection and maintenance programmes that together account for more than 20 million emissions control inspections a year.Through our global technical expertise, we actively contribute to ensuring greater control of vehicle emissions and promote the improvement of air quality in many countries around the world.Technical assistance on new wind turbine-projectsApplus+ participates in the most advanced engineering assignments in the wind turbine industry, providing wide-ranging technical assistance. The wind turbine farms in Scotland and Mexico are some of the most noteworthy projects on which we collaborate.Scotland’s new offshore project for wind turbine generation will be the first in the world to feature wind turbines generating more than 9 MW, located 15 km off the coast of Aberdeen. Applus+ will certify the welding work on the complex marine structures by carrying out non-destructive testing (NDT).Applus+ also participates in a wind turbine project in Fenicias (Mexico), ensuring that the project meets our customer’s specifications in terms of quality, cost and time. The project will have a 168 MW power rating, with 42 wind turbines each generating 4 MW of power.The services offered by Applus+ contribute towards fostering renewable energy sources that reduce GHG emissions and contribute towards environmental protection.

BUILDING A BETTER SOCIETYGRI 413-1Social action In 2020, Applus+ continued our programme for social action in different countries, in which the following projects are noteworthy:In Italy, Applus+ organised an internal lottery called “Lotteria della Befana”, donating all the proceeds to the Children’s Oncology Department of Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital.In Spain, Applus+ organised the “Súmate, Operación Solidaria” (Join the Solidarity Operation) to help those who suffer the most from the severe economic and social impact of the coronavirus pandemic and who encounter the greatest difficulty in accessing basic food and hygiene products.Since the project was launched May 2020, 218 tonnes of basic products have been distributed through “Banco de Alimentos de Madrid” (Madrid Food Bank), “Cáritas Diocesana de Madrid” (Diocesan Charity of Madrid) and “Cruz Roja Comunidad de Madrid” (Red Cross Community in Madrid), contributing towards feeding 2,100 families for a month. Applus+ participated in the deliveries of products, donations in kind, transport and logistics services, as well as with monetary contributions. The project is supported by the Administration for the Community of Madrid, through the Department for Social Policy, Family, Equality and Childbirth, which resulted from a collaboration agreement signed through the KPMG Foundation.The Applus+ Group’s supervisors who work at the Karratha gas plant in Western Australia attended a training activity for cultural awareness, organised by the Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation, to foster respect for the culture of Australian Aborigines.With a tour through the Murujuga National Park, the supervisors could get to know one of the largest petroglyphs collections in the world, the local flora and the fauna used by the Aborigines in the past, and discover the cultural importance the Aborigines give to the North West Shelf region.The training activities were completed with a presentation on local history, the Aboriginal tradition and culture, and the work that the Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation is doing to preserve both their history and the Murujuga National Park.For the past eight years, Applus+ has sponsored the Solidarity Race organised by the Universidad Autónoma de Barcelona (UAB). In each edition, the race has attracted 2,000 participants on average.In 2020, the pandemic forced us to set up a new format to continue our contribution to the cause. Through a mobile application, each participant chose the route and their distance, and they totalled the solidarity kilometres run and donations. In doing so, many races in one event were run from many places, integrating both the collective and individual challenges.In Costa Rica, Applus+ has run a solidarity project for the daily donation of food to families affected by COVID-19.Our services’ contribution to developmentAt Applus+, we are committed to local development through different activities and services in the places we operate: The Group’s TIC services assist to protect operations, assets and the quality of products in sectors such as for energy, particularly from renewable sources, telecommunications, automation, oil and gas, construction, mining and aerospace. In many cases, we support the implementation of key projects for a country’s structural development, thereby contributing to social and economic growth locally.Moreover, at Applus+ we contribute to local communities by promoting their employability and training: • Fostering employment by directly hiring local personnel and contracting local suppliers for our services. In 2020, locally hired personnel represented 88% and local suppliers represented 95%. • Training local experts to acquire specific technical skills and sharing our experience acquired through the different areas of our business. Relevant projectsHealthcare in the Netherlands Applus+ is contributing to healthcare in the Netherlands. The traditional scanners used in brain and back diagnosis, such as hernias, tumours and Parkinson’s disease, have been enabled to conduct examinations for COVID-19 by a leading technology-development company in the healthcare sector.

Ethics and transparency are key principles which guide the Group’s management to continue earning the trust of our stakeholders.The Corporate Governance framework at Applus+ has been developed by taking into account the CNMV‘s Good Governance Code for listed companies, which was amended in June 2020, and internationallyaccepted best practice, including the feedback from our stakeholders. The continuous development, review and improvement of the framework are the cornerstones of the Applus+ Group’s strategy in the area of corporate governance.The Group’s principles of good governance are integrated into the core rules of governance and have been developed through the approval of specific policies. As a result of the CNMV’s approval of their new version of the Good Governance Code in June 2020, and the Applus+ Group’s continuous improvement plan, the Board of Directors at Applus+ has proceeded to amend and/or approve some of the existing documents, the regulations of the respective committees and a new policy:BASIC RULESPOLICIESApplus+ by-laws Remuneration Policy of the DirectorsRegulations of the Board of DirectorsApplus+ Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance Policy (ESG, formerly CSR)  Regulations of the Board of Directors  Policy for the Communication of Economic-financial, Non-financial and Corporate Information and Communication and Contact with Shareholders, Institutional Investors and Proxy Advisors.  Internal regulations for conduct in the security marketsApplus+ Director’s Selection PolicyAudit Committee RegulationsRisk Management PolicyAppointments and Remuneration Committee Regulations Diversity and Equality PolicyEnvironmental, Social and Corporate Governance Committee Regulations (ESG, formerly CSR)As a listed company, Applus+ prepares an Annual Corporate Governance Report (ACGR), an Annual Report on the Remuneration of Directors, and this report, all of which are available at the Group’s website, and where we publish comprehensive information yearly. Overall, the ACGR shows a good level of performance by the Applus+ Group according to CNMV recommendations, with an effective compliance ratio of 87%. Of the 64 recommendations in total, 10 are not applicable to the Applus+ Group. Out of the remaining 54 recommendations applicable to the Group: 47 were complied with; and 7 are partially complied with. THE MAIN MILESTONES ACHIEVED IN 20201. Amendment to the Regulations of the Board of Directors, approved in December 2020, to adapt the policy to the amended Good Governance Code, among others.2. Amendment to Director’s Selection Policy, expressly stating the goal of 40% of women members on the BOD for the year 2022, as well as stating our commitment to society for gender diversity and promotion of women to directorships. 3. Amendment to the ESG Policy (formerly CSR).4. Approval of the Regulations of each of our Committees: Audit, Appointments and Remuneration and ESG.5.

GROUP MANAGEMENTBusiness ethics and complianceGRI 102-12GRI 102-16GRI 102-17GRI 205-2GRI 206-1GRI 412-2We are firmly committed to strong business ethics, which help us to prevent, identify and stop any behaviour that threatens our principles of conduct.At the Applus+ Group, our practices and services are guided by our ethics and compliance policies and value-driven management practices because these achieve more efficient and competitive results over the long-term. The Group’s commitment to business ethics is managed by the Board of Directors through the ESG Committee and the Chief Compliance Officer. They ensure ethical behaviour is integrated across all of our business units, geographies and operations through our Code of Ethics and associated policies. The Applus+ Code of Ethics is articulated in a framework that establishes a set of principles and ethical values to guide our professionals’ everyday behaviour, wherever we operate in the world. These principles are Integrity, Transparency, Impartiality and Independence, and Responsibility. Our Code of Ethics is available in 24 languages to all of our stakeholders around the world, either at our website or at our Applus+ Global Intranet. The Code of Ethics sets out the values, principles and rules of conduct that guide our operations and activities:Our Code of Ethics considers different scenarios, needs, risks and concerns that arise over time. Importantly, the Group’s Code of Ethics operates as a reference guide for the ethical principles that should inspire all of our professional activities. To ensure all of our professionals understand, align and follow the values and ethical principles set out in the Code of Ethics and related policies, each year we deploy an annual online course on the Group’s Code of Ethics and Global Anti-Corruption Policy and Procedure. This training explores different topics and situations on ethical standards and is aimed to serve as a reminder for all of our professionals at Applus+, and forms part of the induction process of each new recruit. New policies, changes and upgrades in our Code of Ethics and related policies are always a special focus in the yearly training calendar.Every year during the annual training course on the Code of Ethics, each professional renews their commitment to the Code. Each signs an initial commitment to the Code of Ethics and related policies when they join the company as part of their work contract. All third parties with whom we work must know, understand and follow the principles within our Code of Ethics. To assure this, we make the Code available in all languages on the Group’s website.In addition, our suppliers have access to our Code of Ethics and Global Anti-Corruption Policy and Procedure and sign a General Compliance certification where they state their commitment to the Code and its policies. Our partners in consortiums are asked to sign this same certification, where Applus+ is the managing partner of the consortium. Those third parties, as agents or those that can perform activities on behalf of Applus+, must follow a strict approval process. This includes, apart from knowing and committing to our Code of Ethics and Global AntiCorruption Policy, reputational and integrity tests before initiating any type of relationship together.The pandemic caused by the COVID-19 has not altered the training process for Code of Ethics or its associated policies, since it was already being taught online through the Applusnet corporate-training platform. However, the travel restrictions caused by the pandemic have forced the company to adapt to new ways of conducting compliance investigations, essentially in regards to interviews and follow-up meetings on the implementation of a number of policies and procedures with the various functional areas of the business. ETHICS AND COMPLIANCE COMMUNICATION CHANNELThe Applus+ Ethics and Compliance Communication Channel is a mechanism for Applus+ professionals and third parties (clients, suppliers and business parties) to:  • Raise any doubts or queries regarding the correct interpretation and application of our Code of Ethics or any other internal regulations at Applus+ (QUESTIONS); or  • Notify any indication or suspicion of any act or breach that may violate the rules of the Code and its regulations (COMPLAINTS). Communication to the Ethics and Compliance Communication Channel may be sent by completing an electronic form available at the Applus+ Global Intranet, as well as at the Applus+ website.  The channel’s terms of use detail its underlying principles (good faith, confidentiality, lack of reprisal), and explains how to submit a query or complaint, as well as outlining the process for managing any complaint.  We also have the Procedure that regulates the management of the communication channel.  The Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) is responsible for managing this communication channel and directing and coordinating any investigation. In 2020, there were 104 communications received, with 93 of these opened for investigation into potential breaches. Out of the 93 communications opened for investigation, 77 cases were closed in 2020, and 16 continue to be open and under investigation and management by the CCO. Out of the 77 cases investigated, there was evidence found in 41 cases of irregular behaviour or breaches of the Code of Ethics values and/ or the Global Anti-Corruption Policy and Procedure. All of these cases resulted in some type of correction or disciplinary action.Out of the 104 communications, 83 came from internal sources and 21 came from people external to the Group. 68 percent of the cases used the formal communication channels of the company to send the allegations; 25% contacted someone from the management team, and the remaining came in via an audit process or other sources.COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMApplus+ has implemented a Compliance Management System (CMS) to enable the Group to detect possible criminal offences under the Spanish Criminal Code, UK Bribery Act and the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The Group’s CMS has, at its core, the Code of Ethics and Anti-Corruption Policy and Procedure. However, the CMS also comprises a series of other internal policies, such as the Policy on Conflicts of Interest, Purchasing Policies, Suppliers Policies, or the Policy on the use of company resources. The CMS is included in the scope of the periodic controls carried out by the Internal Audit Department. Our commitment to a creditable, effective and efficient business ethics has led us to adapt the Global Purchasing and Supplier’s Policies to reduce bureaucratic burden, focusing all efforts on the most important suppliers.Furthermore, in awareness of the increasing importance of diversity and inclusion, the Compliance Department has collaborated in the drafting of the new Group’s Policy on Diversity and Equality.To monitor and manage situations of a conflict of interest at Applus+ that may arise in the activities between employees’ personal interest and the interest of the company, to which all professionals owe a duty of loyalty, a conflict-of-interest form has been created, aimed at all new recruits, but not applicable to existing employees. The questionnaire deals with a number of contexts that could involve a conflict of interest between the parties, particularly areas that could lead to nepotism.The answers given in the forms are analysed by Human Resources, who check that personnel are not faced with hierarchical-related problems that could give rise to subjective decisions on employment issues or professional advancement. The Chief Compliance Officer, under the supervision of the ESG Committee, is responsible for taking the necessary measures to raise awareness of the CMS among the professionals at Applus+ and to monitor adherence to the compliance system. To strengthen the effective implementation of the Group’s CMS across our global operations, in 2019 the Group defined the principle core compliance controls at Applus+ (CORE Compliance document) for Country Managers, Finance Managers and Human Resources teams. Having consolidated its CMS policies and procedures, in 2020 the Compliance Department focused its global efforts on ensuring the policies’ effective implementation across the company’s divisions and regions. To understand the possible challenges in the implementation of the policies, Applus+ held regular meetings with the different corporate functional areas in each country, as a means to address these problems.Correspondingly, the internal control system was adapted to the current regulations to ensure all managers follow applicable compliance requirements. Compliance controls include all of the Applus+ Group’s internal policies and procedures comprised within our CMS. Managers must sign a statement of compliance to demonstrate it is being applied correctly. CORRUPTION AND BRIBERYApplus+ has a Global Anti-Corruption Policy and Procedure to prevent, detect, investigate and remediate any corrupt act within the Group. The main commitments include: • To do business legally, ethically and professionally worldwide by complying with the anti-corruption laws relevant in the countries where the Group carries out our business; and to ensure that professionals at Applus+ and other third parties carry out business in a consistent manner. • Fighting against bribery, kickbacks, improper or illegal payments, gifts or contributions, and any other improper method of seeking favourable treatment. The divisional Executive Vice-Presidents, under the leadership of the CCO, are responsible for monitoring compliance with the Policy and Procedure.As stated in the Global Anti-Corruption Policy and Procedure, any sponsorship or donation must be legitimated, formalised and authorised. In 2020, we contributed € 29,630 to foundations and not-for-profit entities. Following our policies, Applus+ has not given donations to political parties.The Global Anti-Corruption Policy and Procedure regulates both our professionals’ behaviour and relations with third parties, as well as the process of mergers and acquisitions to prevent any issues related to potential corruption.  Based on our continuous-improvement process, our crime prevention model will include new developments in the future.MARKET COMPETITIONCompliance with antitrust and competition laws is one of the values covered by the Group’s Code of Ethics. The Group’s Competition Policy and Bids and Tenders Policy defines the criteria to ensure compliance. The Group has specific lines of internal review and approval concerning bidding processes, consortiums or trade association membership, ensuring the involvement of the Legal Department at Applus+ as required.In 2020, no legal proceeding was initiated against the Applus+ Group, nor has the company been served with claims for unfair or monopolistic competition practices. Furthermore, no sanction has been imposed, pecuniary or otherwise, due to the practices described above.INFORMATION SECURITY MANAGEMENTPersonal data protection and privacy is one of the values upheld within our Code of Ethics. Therefore, we strive to protect an individual’s privacy and their corresponding fundamental rights when processing personal data.All of our professionals must respect the basic rules stated within the Policy, and be aware that laws related to data protection vary in the different countries where the Group operates.To manage GDPR compliance, Applus+ has the following internal policies and procedures:Applus+ Data-Protection Policy, Policy and Procedure for Management of Individual Rights and Data Breach Policy.Information security is also safeguarded through the Applus+ Group’s policy on the use of IT resources, and through the confidentiality clauses included in the contracts signed by our employees and clients (confidentiality clauses and non-disclosure agreements) and subsequent internal processes. In the case of the IDIADA Division, the specific Information Technologies General Policy is applied. In addition, the Applus+ Group appointed a data-protection team, including divisional or country managers, responsible for ensuring the implementation and compliance of GDPR and for managing any concerns raised over data protection. The Corporate Legal Department, with whom the team holds periodic follow-up meetings, coordinates these managers and defines action plans where applicable. The Group provides training (online and on-site) regularly to raise awareness about personal-data matters and regulatory compliance.  In 2020, due to the disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic among others, the Group had to postpone its training plans, but will launch online training for our EU employees in the first half of 2021, which benefits the newly-joined employees arriving through the recent acquisitions.In 2020, the Group did not suffer any material leakage, theft or loss of information, and the Group did not receive any claim or complaint in relation to information security or data protection. However, during 2020, Applus+ answered approximately 3,500 enquiries on exercising data-privacy rights through the channels dedicated to these purposes.  These enquiries were mostly related to our statutoryvehicle-inspection activities in Spain. In 2020, the Applus+ Group continued to develop the continuous-improvement programme in cybersecurity, which includes different initiatives related to the four pillars of its strategy:
GRI 101GRI 102-46Focus of sustainability reportingThis report reflects the Group’s activities carried out during 2020 (1st January to 31st December) and is published annually. The content has been prepared in accordance with: • GRI Standards, essential option.  • Spanish Law 11/2018, which amends the Commercial Code’s revised text of the Capital Companies Act approved by Royal Legislative Decree 1/2010, and the Audit Act 22/2015, 20th July 2015, on the matters of non-financial information and diversity. Similarly, this report is part of the Applus+ Group’s ‘Communication on Progress’ (CoP) of the UN’s Global Compact 2020. The appendices to this document include a table of cross references relating to the information required under the GRI Standards, the United Nations’ Global Compact, and Act 11/2018, 28thDecember. Similarly, for the first time this report includes detailed financial information, which was priory included in the Applus+ Group’s Annual Report.The following principles have been used to define the content and quality of this report:  The content of this report is based on the assessment of the interests and processes of participation for our interested parties (see the Materiality analysis).The Applus+ Group presents our performance with reference to a broad sustainability context, reflected in the recognised industry, local, regional and global instruments (see Sustainability approach).The most significant issues for Applus+ and our interest groups have been identified through materiality analysis.

As a result, we obtained a list of 21 issues, organised into four areas: Governance, Operations, Company and Environment.   With regards to the prior year’s issues, some eliminations have been made (“Role in the development of public policies”, “Financial transparency” and “Operational eco-efficiency”) due to the low scores attained in the materiality analysis for 2019, and several issues have been integrated on conclusion that these were clearly related (“Business model” with “Investment and growth strategy”; “Recognitions” with “Management systems”; and “Talent attraction and loyalty” with “Talent development and recognition”). The new issue “Green services” was included due to its growing importance to the Applus+ Group and to our stakeholders in respect of its relationship to environmental protection and climate change.  • Through personal interviews with company directors (divisional and corporate functions) and regional managers from all the Group’s geographical areas, we assessed each issue according to its relevance by considering both the points of view at Applus+ and the points of view of our main stakeholder groups.The results of the interviews led to the new Materiality Matrix, which synthesises the importance of the issues material to Applus+ vis-a-vis those relevant to our stakeholders.1,0 1,1 1,2 1,3 1,4 1,5 1,6 1,7 1,8 1,9 2,0 2,1 2,2 2,3 2,4 2,5 2,6 2,7 2,8 2,9 3,0Applus+ RELEVANCE

GRI 203-2The company’s activities generate certain impacts in the geographies in which we operate. These impacts, which in many cases are positive, are related to the issues analysed in the materiality analysis.DIRECT IMPACTSGreen servicesWe calculate the direct impact taking into consideration 17 issues, including the 16 issues that concluded to be material in the materiality analysis performed in 2020, as well as “Energy and climate change” due to the issue’s relevance to our stakeholder groups.AREA ISSUESThe methodology used to calculate direct impacts is based on the use of performance indicators relating to each material issue. Each issue is weighted from 0% to 100% using the following criteria: • Prioritisation of the material issues by the stakeholder groups. • Prioritisation of the material issues by the Applus+ Group. The indicators used are the following:TOPIC/NDICATORS:Risk management. Risk management system, which integrates economic, social and environmental issues.Business model and strategy. Business/ESG integrated strategy and action plans.Brand and reputation. Rating in the TIC sector; fines in any field. Economic performance. Revenue tendency; Adjusted Operating Profit tendency.Corporate Governance. Rules governing a company’s behaviour. Code of Ethics and Compliance. Breaches resolved; Employees trained in Code of Ethics/ESG Policy; Compliance control. Stakeholder engagement. Effective bi-directional communication with stakeholders.TOPIC/NDICATORS:Innovation. Hours dedicated to innovation; Patents.Service quality and customer relationship. Medium-to longterm clients.Privacy and data security. Policy implementation.IT Strategy and digital transformation. Implementation of action plans.TOPIC/NDICATORS:Health and Safety. Accident rate; Hours dedicated to train on health and safety.Talent management. Development programmes to retain and attract talented people.Diversity, inclusion and equality. Work integration programmes: No. of women/men within the Group and in management positions. Respect for human rights. Human Rights Policy and action plans.TOPIC/NDICATORS:Energy and climate change. GHG emissions intensity and intensity rate of energy reduction.Green services. Services helping out clients to reduce or mitigate their climate change impact.First, each value obtained for each material issue is weighted according to its importance to Applus+ and to our stakeholder groups. The stakeholder groups’ expectations and the external context are considered as part of this evaluation process. To conclude, a value between 1 to 5 is obtained for each indicator by assigning quantitative or qualitative criteria, taking into account our company’s performance within the framework defined by the stakeholders’ expectations.The main impacts are the following:• Service quality and the relationship with the client.  It is most important for the Applus+ Group to orient it services towards exceeding our clients’ expectations. This issue is also important for our stakeholder groups because it is directly related to technological progress and socio-economic development.  • Code of Ethics and Compliance. The stakeholders and Applus+ positively value and welcome the implementation of practices that ensure the development of a responsible and sustainable business.  • Health and safety. At Applus+, we consider safe working and behaviour from employees to be crucial, and this has been especially relevant during the current pandemic. • Brand and reputation. It is fundamental to Applus+ that our stakeholders perceive the company’s image as consistent with the values we hold.On analysing the information according to the different grouping to which the different material issues belong, we observe that the areas of “Operations” and “Environment” are those with the greatest impact (values greater than 70%), followed by the areas of “Society” and “Governance”, with an intermediate impact (>60%). These results have been impacted by the pandemic.INDIRECT IMPACTSSimilarly, to analyse the indirect impacts of our activities on our stakeholders, we focus on the 16 issues that were material in the analysis for 2020 and on the “Energy and climate change” issue because of its relevance for our stakeholder groups.Applus+ INDIRECT IMPACTSTopicIndirect ImpactEmployeesClientsInvestorsSocietyPartnersGovernmentsSuppliersGOVERNANCERisk managementOur risk management allows the Group to be prepared for a changing context and offer our stakeholders a stable and resilient company.Business model and strategy Our company operates according to a clear strategy and structured plans to provide stakeholders with confidence in a solid business.Brand and reputationOur image is associated with credibility, which guarantees our company’s continuity.Economic performance Our strategic objectives linked  to financial results allow stakeholders to view the Group as  a sustainable business.Corporate GovernanceThe rules for ethical and responsible behaviour of which the company’s management follow have an impact on an improving and more lasting relationship with our employees, clients, partners and suppliers.Code of ethics andCompliance Integrity and responsibility, by which we run our operations and decision-making, contribute to extend these values to people working with Applus+, as well as the rest of our stakeholdersStakeholder engagementThe permanent dialogue with our stakeholders facilitates the implementation of actions to meet their expectation and decisions taking into account all points of viewOPERATIONInnovationOur intense innovation work boosts development and growth in different fields of knowledge in over 70 countries.Service quality and customer relationship Offering an excellent, tailored service contributes to the development of companies and industrial sectors around the worldPrivacy and data securityOur policies favour a strong relationship of trust with our clients, employees, suppliers, associations and public administrations.IT Strategy and digital transformationThe digitalisation of our services has an impact on the environment and, therefore, delivers an improvement for society, as well as in our clients’ operations.SOCIETYHealth and SafetyOur health and safety operating policies contribute to create a culture of employee protection all over the worldTalent managementWe influence the levels of local knowledge and promote socio-economic development in the geographies in which we work by creating jobs and developing our workforce.Diversity, inclusion and equalityWith the application of diversity, inclusion and equality principles and practices, we are contributing to extending these values in many communities around the world.Respect for human rightsApplying our human rights principles help extend these values to every country where we operateENVIRONMENTEnergy and climate changeMany of our services contribute to implementing a low-carbon economy and help clients to reduce their carbon footprintGreen servicesWe promote improvements in sustainability by helping our clients to reduce the environmental impact of their operations.We set up annual corporate-governance road shows to maintain the constructive dialogue held with institutional investors and proxy advisors, in line with our Policy for the communication of economicfinancial, non-financial and corporate information and communication and contact with shareholders, institutional investors and proxy advisors.

The scope for countries is the same as that of the financial perimeter. ElectricityThe energy consumption of electricity and heating in kilowatt hours (kWh) is converted into gigajoules (GJ). The carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of the electricity are the product of the energy consumption in kWh and each country’s emission factors.The sources for the conversion factors are:• GJ value: Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) (2013), Units & Conversions. • TCO2 value: International Energy Agency (IEA). Emission factors: Database documentation (2019 edition). CO2 emission factors for electricity and heat generation for world countries (in CO2 per kWh, 1990 to 2017).Gaseous Fuel and Liquid FuelThe gaseous fuel may be reported in cubic metres (m3), cubic feet (ft3), kilowatt hours (kWh) or in kilograms (kg), although the standard unit is cubic metres. The liquid fuel liquid may be reported in litres (L), gallons (gal) or monetary units, and the reference unit for calculations is in litre(s).In both cases, the m3 of gaseous fuel and the litres of liquid fuel are converted to energy units in gigajoules (GJ), using the product of the volume (m3 or L), the density (kg/m3 or kg/L) and the lower calorific power (GJ/kg).To ascertain the GHG emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O, we use the product of the energy units and the emission factors for each gas. And finally, to calculate the carbon-dioxide equivalent emissions (CO2eq), we use the GWP (Global Warming Potential) index.The sources for the conversion factors are:• Fuel price: Global Petrol Prices, (2020); Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy from the U.S. Department of Energy; Numbeo (2020). • Density: Engineering ToolBox (2020); CNMC, the National Commission of Markets and Competition; The National Energy Commission and the table of equivalences of SEDIGAS and GASNAM, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2013). • Lower calorific power: Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 2006 (Ch.1, Vol. 2). • Emission factors: Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 2006 (Ch.2, Vol. 2).The scope of countries included in this calculation are the following: Andorra, Angola, Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Czech Republic, Denmark, Ecuador, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Mongolia, Netherlands, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Norway, Oman, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, Uruguay and USA.GHG EMISSIONS FOR SCOPE 3Fuel and energy-related activities (not included in Scopes 1 or 2)The emissions not included in Scopes 1 or 2 relating to fuel and energy come from the emissions due to losses from the transport and distribution of the electricity, and those due to the value chain of the fuels and electricity.To calculate the emission factor of the losses in the transmission and distribution of electricity, we use the gross-production indicators for each country and the electricity transmission and distribution losses from Electricity Information (2020), published by the International Energy Agency (IEA). For the countries in which these indicators are not available, we use the indicators for their region.To calculate the emission factor associated with the electricity value chain by country, we use the following electricity-generation sources and their percentage of electricity generation on the total electric energy produced in each country: nuclear, hydroelectric, geothermal, solar, wind turbine, coal, oil, natural gas, biofuels, energy from waste and others (offshore wind farms, wave and tidal power, etc.), according to the Electricity Information (2020) report published by the IEA. For the countries in which these indicators are not available, we use the indicators for their region.For the aforementioned sources, we use the Well-to-Tank emission factors from the WELL-TO-TANK report Appendix 2 - Version 4a published by the European Commission to obtain the related CO2 emissions per kWh. As in some cases, the types of fuel used by the IEA do not coincide with those used by the European Commission; we select the data following these criteria:Oil: According to the International Energy Agency, within the Oil category there are the fossil fuels (Diesel oil, Petrol, Petroleum coke, etc.). In WELL-TO-TANK Appendix 2, we find the CO2 emissions of petrol and diesel oil on using them to generate electricity. We used the Diesel oil value as it is more restrictive.Other: According to the methodology of the International Energy Agency, the Other category encompasses processes that do not need fuel to produce energy; therefore, their emissions associated with the value chain are zero.The electricity-emissions factor is obtained using the electric-emissions factor for each of the countries included in the population, according to data from the IEA. For the countries in which the electricity-emissions factor is not available, we used the factor for their region.For the factor associated with the combustion of fuels, we use the Well-to-Tank factors contained in the WELL-TO-TANK report Appendix 2 (Version 4a) published by the European Commission. And for Biodiesel, we used the value of the POME process: Meal as AF, no CH4 rec., no-heat credit, glycerine-to-biogas to produce biodiesel as palm oil is the most used vegetable oil worldwide for producing biodiesel, and it is the most restrictive of the oils included in the related Appendix 2. As there is no factor associated with propane, and it is mainly extracted from natural gas, we used the natural-gas factor. Finally, for LPG we used the most restrictive one, the process LNG, road, vap.The factors associated with commuting: on the whole, to calculate both direct and indirect emissions, the reporting uses DEFRA’s “Conversion-Factors-2020-Full-set-for-advanced-users” guide. In the case of vehicles for which consumption is assumed to be 100% electric (i.e. electric cars, motorcycles and scooters, and underground rail networks), the reporting calculates conversion factors for distance/energy consumption from other sources because DEFRA does not publish this information.The countries included in the calculation of fuel and energy-related activities (not included in Scopes 1 or 2) are the same as those used to calculate Scope 1 and 2.Business travel by plane, train and taxiThe travel agencies through which we book travel provide us with CO2 emissions data per passenger, which are calculated based on the kilometres travelled, the occupancy of the aircraft (weight) and the type of aircraft, which are based on the rules set out by the UK’s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA).The scope of the countries included in the calculation is:  Angola, Australia, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Netherlands, Spain, United Kingdom and USA.With regards to the emissions generated during travel by taxi, Applus+ calculates the emissions of the journeys of our employees by using a taxi-management application. The emissions generated when travelling by taxi, requested through the application, are calculated based on the distance travelled and the fleet-emissions ratio, which is measured with the percentage of hybrid and electric cars operated in their fleet.The scope of the countries included in the calculation is: Spain. Employee commutingThe commuting emissions are related to the mode of transport used by our employees. The car, train, and bicycle, among others, are the vehicles taken into account to know our employees’ commute to the workplace.In 2019, the Group launched a global questionnaire to ascertain these mobility habits. The results allowed us to understand the different modes of transport used at each location where we operate.The emissions of each employee were calculated based on the mode of transport, the distance travelled and the number of days travelling per year, applying emission factors.Most of the factors used were published by DEFRA in the Conversion Factors 2020 Full set for advanced users document, both for calculating the direct emissions and for the indirect ones. In the case of vehicles of which the consumption is assumed to be 100% electric (electric car and motorbike, electric scooter and the underground railway), we used distance/energy consumption conversion factors from other sources since DEFRA does not provide this information.Due to the global crisis caused by the pandemic, to calculate our employees commuting we made an estimation by using the figures from 2019 and the number of total employees, excluding those who worked from home and therefore did not commute in 2020.The scope of the countries included in the calculation is:  Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Panama, Spain and USA.Bridge Inspection and Road Construction SurveyingGRI 102-55GENERAL CONTENTSGRI INDICATORDEFINITIONFINANCIAL AND NON-FINANCIAL INFORMATION REPORT 2020UN GLOBAL COMPACT101FoundationApproach to sustainability reporting102-1Name of the organisationApplus Services, S.A.Organisation’s profile and operational context102-2Activities, brands, products and servicesA+ at a glanceBusiness excellence.
