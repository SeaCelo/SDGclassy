Chapter 1. Introduction 
 
1.1. 	Structure of the report  
 
This report provides information on the progress and status of implementation of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Rwanda. It describes the Government of Rwanda’s efforts to mainstream SDGs into policy, strategies and programs at national and sub-national levels. This report is structured around four main chapters. The first chapter presents the country’s profile, the objectives, scope, methods and approach used to collect and analyze data for this review. The second chapter emphasizes policy environment and institutional arrangement to deliver SDGs. It specifically describes the SDGs ownership and domestication and what Rwanda is doing to ensure that no one is left behind. The third chapter highlights progress on SDGs implementation under five thematic areas as detailed in the scope of the review, while the fourth chapter presents the conclusions and key lessons learnt. 
 
1.2. 	Country Profile and Context 
 
The Republic of Rwanda is a landlocked country situated in Central and Eastern Africa, in the Great Lakes Region. Surrounded by the Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda, Tanzania and Burundi, it covers 26,338 Km2 of a very diverse landscape, ranging from dense equatorial forest on the volcanic slopes of the north-west of the country to tropical savannah in the east, along the Kagera river. Also known as the ‘Land of a thousand hills’, Rwanda is situated at an altitude ranging between 1,000 m above sea level in the eastern part to 4,500 m of the Karisimbi, the country’s highest mountain near the border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo. With an estimated population of about 12 million people (NISR, 2019 estimates), 52% of which are women, Rwanda has one of highest population densities in Africa (458.75/Km2). With over 40% of the population under the age of 30 (RPHC, 2012), Rwanda also boasts of one of the most youthful populations on the continent.  
 
The watershed in the history of independent Rwanda is 1994, when the Genocide against the Tutsis  took lives of more than a million people in mere three months and left the socioeconomic fabric of the country destroyed. Any account of the progress of the country in the past years cannot ignore the extent of the destruction and challenges brought by the bad governance leading to the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi and the national recovery effort that followed. The Post-genocide Rwanda sought to promote the security, welfare and dignity of citizens, harmonizing these values with modern principles of pluralistic democracy, human rights and equality as enshrined in the country’s constitution. Following the finalisation of the nationwide multi-stakeholder consultations, these values were enshrined in the Vision 2020, the country’s masterplan for the period 2000-2020. 
Rwanda pursued the Vision 2020 objectives through the successful implementation of mediumterm successive strategies; the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP I, 2002-2006) and the Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategies (EDPRS I and II, 2007-2012 and 20132018). In 2018, Rwanda started implementing its fourth medium-term strategy, the National Strategy for Transformation (NST1). NST1 is conceived as the bridge between the finalization of the Vision 2020 and the beginning of the Vision 2050, Rwanda’s roadmap towards becoming a high-income country.  
The results recorded since 2000, in terms of social and economic recovery and development have been impressive. GDP Per capita  more than tripled between 2000 and 2018, from USD 225 to USD 787. Poverty levels reduced at a fast pace falling from 60.4% to 38.2% between 2001 and 2017 and the country was able to reverse the trend in inequality levels that peaked in 2005 reaching 0.52 to then decrease to 0.429 in 2017. Similar achievements were scored in terms of human development, with the HDI value increasing more than 100% between 1990 and 2018, from 0.250 to 0.524 (UNDP, 2018).  
Rwanda has achieved all but one Millenium Development Goals, marking progression in several indicators such as life expectancy which increased from 49 to 67 years of age between 2000 and 2018, maternal and child mortality and access to affordable healthcare. The country also made significant gains in education, increasing the years of free education up to 12 and improving the enrolment rates for primary education. Whilst rebuilding its human capital, Rwanda has also massively invested in its infrastructure to sustain the fast pace of social and economic development and leveraged extensively on endogenous policy solutions. Also known as homegrown solutions, these policies are rooted in Rwandan culture and history and have proven to be well suited to respond to development challenges in a locally adapted way. Despite the registered achievements, the country still faces some challenges, including high poverty levels. Nutrition indicators are slow to improve, and particularly stunting levels remain high at 38% (DHS, 2015) hampering early childhood development and in turn affecting the learning outcomes.  
Nevertheless, a number of opportunities also exist and will be leveraged to achieve the desired socio-economic transformation. The youthful population (62% of Rwandans are under the age of 25 and 41% are under the age of 15, RPHC 2012) of the country will allow reaping the demographic dividend. The increasing integration in the global value chains, the investments in manufacturing, ICT, tourism and the active participation in regional integration initiatives at EAC and continental level (with the Africa Contitental Free Trade Area) will open new market opportunities. The continuous engagement in the international arena, supporting, shaping and championing regional and global agendas, such as Agenda 2063 and Agenda 2030 will help Rwanda achieve its ambitions and better position globally. 
The preparation and adoption of SDGs came at an opportune moment when the country started to develop its new long-term vision and medium-term plan (NST1) as well as related sector and district strategies. As such, the Agenda 2030 has been fully domesticated and integrated in the national planing framework. 
 
 
 
1.3. 	Objective of the review  
 
Rwanda volunteered to conduct and present for the first time its Voluntary National Review (VNR) report on implementation of the SDGs scheduled in July 2019 at the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development. This is in line with the country’s global commitment to carry out regular, voluntary and inclusive reviews of progress on the implementation of the Agenda 2030.  
  
More specifically, this review report provides: 
(i) SDGs domestication process and extent of integration in the national planning and development framework, including the integration of the principle of leaving no one behind, 
(ii) SDGs implementation progress and good practices,  
(iii) Challenges encountered and measures put in place to address them, 
(iv) Institutional capacities to coordinate and monitor as well as engagement of different stakeholders.  
This report also shares key innovations and lessons learned from SDGs integration and implementation process as well as areas requiring more support for taking forward the agenda 2030. 
1.4. 	Scope of the Review 
 
Rwanda’s VNR report is centered on the proposed 2019 global theme of "Empowering people and ensuring inclusiveness and equality” and is reflected throughout the document. This report provides an in-depth analysis of the seven SDGs (SDG 2, 4, 8, 10, 13, 16 & 17) proposed for the 2019 in-depth review across countries. The review is structured around five thematic areas, namely: (i) Human capital development (ii) Inclusive Economic Growth, (iii) Justice and Good Governance, (iv) Environment and Climate Change, (v) Strengthening the Means of Implementation, Global partnership and Data for SDGs. The report also covers other important components such as the principle of Leaving No One Behind and SDGs means of implementation. In addition, four more goals (SDG 1,3,5, and 9) are discussed. 
 
1.5. 	Methodology and Process  
 
Rwanda has established a steering committee for SDGs including, key Government Ministries and agencies, One UN, Development Partners (DPs), Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) represented by the Rwanda Civil Society Platform and the Private Sector Federation. In addition to overseeing the overall implementation of SDGs in Rwanda, the SDGs taskforce played a vital role in providing technical guidance and quality assurance during the VNR report preparation.  
Focal points across Ministries and Agencies were designated and tasked to provide necessary information from their respective sectors for the preparation of the review report. Details about the required data and processes for enabling an inclusive and participatory VNR preparation were provided in a kick-off meeting, bringing together representatives of all the planning departments from different ministries and agencies.  
The validation of indicators and data quality assurance followed a rigorous process, undergoing a series of validation steps by the various technical teams and later validated by permanent secretaries and Ministers.  
1.6. 	Data Collection 
 
Required information for this VNR were gathered through extensive desk review of all relevant documents such as Regional and National Visions, National Strategy for Transformation (NST1), Policy documents, budget and legal frameworks, Sectoral strategies, plans and programmes, District Development Strategies etc. Secondary data from existing surveys including the 
Integrated Households Living Conditions Surveys (EICVs), the Demographic and Health Survey 
(DHS), Labour Force Survey (LFS), Population and Housing Census, Sectorial Annual Statistical Reports and other relevant surveys were analyzed. In addition, an online survey questionnaire was completed by all relevant Government Ministries and Agencies, as well as Development Partners, CSOs and the private sector.  
Additional information and clarifications were obtained through consultative meetings and round table discussions with key sectors, especially with CSOs platform, the private sector federation and key sectors in Government including: social protection, environment and natural resources as well as governance among others. Furthermore, a series of stakeholder meetings were held to discuss and validate the fully contextualized list of SDGs indicators. Consultations with the CSOs were conducted during the drafting process of their position paper on SDGs.  
  	 
Chapter II. Policy Environment and Institutional arrangement  
 
2.1. 	Ownership of SDGs in Rwanda  
 
Rwanda is strongly committed to ensuring that SDGs are understood and owned both at national and local levels and across stakeholders. The Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MINECOFIN) is mandated to facilitate the ownership process at all levels of the national structures.  
 
The widely consultative process followed during the elaboration of the National Strategy for Transformation (NST1, 2017-2024), sectors and districts’ development strategies offered a unique opportunity to create SDGs ownership and awareness from central to local levels.   More specifically, an SDGs guide was prepared in English, translated in the local language (Kinyarwanda) and widely disseminated in hard copies and accessible online via the MINECOFIN website (www.minecofin.gov.rw). The National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda (NISR) has also launched an online SDGs portal containing latest data available on Rwanda SDG indicators (https://sustainabledevelopment-rwanda.github.io/sdg-indicators/2-2-1/). Furthermore, Rwanda SDGs METADATA handbook was developed, providing definitions and methodology among others, to ensure data sharing and reporting. 
 
Mainstreaming and creating SDGs awareness at different levels and amongst different stakeholders will however be a continuous process. Going forward, annual national planning and budget consultations will continue to deepen the ownership and awareness among wider stakeholders.  
2.2. 	SDGs Domestication in Rwanda 
  
The integration of the SDGs into the national development framework was guided by the Government of Rwanda’s domestication roadmap approved in December 2015. The process was consultative and informed by lessons learnt from MDGs, an initial SDGs gap and data readiness analysis and the review of the Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS 2) as well as 14 sector strategic plans. The gap analysis informed a detailed SDGs domestication plan and prioritization of new aspects brought by the adoption of the agenda 2030.  
The three SDGs dimensions, namely, Economic, Social and Environmental are comprehensively integrated in the NST1 pillars: “Economic Transformation, Social Transformation and Transformational Governance”. The strategy emphasizes the transformation principle across all the three pillars and resonates with the ambitious and integrated nature of the SDGs. Table1 below establishes the links between the NST1 priority areas and SDGs.

In addition to integrating SDGs into the national planning framework, specific goals are being and will continue to be integrated into sector policies and strategies. Some examples in selected areas are given below to showcase the integration of SDGs into national policies and strategies: 
 
• Ministry of Gender and Family Promotion is proactively engaging citizens on Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment issues. Gender Equality and women's empowerment is reflected in the Constitution of the Republic of Rwanda of 2003 revised in 2015 and in other gender sensitive laws that have been enacted. In terms of policy and programs, the National Gender Policy 2010 under review and its strategic plan (2016-2020) provide principal guidelines on which sectoral policies and programs should integrate gender issues in their respective political, social, cultural and economic planning and programming. As of now gender was mainstreamed into all 16 NST1 sector strategic plans, while among them 11 sectors have gender sector mainstreaming strategies.  Gender Equality promotion is also emphasized in District Development Strategies (DDSs) and Sector Strategic Plans (SSPs). For example, from January to May 2018, was a period for DDSs and SSPs development where technical assistance was provided to districts and Sectors for Gender mainstreaming as a cross cutting area of NST1.  
• Through HeForShe outreach campaigns, today, Rwanda is ranked 2nd globally with over 206,442 signups for both men and women committed to promote Gender Equality and Women's empowerment; Umugoroba w’Ababyeyi (parent's evening forum) – has also been used as a platform for promotion of Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment initiatives; Conduct annual advocacy & awareness raising dialogues & campaigns on women’s rights & Gender Based Violence (GBV) prevention through Governance and family welfare campaign, Gender accountability day among others; Furthermore, the introduction of Gender equality seal certification programme to enhance gender accountability in the private sector is another important initiative to promote SDG5.  
• In agriculture, the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal resources developed a new strategic plan for agriculture transformation (PSTA 4), which was approved by the Cabinet in June 2018 and is fully aligned to SDGs. As articulated in the strategy and captured in the results framework, the agriculture sector will contribute directly to SDG 2. The goal will be achieved through the successful implementation of the 4 priorities of PSTA 4: 1) Innovation and extension; 2) productivity and resilience; 3) inclusive markets and value addition; 4) enabling environment and responsive institutions. The agriculture sector will also contribute to the achievement of other SDGs, particularly: SDG 1 (end extreme poverty), SDG 8 (descent work and economic growth), SDG 12 (Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns), SDG 13 (climate action), and SDG 15 (terrestrial ecosystems, forests, and land). 
• The Justice sector responds to goal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to Justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels. To respond to this goal, the Ministry of Justice has recently adopted Justice Sector Strategic plan spanning from 2018 to 2024. This strategy aims at enhancing rule of law to promote accountable governance and a culture of peace for poverty reduction. In order to translate the interventions defined by sector strategic plan into the practical setting, each Justice Sector institution, including the Ministry of Justice are developing their own strategic plan, integrating SDGs indicators while also identifying strategic interventions necessary to deliver to the targets under the SDG16.  
• Education Sector Strategic Plan (ESSP 2018/19 to 2023/24) was elaborated guided by global, continental, regional and national planning commitments, for instance the SDGs. The central policy proposition for this ESSP is to ensure that Rwandan citizens have sufficient and appropriate competencies (skills, knowledge and attitudes) to drive the continued socio-economic development of the country. Key sector priorities include: Enhanced quality of learning outcomes, equitable opportunities for all Rwandans and more innovative and responsive research and development. 
Despite clear alignments between the national development strategies at central and district levels and SDGs, the domestication process in Rwanda still faces a number of challenges, including: 
− The gap between the ambition of the SDGs and available resources (both financial and human) calls for more consolidated efforts among stakeholders to increase resource mobilization and capacity development. 
 
− Until recently, there is lack of clarity in the methodology and measurement of some SDGs indicators. The ongoing updates of the global indicator framework will help to resolve this issue There is need for more investment and partnerships to further develop capacities to produce required data for effective monitoring of SDGs. 
In addition to the SDGs, NST1 also embraced the far-sighted, long-term continental and regional commitments. That is, the NST1 harmonizes the national development priorities and the African Union Agenda 2063 and its First 10-Year Implementation Plan 2014- 2023, which is dedicated to the building of an integrated, prosperous and peaceful Africa, driven by its own citizens and representing a dynamic force in the international arena. 
NST1 also incorporates the East African Community Vision 2050, which focuses on initiatives for job creation and employment by prioritizing development enablers which are integral to long-term transformation, value addition and acceleration of sustained growth. NST1 further aligns with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and other related agreements by treating environment and climate change as cross-cutting across all government interventions and sectors. 
2.3. 	Institutional mechanisms 
 
Rwanda has a strong and efficient institutional framework streamlining SDGs from national to local levels and involving a range of stakeholders. Table 2 below describes the institutional framework supporting the implementation of SDGs in Rwanda;

As part of efforts to reconstruct Rwanda and nurture a shared national identity, the Government of Rwanda drew on aspects of Rwandan culture and traditional practices to enrich and adapt its development programs to the country’s needs and context. The result is a set of Home-Grown Solutions - culturally owned practices translated into sustainable development programs. One of these Home-Grown Solutions is Imihigo or Performance Contracts. Imihigo is a planning, Monitoring and Evaluation tool used by the central and district levels to set delivery targets, assess progress 
-Imihigo (Performance Contract) Home -grown Solution) 
Imihigo is the plural Kinyarwanda word of Umuhigo, which means to vow to deliver. Imihigo also includes the concept of Guhiganwa, which means to compete among one another. Imihigo describes the pre-colonial cultural practice in Rwanda where an individual sets targets or goals to be achieved within a specific period of time. The person must complete these objectives by following guiding principles and be determined to overcome any possible challenges that arise. 
In 2000, a shift in the responsibilities of all levels of government as a result of a decentralization program required a new approach to planning, monitoring and evaluation. Local levels of government were now responsible for implementing development programs, which meant that the central government and people of Rwanda needed a way to ensure accountability. Currently, Imihigo covers both central and district levels. 
 

against agreed upon annual development targets, including SDGs.  
2.4. 	Leaving No One Behind 
 
The Government of Rwanda is strongly committed to promoting equality and equity amongst all categories of Rwandans by ensuring that socially and historically disadvantaged as well as vulnerable people are the main beneficiaries of its pro-poor programs. Article 16 of the Constitution of the Republic of Rwanda of 2003 with Amendments through 2015 stipulates that “All Rwandans are born and remain equal in rights and freedoms”, discrimination based on ethnic origin, skin colour or race, sex, economic categories, economic status, physical or mental disability…are prohibited and punishable by law”. In this regard, the Constitution guarantees representation in the parliament for special categories of Rwandans including youth, women, people with disabilities and the historically marginalized people. More specifically for women, the constitution of the Republic of Rwanda confers at least 30% of positions to women in all decision-making organs. Currently, Rwanda is a pioneer in promoting gender equality with the highest number of female parliamentarians in the world (61.3%). Other key positions occupied by women in selected organs are highlighted in the figure below.

Eliminating gender disparities in education has been an important priority for the education sector in Rwanda. In 2018, gender parity had been stabilized, with girl’s enrolment at 49.7% and 53.2% in primary and secondary levels respectively, while that of tertiary education was estimated at 42.6%. These remarkable gender outcomes in the education sector resulted from integrating gender equality and equity principles in the education policy and strategy as well as the adoption of a gender progressive education curriculum. Other positive gender related outcomes in the education include an increase in the female representation in ICT education from 32.3% in 2015/16 to 41.8% and a 46% increase of female students in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) from 43,770 in 2014 to 63,915 in 2018. 
In an effort to increase women’s employability skills, Rwanda has continuously strengthened demand driven Technical and Vocational Education Training (TVET) programs, increasing female enrolment from 41.8% in 2015 to 43.8% in 2018. Furthermore, measures have also been put in place to promote jobs creation for women and youth, including (i) the establishment of Business Development Fund with priority to women and youth (ii) the adoption of a strategy for women and youth access to finance (2016-2020) and (iii) empowering women in informal cross-border trade by building their capacities and helping them access finance and markets. 
Rwanda sees the role of the private sector and that of women entrepreneurs in particular, as vital for the country to achieve its long-term development objectives. In this context, the Rwanda Chamber of Women Entrepreneurs (RCWE) was established as an integral part of the Private Sector Federation (PSF). The RCWE dedicates efforts in improving the business climate and removing obstacles for women entrepreneurs to effectively play their role in the national development and job creation.  
Financing gender equality and empowerment of women has been and remains a priority for the Government of Rwanda. This is materialized by the Organic Law N° 12/2013/OL of 12/09/2013 on State Finances and Property that was adopted to enforce Gender Responsive Budgeting (GRB). Gender Budget Statement (GBS) is a mandatory annex to the budget framework paper by all budget agencies, allowing them to ensure that their formulated budgets incorporate a gender analysis that identifies the implications and impacts of the budget for both women and men.  
Rwanda has also put in place mechanisms for preventing and eliminating all forms of genderbased violence (GBV) and Child abuse. In this regard, Isange One Stop Centre was established in 2009 and later scaled-up in all district hospitals to provide timely and free of charge comprehensive services to victims of GBV and Child abuse. Furthermore, with regard to reproductive health, more women (53%) are taking own or shared (with their partners) decisions on the use of any contraceptive methods. 
In Rwanda, Youth is regarded as a dividend to drive an inclusive economic growth. The overall goal is to enhance growth and competitiveness of Rwanda’s youth and enabling them to contribute to Rwanda’s medium and long-term development goals. Job Creation is among Government of Rwanda’s key priorities. As such, a number of initiatives have been put in place to support youth entrepreneurship and job creation, including the establishment of the National Employment Program (NEP) focusing on strengthening youth entrepreneurship, access to finance, skills development and access to technology. Further, PSF has established a special chamber for youth – the Chamber of Young Entrepreneurs to support and facilitate youth entrepreneurship in doing business. Furthermore, in the recent Government restructuring, a standalone Ministry of youth was created. 
Improving the welfare of people with disabilities, indigents, elderly and other vulnerable groups is at the center of the Government of Rwanda’s interventions. Article 51 of the Constitution of the Republic of Rwanda; stipulates that the “State has the duty within its means, to undertake special actions aimed at improving the welfare of persons with disabilities, indigent, the elderly and other vulnerable groups”. In the context of inclusive education, the Government of Rwanda is committed to ensuring that people with disabilities have access to meaningful learning opportunities as provided by the Law No 71/2018 of 31/08/2018 relating to the protection of a child. Rwanda has also put measures in place to ensure that all public buildings such as schools, markets and administrative offices are built in a way that guarantees easy access for people with disabilities. 
In 2016, the Government of Rwanda conducted a nationwide categorization exercise for people with disabilities with the aim to classify people with disabilities based on their levels and types of disabilities and therefore design interventions and deliver services that fit the needs of each category of disabilities. 
The Government of Rwanda has since 2007 implemented the Vision 2020 Umurenge program 
– an integrated local development program to accelerate poverty eradication and social Protection. From its inception, the VUP program was made of three main components, namely, Public Works for people in Ubudehe category 1 and 2 (bottom two income categories) capable of working, the Direct Support for elderly, children headed households and people with disabilities who are unable to work and Financial Services for people willing to start small income generating activities. However, in 2017, a fourth component – the Expanded Public Works was introduced to provide consumption smoothing employment and promoting sustained graduation from extreme poverty among labour-constrained households, especially those caring for young children. In 2017/18, a total of 94,912 (29,531 males and 65,381 females) elderly and vulnerable people benefited from direct support for a budget of Frw12,867,647,5501. Beneficiaries of public works were estimated at 134,993 (66,489 males and 68,504 females) for an estimated budget of Frw 14,523,428,144. In 2018, the Government developed a new social protection policy that aims to ensure universal access to Social Security and Social Care Services for all Rwandans. Linked to this is the National Elderly Policy that currently is in process of validation. Furthermore, in order to address the issue of a limited proportion of Rwandan workforce covered by social security the Government of Rwanda has established the “Rwanda Long Term Saving Scheme (LTSS)”, known as “Ejo Heza” to give an opportunity to non-salaried workers who are currently excluded from formal pension and social security arrangements. 
To fully understand the current situation of vulnerable and marginalized groups, Rwanda conducted in 2018 the Multidimensional Poverty Index and Multiple Overlapping Deprivation Analysis of child poverty that will inform appropriate policy actions. These assessments look beyond income and provide an understanding of how vulnerable groups are being left behind across three key dimensions: health, education and standard of living. In 2018, the Government of Rwanda also conducted a profiling exercise for people living in extreme poverty (Ubudehe category 1 and 2), which led to the adoption of a National Strategy for the Eradication of Extreme Poverty which called for a multi-sectoral approach to supporting households to sustainably graduate from extreme poverty. 
In line with improving the welfare of the refugees’ community, Rwanda is also one of the pilot countries implementing the comprehensive refugees’ response framework for enabling socio-

economic inclusion of refugees. This is part of the Global Impact on Refugees that seeks to foster the resilience and self-reliance of refugees in a manner that also benefits host communities.  
This includes facilitating access to livelihood opportunities and services that empowering refugees to be less dependent on aid while giving them an opportunity to undertake income generating activities. Refugees in Rwanda are granted the right to work and the government has a policy of progressively integrating refugees into national system for health and education. More specifically, 19,000 Burundian refugees’ students have joined the Rwanda national school system. 
Areas of improvement for Leaving No One Behind 
Gender equality and women empowerment 
Despite remarkable progress as described above, a number of challenges still impede full attainment of Gender equality and empowerment of women in Rwanda, including: 
− Poverty among women: Female headed households (39.5%) are more likely to be poor than male headed households (37.6%) and adult women are more likely to be living in poverty (34.8%) than adult males (31.6%). − Limited control over productive resources: There is still need to ensure that more women in Rwanda have access to off-farm employment opportunities and increased control over productive resources to fully participate in the national development. − Gender Based Violence: More efforts are still required to ensure that women are freed from negative social norms and the culture of silence about GBV affecting timely reporting, prevention and effective legal assistance. Children with Disabilities  
− Standard Operating Procedures: There is still need for establishing Standard Operating Procedures at all centers caring for children with disabilities; 
− Capacity Development: There is need for a comprehensive capacity building program to address capacity need in the center caring for children with disabilities 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.5. 	National validation process 
 
The VNR report was validated through a four-step process. The first step of the validation consisted of a review of the first draft of the main report by directors of planning from different government ministries and agencies related to data and information concerning their respective sectors. The second step of the VNR report validation was through the SDGs Steering Committee (bringing together Government officials from different ministries, the development partners, civil society organizations and the private sector) and which mainly focused on quality assurance of the content. The third step of the validation was done by the forum of Permanent Secretaries followed by the approval of the final VNR report by Ministers.

As mentioned earlier, this review mainly provides an in-depth analysis of the six SDGs (SDGs 4, 8, 10, 13, 16 & 17) proposed for the 2019 in-depth review. However, the analysis also discussed other SDGs, namely SDGs 1, 2, 5 and 9 linking to the thematic areas analysis provided below. 
3.1. 	Human Capital Development  
 
3.1.1. Overview of Rwanda’ Human Capital Development Status 
 
 
 	Figure 2: Trends in Rwanda‘s HDI component Indices 
 	1990-2017 (UNDP, 2018) 
The Government of Rwanda has made significant progress in its Human Development Index (HDI) between 1990 and 2017, increasing HDI by 109.6% from 0.250 to 0.524. Rwanda’s life expectancy at birth increased by 18 years, from 49 years (2000) to 67 years (2018). The living standard of Rwandans increased by about 108.4% expressed in terms of GNI per capita, from USD 869 to USD 1,811 over 1990 to 2017.  
Similar progress has also been noted in the access to knowledge dimension with 	mean 	years 	of 	schooling increased by 2.3 years and expected 
years of schooling increased by 5.5 years in the same period (Figure 2). Nonetheless, Rwanda’s HDI value of 0.524 put the country in the low human development category. 
 
Furthermore, according to the 2018 World Bank Human Capital Index, positive trends have also been observed in most dimensions especially in the healthy life. However, Rwanda ranks in HCI 142 out of 157 countries. The HCI measures the amount of human capital that a child born today can expect to attain by age 18. Therefore, a child born in Rwanda today will be 37% as productive as s/he could be if s/he enjoyed complete education and full health. In this respect, Rwanda faces important challenges in chronic malnutrition with the under-five stunting of 38% (DHS 2015), early childhood development and quality education. The following sub-sections covers SDG 2 focusing on nutrition and food security, and provides an in-depth analysis on SDG 4 (as part of VNR proposed goal). 
 
 
3.1.2. SDG 2 – End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture 
 
Status and Trends 
Rwanda has developed comprehensive policies and strategies that contribute to ending hunger, achieve food security and improve nutrition.  It has been progressing steadily in its fight against hunger and malnourishment. Rwanda has put in place a monitoring process including conducting Comprehensive Food Security and Vulnerability Analysis (CFSVA), which was produced for the fifth time in 2018, to assess food security and vulnerability under the overall leadership of the National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda. The results of this CFSVA highlight the continuing positive trends from previous assessment since 2006. Rwanda has taken great strides in reducing poverty and malnutrition in the country. Agriculture, the main sector that contributes to the progress in improving food security has been growing on average by 6% over the last decade.. According to the CFSVA (2018) report, 81.3% of all households (about 2,034,942 households) are food secure (i.e., they are able to meet essential food and non-food needs without engaging in atypical coping strategies), have an acceptable diet, and use a low share of their budget to cover food needs.  
According to the 2014/15 Rwanda DHS, chronic malnutrition (stunting or low height for age) affects 38% of children under 5, reducing good health and affecting mental and developmental growth. Underweight (low weight for age) affects 9% of children under 5 while wasting, (acute malnutrition or low weight for height) which is associated with a high death rate, affects 2.2% of children under 5 (wasting rates <5% are considered within an acceptable range) (Figure 3).

Food access in Rwanda is mainly determined by seasonal patterns, commodity prices and people’s purchasing power. For instance, accessing adequate amounts of food becomes more complicated during the lean seasons. These periods are generally coupled with an increase in food prices, which in turn lead to food inflation, thus reducing a household’s purchasing power.  
According to the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) report of 2019, Rwanda scored of 6.1 in agricultural transformation. In addition, Rwanda was ranked the 2017 best performing country (AU, 2017) and is considered among those on track to fulfill the Malabo commitment by 2025 (as a part of the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program, CAADP).  
Rwanda’s agriculture is exposed to climate effects, such as droughts and floods, and crop yield levels are still below the potential levels, as indicated in figure 4.

Interventions and opportunities for accelerating progress 
Under the framework of the fourth Strategic Plan for Agriculture Transformation (PSTA-4), the Government of Rwanda’s priorities for agriculture include (i) irrigation (including small scale), (ii) Crop Intensification Program (CIP) focusing mainly on farmers’ access to agriculture inputs, extension services and land use consolidation, (iii) erosion control, and (iv) livestock development program. Furthermore, the Government of Rwanda has established an ICT platform–E-Soko, aiming at providing agricultural market pricing information to farmers, enabling them to make informed decisions. 
In addition, the Government of Rwanda recognizes the key role played by Women in the agriculture sector, producing for both home consumption and the market. The government of Rwanda has developed an agriculture gender mainstreaming strategy to guide the integration of gender in agriculture sector. Despite the high representation of women in the agriculture sector, challenges like more women still engaged in the production part of the value chain and less in agro-processing, marketing and export. This highlights the need to scale-up household based approaches that promote equitable household decision-making in regard to agriculture produce and other household resources. 
The current PSTA-4 considers that “accessibility of food will be enhanced through higher household incomes combined with greater resilience to market and production shocks.” 
Factors that influence food accessibility and resilience to production and market risks include improved storage capabilities, early warning and market information systems and insurance schemes. The new strategy recognizes that country-wide access to food will be achieved when all households have sufficient resources to obtain appropriate food (through production, purchase, and/or direct support under social protection) for a nutrient-rich diet. 
The government recognizes the urgency of protecting children from 0-6 years from the effect of poverty and its implications on human capital and has put in place a multi-sectoral programme, the National Early Childhood Development Programme (NECDP) (2016-2021). NECDP is set to eradicate child malnutrition and calls for all partners to work in a harmonized and integrated manner with the leadership of the Ministry of Gender and Family Promotion (MIGEPROF). The ECD policy and strategic plan have further been informed by and aligned to Vision 2020, Revised Family Policy, National Gender Policy and the National Integrated Child Rights Policy (ICRP).  
The Government of Rwanda in partnership with DPs provides regularly micronutrient powder (Ongera Intungamubiri) in all 30 districts to children aged 6-23 months and pregnant and lactating women in vulnerable households. The local Kinyarwanda name, Ongera Intungamubiri, which means “increase nutrients” is a powdered blend of 15 essential vitamins and minerals that can be added to semi-solid or mashed food just before the child eats. Packaged in single serving sachets, it allows families to fortify food for their young child with the safe and appropriate level of vitamins and minerals important for their growth and development. To widen its coverage the Fortified Blended Food (FBF) is also distributed to health facilities. In addition, milk is distributed to under 5 children with acute malnutrition. Moreover, the school feeding program, which aims at preventing and reducing malnutrition among School going Children in ECE & ECD are being strengthened. The One Cup of Milk per Child, which is run under the school feeding program, is preventing and reducing malnutrition among School goers. So far, 431,348 children were reached. This program is said to have boosted enrollment rate of children under 6 years. 
With regards to scaling up ECD interventions, to date 4,139 ECDs have been established including model ECDs Centers and community based ECDs such as the village kitchen –cooking demonstration kitchens through which parents, especially those with malnourished children are shown how to prepare balanced diet using locally produced food. 
Increasing the knowledge and the skill of Parents have been prioritized by the NECDP on the conviction that the family is the primary institution through which quality optimal care and early stimulation can be provided and as a result 15,000 parents have been trained nationwide. 
Furthermore, the knowledge and capacity of health care providers and community health workers on screening, growth monitoring and overall ECD, has improved. 
 
SDG 4 –Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote  
              lifelong public learning opportunities for all 
 
 
Status and Trends 
Rwanda has achieved significant success in providing universal access to primary education, with a net enrolment rate (NER) of 98.30% (MINEDUC, 2018).  In 2011, only two public pre-schools existed in Rwanda, today the country has 3,210 nursery schools. However, that enrolment in pre-primary education is still low but increasing. It was at 28.3% in 2017/18 (indicator 4.2.2).  On the other hand, with regard to assessing the number of children under 5 years who are developmentally on track (indicator 4.2.1) according to the 2014/15 DHS, 6 in 10 Rwandan children under the age 36-59 months (63 %) are set to be developmentally on track (i.e., on track in at least three of the four domains). 
When it comes to closing the gender gap in education (Indicator 4.5.1), there are approximately an equal number of boys and girls attending both pre-primary (Gender Parity Index (GPI) 1.02) and primary education (GPI, 0.98), showing gender parity at these levels (MINEDUC, 2018). On the other hand, there have consistently been slightly more girls than boys enrolled at secondary level, with girls increasing from 52.9% in 2016 to 53.2 % in 2018 compared to boys decreasing from 47.1% boys to 46.8% (MINEDUC, 2018). There are more girls than boys enrolled in all fields of upper secondary education (science, languages, humanities, teacher education), except technical secondary education, which has a higher rate of boys (MINEDUC, 2018) as shown in table 3.

The assessment of the learning achievements (indicator 4.1.1) in Rwandan schools for 2014 showed 45.3% of P2 students achieved the grade-level competency in literacy and 32.9% in numeracy (Table 5). There was no significant difference at P5, with 44.1% achieving literacy and 38.3% being competent in numeracy. Furthermore, the school completion and learning quality are low evidenced by learning test score of 358 on a scale where minimum attainment represents 300 and an average completion rate of only 3.8 years of school against a global average of 9 years (2018 WB, HCI).

At present, the Adult Literacy rate (indicator 4.6.1) is at 73.2% and the Numeracy rate is at 
73.4% (EICV5 -2016/17).  
The proportion of primary schools that are connected to electricity both on-grid and off-grid 
(indicator 4.a.1) has significantly increased from 52.4% in 2016 to 79.2 % in 2018 (MINEDUC 2018). Similarly, the proportion of secondary schools with access to electricity has increased from 65.2 % to 92.5% in the same year. Access to basic drinking water has improved from 45.5% to 53.6% in primary and 58.5% to 71.9% between 2016 and 2017. The ratio of toilet per users improved from 57 to 54 for primary students. The total number of toilets in secondary has increased to 37226 in 2018. This is an increase of 2,710 toilets built in 2017.  Furthermore, the proportion of primary and secondary schools having an Internet connection is 30 % and 52.9 % respectively (MINEDUC, 2018). It is estimated that about 21% of primary schools, 17.8% of secondary schools and 22.9% of TVET institutions have Smart Classrooms (MINEDUC, 2016).  
Interventions and opportunities for accelerating progress  
 
In order to address the underlying challenges in line with the Vision 2020 and fully integrating the SDG 4 focus on ensuring inclusive and equitable quality of education and learning, the Education Sector Strategic Plan (ESSP 2018-2024) is centered on: (i) increasing access to education programs, especially pre-primary enrolment; (ii) enhancing quality learning outcomes; (iii) enhancing use of ICT to transform teaching and learning; (iv) equitable opportunities for all Rwandan children and young people; (v) strengthening STEM across all levels of education; (vi) strengthened modern school infrastructure and facilities across all levels of education(vii) strengthening Continuing Professional Development (CPD) and management of teachers across all levels of education; (viii) More innovative and responsive research and development in relation to community challenges and (iv) Strengthened governance and accountability across all levels of education in Rwanda. 
 
Furthermore, numerous education-related policies and strategic plans have been developed or revised over the recent years to support the effective operationalization of the new ESSP and ultimately contributing to the achievement of the objectives of the NST1 and the SDGs. Among these are (i) Special Needs and Inclusive Education Policy (2017) and Strategic Plan (2018/192023/24),  (ii) Competence-based Curriculum Framework (2015), (iii) 9 years Basic education strategy(2008) extended to 12 years Basic Education Policy (2012), (iv) Adult Education policy , (v) Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) Policy (2015) and accompanying Strategic Plan (vi)Science, Technology and Innovation Policy (2005, reviewed in 2013/14 to also include a five-year strategic plan and (vii) the National Research and Innovation Fund managed by the National Council for Science and Technology (2018).  
 
In addition, the Government continues to steadily increase the budget allocated to the education sector. In 2017/18 the sector received an estimated budget of 241 billion Rwandan francs (RWF) and in 2018/19 the sector received 340 billion RWF, an increase of 41%. 
 
The introduction of the Competence-Based Curriculum over three years from 2016 is expected to meet the needs of a more diverse school population, rather than an academic elite, and has been designed to be responsive to the needs of the learners, society and the labour market. With a holistic, learner-centered approach, the curriculum demands major changes in teaching methodology and the use of a wider range of assessment techniques, including more of a focus on formative or ongoing continuous assessment. This has implications for all teacher trainings, and the necessary provision of support and guidance provided to schools to ensure the implementation.  
 
In addition, activities geared towards improving teachers training including in English language proficiency and numeracy skills are being implemented supported by innovative use of mobile phone technology as a tool for teacher development to deliver audio, video and text materials. Improving teacher management practices have also been prioritized which includes deployment, staffing norms, transfers, retention and incentive strategies (providing loan facility and increase of salary). 
Educating and training all vulnerable children and youths is gaining momentum in Rwanda. Nonetheless, the number of students with disabilities enrolled in all remains low. Similarly, trends are also observed in secondary school. To address all issues related to education and inclusion of all categories of disadvantaged learners, the Government of Rwanda has put in place strategies such as the development of the national inclusive education guide which is enabling schools to effectively implement inclusive education as a cross-cutting theme in the national curriculum. As a result, 2,528 teachers, one from each Rwandan public school have increased their capacity to implement inclusive education and deliver inclusive pedagogical approaches. 6,227 pre-service teachers (3,105 in 2018 and 3,122 in 2019) were trained on inclusive education and inclusive pedagogical approaches before starting their teaching career and being appointed to primary schools countrywide.

Enrolment of girls in STEM, digital fluency and literacy are being reinforced by innovative initiatives for STEM awareness campaigns like Teck Women, MISS GEEK, Techkobwa and WeCode programs. Furthermore, the Government has introduced scholarships targeting students pursuing STEM subjects especially for girls. Based on merit, full scholarships will be awarded to the identified needy students, and girls, to promote their enrolment in STEM programs in higher education. In addition, HEIs will increasingly specialize in STEM-related research and will support a range of school-based initiatives that promote STEM at an early age, identify and nurture students with special talents and incentivize performance through awards. 
 
Technology Engineering, Mathematics and ICT are the core GoR’s priorities for improving the relevance of education. An ICT in Education Policy (MINEDUC, 2016d) was adopted in 2016, which focuses on developing digital content aligned to the curriculum; increased ICT penetration and usage in education through ‘smart’ classrooms; the development of education leadership and training courses for teachers in and through ICT; and enhanced teaching, learning and research through ICT. In addition, an ICT center of excellence was established with the aim to build capacity of the workforce with highly sought skills and contribute to the national and regional development. 
The current ESSP is also targeting to strengthen the adult literacy programs and drive demand through an intensified awareness-raising campaign to re-engage communities and increase enrolment in literacy programs. Libraries and resources to provide reading materials for neoliterates to continue their learning and to develop literate environments will also be established in every sector. The professional competence of the existing teachers will be improved through appropriate CPD programs. Additional instructors will also be recruited and trained, to match the increased focus on adult education. 
Challenges  
 
Financing the rapid expansion of SMART classrooms, education infrastructure and needs will require significant investments and resources.  
 
 
3.2. 	Inclusive Economic Growth  
 
The inclusive economic growth thematic area describes the Rwanda’s performance in economic growth, employment creation (SDG 8) and reduction in inequality (SDG10). However, due to strong links between inequality and poverty, a highlight of SDG1 was also included in the analysis. 
 
 
 
3.2.1. SDG 8 Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all  
 
Status and trends 
Rwanda has scored sustained economic growth rates since the year 2000. Between then and 
2018, GDP grew at an average of 7.9% a year and GDP per capita increased from 225 USD in 2000 to 787 USD in 2018 (target 8.1/ Indicator 8.1.1). In 2018, Rwanda’s economy grew at 8.6% thanks to good performance of the Agriculture sector, which grew at 6%, industry, which grew at 10% (mainly due to high growth in construction and manufacturing sectors), and Services sector, which grew at 9%.   
The labour force surveys (LFSs) show that the unemployment rates have been decreasing for all categories. In fact, between 2016 and 2019, the overall unemployment rate decreased from 18.8% to 14.5%; male unemployment decreased from 15.7% to 13.8%, and female unemployment decreased from 22.7% to 15.4% over the same period. Youth unemployment remains higher than average, at 19.3% in 2019 (down from 21.5% in 2016). The overall labour force participation decreased from 54% in 2017 to 52.5% in 2019, with that of male decreasing from 62.7% to 61.9% and female from 46.4% to 44.2%.

Interventions and Opportunities for Accelerating Progress  
Ensuring that the sustained levels of growth are inclusive and sustainable and that the jobs created are quality jobs is the key challenge facing Rwanda on its journey towards upper middle and high-income status by 2035 and 2050 respectively.  Government estimates that to be able to reach these goals, Rwanda will have to grow at an average rate of 9% between 2017 and 2024 and then accelerate to at least 12% a year until 2035. The economy will have to generate 214,000 new jobs every year and private investment will need to grow from the current 14.4% of GDP to 21.2% by 2024 (figure 6). This entails a growing participation of the private sector in the economy, especially in those sectors with high job-creation potential to reduce the dependency of growth on public sector investments.  
Figure 6: Investment share of GDP (%)

The National Employment Program (NEP, 2014-2019) was established to cover a range of interventions focusing on empowering youth and women through entrepreneurship, access to finance such as the Business Development Fund that provides guarantee especially to women and youth, skills development and access to technology and employment services in partnership with private sector. In additional, employment gender mainstreaming strategy (2018-24) was developed to promote gender sensitive employment strategic actions aimed at bridging gender gaps in employment sector. Furthermore, in 2017, Rwanda launched the Private Sector Development and Youth Employment Strategy (PSDYES) for the 2018-2024, specifically targeting youth employment. The Government of Rwanda has also approved a number of policies and strategies aiming at promoting employment in Rwanda, including: the National Skills Development and Employment Promotion Strategy (2019), National Employment Policy and its implementation plan (2019) and the National Mobility Policy (2019). 
Rwanda is already setting up social safety nets for the informal sector (such as a long-term savings scheme that will function as a pension).  
Specific measures directed to increase female and youth employment such as Business Guarantee fund mainly supporting youth and women and NEP are also meant to promote the formalization of their businesses. 
The Government of Rwanda is also committed to improving the performance of key sectors linking to the intended socio-economic transformation. In agriculture sector, focus is put on continuous modernization of agriculture and ensuring access to subsidized inputs and quality extension services to all farmers for increasing productivity of agriculture and livestock. 
In order to harness the country’s efforts to reduce its trade deficit and upscale local manufacturing, the Government of Rwanda in partnership with private sector launched Made in Rwanda’ brand in 2015 and adopted made in Rwanda policy in 2018. The policy provides a holistic roadmap aimed at increasing competitiveness by enhancing Rwanda’s domestic market through value chain development, and increasing and diversifying Rwanda’s exports. Further, efforts will continue to be dedicated to constructing and developing industrial parks in provinces and expand the Kigali Special Economic Zone with capacity of 350 companies operating therein by 2024. 
Another strategic intervention will be the mobilization of the financial sector in increasing the availability of credit to the economy, leveraging on the growing levels of savings and on the comparatively high levels of financial inclusion. The integration of informal mechanisms into the formal financial sector, through the saving cooperatives and even the banks will be pursued to foster the financial intermediation capacity of the system and increase the availability of capital for investments.  
Challenges  
In order to ensure that the country’s aspirations for inclusive and sustainable growth as well as creation of descent and productive jobs are met, Rwanda will need to address the following challenges: 
− In order to meet its growth objectives, Rwanda will need to raise its domestic savings rate to at least 23% from current 10%. − Labour productivity (output per worker) is still low in Rwanda. While resources have increasingly moved from agriculture to other sectors, between 2001 and 2016, labour productivity either fell or rose only slightly across most sectors. − The private sector remains a relatively weak; it lacks the economies of scale that are crucial for productivity. The private sector also faces challenges related to high costs of finance and transport costs. − 
 
 The country still faces deficiencies in its human capital, and more investment is needed in this crucial area. 3.2.2. SDG 10 Reduce inequality within and among countries 
 
 
Status and Trends 
Rwanda has made significant strides in reducing inequality while concurrently reducing poverty.  Embedding the equality agenda at the heart of its national policies, Rwanda has put in place programs to ensure social mobility, address vulnerability and   enhance social   integration.  The development policies and programs pursued allowed for broad-based improvement in Rwandans’ well-being regardless of gender, origin, religion, and economic status. Inequality as measured by Gini Coefficient declined significantly over time. Based on 2016/17 household survey data, Gini coefficient declined from 0.522 in 2005 to 0.429 in 2016. Inequality manifests itself in geographical divide as well as by gender where female- headed households are still poorer at 39.5% compared to 37.6% of male-headed households (EICV-5 - 2016/17). The latest data confirms that inequality is highest in urban areas and lowest in rural areas. In terms of household income per capita using expenditure per adult equivalent (Target 10.1), income increased for the bottom two quintiles by 0.6 % and by 1.4 % respectively during 2014 and 2017, as shown in table 6. Thus, based on this data relative to the national average, the bottom 40% of the population in Rwanda has improved their income levels.

In terms of resource flows for development, Rwanda continues to receive significant resource flows (Indicator 10.B.1), while the mechanism of the delivery of such resources is changing over time.   
Remittances are important sources of supplementary income for low-income households, largely for consumption.  This   is   especially relevant for   Rwanda, as remittances have been increasing over time and accounted for 2.4 %  of GDP in 20171. Remittances inflows to Rwanda increased from USD 181.91 million in 2016/17 to USD 232.17 million in 2017/18. The growth in remittances is largely driven by the good performance of the global economy during this period, which enabled the transfer of resources from the diaspora to households in Rwanda. While progress has been made in reducing the cost of remittances globally and with the advent of new technology, the cost of sending money to Rwanda (Indicator 10.C.1 i), continued to be higher (4%) than the target by the UN which is less than 3%.  With Rwanda’s drive to continue to adopt new technologies and the entrance of mobile network operators (MNO) to the money transfer operators (MTO) market, the likelihoods are high for lower transaction costs to send money in the East Africa Region- including in Rwanda.  
Interventions and opportunities for accelerating progress   
Rwanda has taken bold and proactive approach to provide effective support to the   vulnerable. The country enhanced its effort to providing quality education, healthcare, and social protection services.  At the same time, it introduced more targeted assistance to vulnerable groups, such   as   the   lower-income and most vulnerable groups, including elderly, disabled, children, etc.   The implementation of the Vision 2020 Umurenge Program (VUP), targeting the most vulnerable Rwandans, has significantly contributed to reducing poverty and inequality. The table below provides the information on beneficiaries over the last five years.  
Table 7: VUP beneficiaries by Category 
  2013/14 2014/15 2015/16 2016/17 2017/18 Average/year              Males  Females  Number of HHs

The EICV5 report indicated that VUP has made significant contribution to improvement in households’ living conditions, with the direct support having a much higher impact. A change in the poverty in the VUP Panel between 2014 and 2017 indicates that poverty fell from 48.8% to 38.8% in the direct support households while extreme poverty was reduced from 24.1% to 
17.4% in the same category of households.   
In addition, since its inception in 2015 to 2018, the Minimum Package for Graduation (MPG) program has benefited a total number of 19,489 households, who are composed of 18,027 under VUP (13,132 PW and 4,895 DS) and 1,365 from FARG Direct Support and RDRC Direct Support respectively. Among households benefitting from MPG, female-headed households represent 55%, while male-headed households represent 45%. The composition of the targeted beneficiaries was as follows: PW beneficiaries make up 67.4 %; 25.12% VUP DS; 7% FARG DS and 0.5% RDRC DS of all the program beneficiaries.   
Regarding strengthening social protection in Rwanda, the Government of Rwanda is currently revising the social protection policy in order to accelerate graduation from poverty.  
The Social Protection Sector Strategy (2018-24) is currently being implemented and aims at addressing some of the life cycle shocks such as age and disability. The strategy further puts in place interventions such as Expanded Public Works that targets moderately labour-constrained households (e.g. single worker households caring for young children) and, by providing reliable year-round employment, which also is expected to have greater impact on poverty and malnutrition. Another key policy reform has been the introduction of nutrition sensitive direct support, which targets pregnant mothers and children under two as a mechanism of addressing stunting.    
In 2018, Rwanda has adopted a new law regulating labour, addressing some inequalities at work place such as (i) the minimum wage in categories of occupations determined by an order of the Minister in charge of labour, (ii) protection against workplace discrimination, (iii) protection from forced labour, (iv) prohibited forms of work for the child, pregnant or breastfeeding woman. 
 
Challenges  
Despite Rwanda’s reduction in poverty and achievements about human development indicators, much scope remains to reduce income inequality and address regional disparities as well as gender disparities. Rwanda has a very comprehensive policy framework to address inequalities, however the scale of implementation of these policies requires huge resources.. Rwanda will continue to make growth inclusive, as the structural transformation process deepens. The country will require to further mobilize the necessary resources, both human and financial, to enhance the impact of the existing social protection policies as well as to invest on human development, leveraging also on its fiscal policies.  
Rwanda’s drive to self-reliance combined with the support of partners to strengthen its capacity, is yielding significant result. Increasingly the country is financing its own development through domestic resources. However, in the context of declining ODA, increasing domestic resource mobilization will be critical. Rwanda’s unwavering effort to attract private capital through foreign direct investment and increased facilitation by using innovative financing options such as blended finance requires further partnerships.  
 
	3.3. 	Climate Change 
 
SDG 13Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts 
 
 
Status and Trends 
The Government of Rwanda (GoR) is among the countries, which have ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and one among the first countries to sign and ratify the Paris Agreement COP21 as well as the Kigali amendment to the Montreal protocol. This demonstrates its willingness, being a responsible member of the global community, to seek and achieve global solutions on climate change.  
Climate change is expected to result in increased temperatures, intensified rainfall, and prolonged dry seasons. Temperatures have increased by 1.4°C between 1970 and 2010 and may further increase by up to 2.5°C by 2050 (from 1970 levels) and by 1-6°C by 2100. The average annual rainfall is expected to increase by 20% by 2050 from the 1970 levels.  
 
Rwanda’s strong reliance on rain-fed agriculture both for livelihoods and exports translates into vulnerability to climate change. An evaluation of social vulnerability conducted in 2011 to climate change ranks Rwanda first among all African countries in terms of natural resource dependency, which it considers to be one of three indicators for social vulnerability to climate change.  
 
The analysis of rainfall trends shows that rainy seasons are becoming shorter and more intense, especially in the northern and western provinces, increasing erosion risks in these mountainous parts of the country. The Eastern region has experienced serious rainfall deficits in a number of years over previous decades, alternated with rainfall excesses in other years. As noted in the National Green Growth and Climate Resilience Strategy, the cost of climate change in Rwanda was estimated at 1% of GDP per year by 2030. 
 
Some climate change effects, such as severe droughts and floods, famine, population displacement, the lowering level of lakes and water flows, forest degradation and biodiversity loss are expected to occur more frequently. In the past three years, Rwanda has experienced a series of disasters that have killed hundreds and wounded many Rwandans and damaged basic infrastructures and crops as detailed below.  
 
 
Table 8: Disaster effects in Rwanda (2016-2018)

The 2018 Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) shows that about 2,730,554 people were affected and 31,580 temporarily displaced in 15 districts (Table 8). The PDNA also revealed that the total damage and loss in 2018 was estimated at US$ 236 million, and the total cost of recovery and reconstruction- at US$ 336 million. 
 
Interventions and opportunities for accelerating progress 
Rwanda ratified the Kigali amendment to the Montreal protocol, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Rwanda also submitted its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to UNFCCC and developed NDC Partnership with key identified priorities to fast-track implementation. To supplement existing efforts in protecting the environment, the Rwandan parliament also adopted a law in June 2019 to ban single use plastics and encourage more recycling. 
Rwanda’s vision is to become a developed, climate resilient and low carbon economy by 2050. An initial stage towards the vision has been the development and implementation of the first Green Growth and Climate Resilience Strategy (GGCRS) which focuses on: (i) achieving energy security and a low carbon energy supply that supports the development of green industry and services, (ii)  achieving sustainable land use and water resource management that results in food security, appropriate urban development and preservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services and (iii)  achieving social protection and disaster risk reduction in order to reduce vulnerability to climate change impacts. The Government of Rwanda also recently approved a Revised National Environment and Climate Change Policy (2019) and the Revised National Land Policy (2019) that aim at emphasizing on greening economic transformation, enhancing functional natural ecosystems and managing biosafety and promoting climate change adaptation, mitigation and response among others. The Government further approved the Revised National Land Policy (2019) aiming at strengthening land administration and management to ensure optimal allocation and use of land. More specifically, the revised land policy addresses the existing gaps in the land use planning and mapping, land utilization by various sectors as well as in land administration and management. . 
Environment and climate change remains one of the cross-cutting areas in the national development framework and is mainstreamed in sector specific strategies and districts’ strategies, plans and Imihigo (performance contracts).  
Rwanda is strongly committed to strengthening its climate change resilience and adaptation capacity as manifested through the establishment of policies and strategies related to disaster management. The National Disaster Management Policy was adopted in 2012, providing an overarching framework for decision-making and coordination across disaster management sectors and actors, including government ministries, civil society organizations, international organizations and the private sector. A Disaster Management Plan to implement the policy was developed in 2013. The Ministerial Order No.011/MIDIMAR/2012 of 24/05/2013 determining construction modalities for preventing disaster caused by thunderstorms, rain and windstorms and the Prime Minister’s Instruction No.001/3 of 11/7/2014 are some of the legal instruments used in disaster reduction and management in Rwanda. Other policies and strategies linked to disaster management adopted by the Government of Rwanda include the National Housing Policy (2015), Green Growth and Resilience Strategy (2011), the National Food and Nutrition Policy (2014), the National Urbanization Policy (2015) and the National Land Policy (2018). 
The National Environment and Climate Change Policy adopted in 2019 reiterates government commitments to promote: 
− A green economy that is resource efficient, low-carbon and climate resilient,  − A circular economy to advance sustainable consumption and production patterns,  − Green technologies and procurement,  − Green urbanization and green rural settlements, and − Green mobility.  
In order to sustain progress and strengthen national capacities for disaster management, NST1 focuses on: (i) strengthening capacities for weather forecasting and early warning systems to increase reliability and accuracy of information for informed decision making, (ii) improving coordination and engagement of all stakeholders to enhance information sharing, timely response and joint delivery of interventions; and (iii) continuing implementation of the disaster management plans and tools including district disaster management plans and other contingency plans. 
 
Other Government Initiatives  
FONERWA 
The National Climate and Environment Fund (FONERWA), was created in the 2012 to respond to Rwanda’s current and future needs for environment and climate change related financing, to further support and accelerate goals of sustainable economic development. The creation of FONERWA was recommended by the environmental law of 2005. Furthermore, law nº 39/2017 of 16/08/2017 establishing the national fund for environment and determining its mission, organization and functioning was enacted.  
Since its establishment, investment by FONERWA have resulted in creation of green jobs, areas of land protected against soil erosion, households with improved access to off-grid clean energy and more funds mobilized in strategic climate resilience investments among others as summarized in Table 9 below; 
Table 9: FONERWA key achievements

Some of the successful development projects funded by FONERWA include: (i) Public-Private Partnership on electronic waste management, implemented in partnership with the Ministry of Trade and Industry to establish an e-waste recycling facility, (ii) Zero carbon affordable housing project aiming at developing flexible single and multi-storied housing solutions that can be prefabricated, mass-produced and constructed in a way that satisfies the low carbon demands of the GGCRS and (iii) Rice husk power generation technology converting  and producing 70 Kw from biomass (rice husks) into electricity.  
Guideline on Gender in Disaster Management 
The guideline aims to provide the Ministry in charge of disaster management and its main partners with guidance concerning gender analysis, planning and actions to ensure that the needs, contributions and capacities of women, girls, men and boys are considered in all aspects of disaster management and disaster risk reduction processes. 
The guidelines focus on major cross-cutting issues in all phases of disaster management, including preparedness, response and recovery. The guidelines offer a useful tool to make sure gender issues are included in needs assessments, vulnerability and capacity analysis, contingency planning and evaluations.  
Natural Capital Accounting Initiative 
Rwanda was one of the first African countries to sign the Gaborone Declaration in 2012 announcing its need to apply Natural Capital Accounting (NCA) as a tool to inform national policies on sustainable development. Currently, the NCA informs the planning processes for different strategies and policies by considering the important contribution of natural resources sectors in the economy. In 2013, Rwanda also joined the WAVES (Wealth Accounting and the Valuation of Ecosystem Services) global partnership to support its NCA efforts. 
Environmental Impact Assessment  
The Organic law No. 04/2005 of 08/04/2005 determining the modalities of protection, conservation and promotion of the environment in Rwanda and law N°48/2018 of 13/08/2018 on environment made Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) mandatory for approval of major development projects, activities and programs in the Republic of Rwanda. A full list types of of projects requiring EIA is provided in the 2009 Ministerial order relating to the above law. In 2006, the Government issued the general guidelines and procedure for environment impact assessment in Rwanda. The guidelines are meant to: 
− Enable the incorporation of environmental considerations in design and site selection for projects or development activities; − Enhance responsibilities of relevant parties in the development process; − Mitigate and minimize environmental damage; − Avoid costs and delays in implementation of projects that would arise from unanticipated environmental problems; − Make development projects more financially and economically efficient; − Make an active contribution to sustainable development.\  
The National Risk Atlas of Rwanda 
The Government of Rwanda produced the National Risk Atlas of Rwanda (NRAR) in 2015 with the main objective of conducting a comprehensive and nationwide assessment of the existing risks in order to develop a comprehensive disaster risk profiles for Rwanda. The NRAR covers five main hazards mostly impacting Rwanda namely: droughts, floods, landslides, earthquakes and windstorms, selected based on their negative socioeconomic impacts on the development of Rwanda. The NRAR forms a basis for decision making and mainstreaming disaster risk reduction in the Government´s sectoral planning process. 
 
 
Result Based Monitoring Framework for the Environment Natural Resources (ENR) sector 
As part of effective monitoring and evaluation mechanism of SDGs ENR related indicators, the Ministry of Environment initiated and implemented a web-based results monitoring system to enhance cross-sectoral coordination and track progress of the implementation.  
Challenges  
Rwanda faces a number of persisting challenges in managing disasters in Rwanda including:  
Land scape and settlement: The landscape and the settlement in high risk zones put the population at high risk of landslide and flooding 
Disaster Risk Management Capacities: Institutional capacities for disaster risk management needs to be strengthened. 
High cost of disaster mitigation and disaster management:  Current settlement in high risk zones requires huge financial resources to relocate the population to new sites, and to restore the previously occupied zones.  
   
3.4. 	Governance and Justice for all  
 
 
SDG16 Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels 
 
Status and trends 
Over the last two decades, Rwanda has spearheaded governance reforms to consolidate peace, build strong and accountable public institutions and create a safe, stable environment conducive to investment and growth. Rwanda’s experience of deploying Home-Grown Solutions (HGS) 

to address governance and development challenges has been a bedrock of the Rwandan reconstruction and transformation journey. The HGS approach provides a continued significant opportunity to develop sustainable solutions to development challenges, as it combines the elements of culturally owned 
Rwanda Governance Scorecard (RGS) 
 
The RGS is a home-grown quantifiable instrument that monitors the progress of governance in the country. It places global governance 
standards and home-grown indicators at the center of its method which makes it 
uniquely relevant to both the international and national contexts 

historical practices and the innovative element of effectively adapting them to current contexts. 
According to the 5th edition of the Rwanda Governance Scorecard (RGS 2018), the safety and security performance indicators have been steadily increasing, scoring 94.97% in terms of being trusted by citizens. Rwanda’s investment in reconciliation and social healing has made the related indicator increase substantially from 80.58% in 2014 to 93.95% in 2018 (RGS 2014-16).  
 
In addition, Rwanda has developed a National Action Plan (NAP) 2009-2012 and 2018-2022 to implement the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 (UNSCR 1325) on women peace and security, as a practical step to sustain and expand registered gains in the women, peace and security agenda. 
The Gallup’s Law and Order Index 2018, which gauges people’s sense of personal security and their personal experiences with crime and law enforcement in Rwanda indicated that 83% of Rwandan residents have confidence in the local police force and that they feel safe walking alone at night positioning Rwanda as the second safest place in Africa2.. Access to justice has been subject to a decline followed by a stable rating since 2014 (80.25%) to 76.4% in 2016 and 77% in 2018. However, the overall pillar of rule of law (including access to justice) recorded a sharp increase from 67.7% in the 1st edition of the RGS (2010) to 84.5% in 2018 (RGS).  
The 2018 Corruption Perceptions Index by Transparency International rated Rwanda as the 48th least corrupt nation globally, 4th in Africa, and the 1st in East Africa.  
Although consistently increasing over time, the quality of service delivery pillar remains the least performing pillar in the Rwanda Governance Scorecard over time. Service delivery in local administration increased significantly from 71.1% in 2014 to 85.6% in 2018.  
The level of citizen satisfaction with their participation in decision-making processes is at 45.5% (Citizen Report Card, (CRC), 2017). Satisfaction with participation in the elaboration of district budgets and plans is 47.7% (CRC, 2017).  Vibrancy of Civil Society Organizations in Policy formulation increased from 59.7% in 2014 to 67.33% in 2018 (RGS, 2018). 
A lot of progress has been recorded in birth registration both in terms of the legal and policy framework but also in terms of building capacities and raising awareness for increased birth registration in Rwanda. The Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) development was a central focus under the previous National Strategy for the Development Statistics, with significant successes on piloting the web- based CRVS registration system. These together with the shift from paper-based to web-based birth registration will increase birth registration from 56% in 2015 (DHS 2014-2015) to 89% (CRVS 2019). 
Rwanda has put in place appropriate legislation and policies to guarantee access to public information. Additionally, media reform laws initiated in 2013 has helped strengthen media autonomy, including by establishing a media self-regulatory body. Access to public information increased from 76.5% in 2014 to 84.86% in 2018 (RGS).  
The National Human Rights Commission of Rwanda was created under the Law n° 04/99 of 12th March 1999 which was then replaced by the Law n° 30/2007 of 6th July 2007 determining the organization and functioning of the National Commission for Human Rights based on the Constitution of the Republic of Rwanda of 4th June 2003 as amended to date. Recently, so as to comply with the Paris Principles, the Law was replaced by Law n° 19/2013 of 25/03/2013. According to the last accreditation status document released in October 2018, the Rwanda National Commission for Human Rights was accredited with "A" status by the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) 
 
Interventions and opportunities for accelerating progress 
The JRLO sector outcome emphasizes improving universal access to quality justice through the following key interventions: (a) Modernize the criminal, commercial, civil and administrative system, (b) Promote legal aid for Universal access to affordable and quality justice, (c) Improve access to quality justice for vulnerable people, and (d) Timely execute all judgments and enforceable decisions. In this respect, the judicial system is undertaking various reforms and innovations to further promote equity, fairness, transparency and accountability across institutions and individuals. These key reforms are set to reduce the rate of backlogs cases especially for supreme court to below 10% by 2024. 
 
                                The IECMS was developed by the Government of Rwanda as one of the This improvement in the remedies towards reducing delays and transaction costs associated justice sector was partly with judicial cases and generally to improve the provision of access to justice through the entire justice chain from Investigation to Correctional

The provision of Legal AID service through the Maison d’Accèss à la Justice (MAJ) services and Abunzi (Conciliators) committees at local level have improved access to universal, quality and affordable justice. MAJ Staff based at district level facilitate access to legal aid activity at district level and the decentralized outreach activities at the administrative sector level to facilitate the population, including vulnerable group, to have access to quality and affordable justice.  At the community level, there is ABUNZI committees that facilitate in Alternative Disputes Resolution (ADR) mechanisms and they provide free service to the beneficiaries through the Government (JRLOs) support. In this regard, 72.1% of the citizens have expressed their satisfaction with Access to Justice Bureau   or “Maison d’Accès à la Justice” (MAJ) activities; while those appreciating the work done by Abunzi have increased from 76% (RGS Report 2014) to 79% (RGS Report 2016). 
 
Furthermore, according to the State of Gender Equality Gender Report (2019) and Beijing +25 Rwanda Country Report (2019), at the grass root level, women are playing a visible role in conflict management and justice structures. They represent 44.3% of community mediators (Abunzi) and 48% of the access to Justice Bureaus (MAJ). They also contribute to providing free legal services to citizens, including victims of GBV and child abuse. Women in security organs actively participate in peace building initiatives at both regional and international levels. In 2015, Rwanda was the second highest contributor of female police peace-keepers. This sends a positive message to the communities especially on the capacities and professionalism of women in peace and security affairs.

Challenges  
Media availability and access to information for citizens is still low at 65.8%, although increased from 55.2% in 2013(Rwanda Media Barometer 2013 and 2016). Limited profitability of the media sector, poor retention of best journalists, lack of media capacity building and lack of journalists' commitment to media professional codes of conduct have been cited by the Rwanda media barometer as being major challenges to media sector development in Rwanda. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
	3.5. 	Global partnership and Data for SDGs 
 
 SDG 17Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development 
 
Status and Trends 
 
Rwanda has for long time recognized the importance of effective partnerships for sustainable development. It has not only created inclusive partnerships that delivered visible changes on the ground, but has also proactively taken leadership role to promote such partnerships within the region and beyond. At country level, partnerships between governments, the private sector and civil society as well as development partners are thoughtfully created to foster development in the country based on its medium-term plan and long-term Vision. With the drawing up of the most ambitious transformation plan- NST I, anchored on Vision 2050; Rwanda more than any time ever, emphasized the very important role of the private sector beyond traditional partnerships in the decades to come. It is proactively pursuing innovative partnership with development partners to move beyond traditional financing and consider new and innovative ways to finance the private sector. The country has pursued relentlessly self-reliance approach that is yielding significant results, while leveraging effective partnerships.  These inclusive and innovative partnerships are built and guided by international principles as well as national vision. The country has development aid policy, which was recently revised in 2018.  
Rwanda has developed policies that guide its domestic resource mobilization effort, including through introducing new excise and royalty taxes as well as revenue administration measures to increase compliance. While broadly the country registered encouraging results (Indicator 17.1.1), total government revenue as a proportion of GDP, reaching a peak of 24.1 % in 2017/18. Rwanda recognizes the need to enhance domestic resource mobilization and sustain progress in the medium and long term.  
Further to mobilizing resources, Rwanda continued to implement its policy of self-reliance by financing large share of its budget from domestic resources (Indicator 17.1.2).  The proportion of domestic budget funded by domestic taxes and loans increased from 55% in 2005 to 84% in 2018/19. On the other hand, the share of external grants to finance budget declined from a high of 44.3% in 2005 to 16% in 2017/18.  This effort was complemented by aid policy that encouraged partners to effectively support Rwanda by using country system to disburse money as well as report its progress using country own result frameworks.  In the use of country systems, 78.0% of ODA disbursements were delivered by GoR agencies in 2017/18, slightly higher than 2016/17 (73.0%), and 71.1% of ODA disbursements used public financial management and procurement systems in 2017/18, also slightly higher than in 2016/17 (66.3%). The overall use of country results frameworks in development co-operation (Indicator 17.15.1), is 67.5%, which reflects potential for improvement in the short and medium terms3. This trend is extremely important for a country to be able to sustainably finance its own development and to avoid fragmentation and duplication of efforts. 
Figure 7: Fiscal trends  
 
 
Furthering its domestic resource mobilization efforts, Rwanda is encouraging its citizens living abroad to contribute to their national development process (Indicator 17.3.2). As a result, the volume of remittances (in United States dollars) as a proportion of total GDP continued to increase, despite the global economic uncertainties. Remittances have reached a peak of above 3 percent of GDP before financial crisis of 2008.

As a result of prudent macro-economic management and sustained effort to mobilize resources, Rwanda maintained stable and healthy debt levels (Indicator 17.4.1).  Debt service as a proportion of exports of goods and services remained below 4% as at 2017.  With prudent borrowing for investment, sustainable debt levels have been maintained. Present Value of debt to GDP in 2019 stands at 30%.  
To strengthen the south-south cooperation, the Government of Rwanda established and operationalized a private company, the Rwanda Cooperation Initiative in September 2018 whose mandate is to promote Home Grown solutions and coordinate peer learning related to country experiences and progress in areas such as doing business reforms, public finance management, unity and reconciliation and strengthening governance systems, among others.  
 
Data for SDGs monitoring and Reporting  
The 3rd National Strategy for the Development of Statistics, NSDS3 is Rwanda’s first NSDS designed for alignment with the SDG agenda, leveraging the global mandate to expand data supply, mobilize resources and strengthen the National Statistical Systems. Objectives to improve coverage, frequency and granularity in data production — and for other key initiatives outlined in this chapter — are motivated by a nationally-led and owned approach to SDG monitoring and reporting. The National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda (NISR) led an extensive consultative process under NSDS 2 to develop an official national list of SDG indicators. As a result, during NSDS 3 implementation, the NSS will aim to fulfill all relevant SDG indicator requirements for a total of 150 priority indicators assigned to NST1 sectors. To implement a national approach to SDG measurement, NSDS 3 will operationalize the 6 strategic areas outlined in the Cape Town Action Plan in the Rwandan context: 
Strategic Area 1: Coordination and strategic leadership on data for sustainable development. Rwanda pursued a strategy of early intervention to respond to emerging SDG data requirements. NISR assumed a lead role in this process, identifying where indicators were fully, partially, or not currently reflected in official statistics.  
Strategic Area 2: Innovation and modernization of national statistical systems. The launch of the DRP (Section 3.4) and improvements in statistical governance (Section 3.7.3) are strongly tied to the 2030 Agenda, providing frameworks to expand data access, facilitate dialogue and introduce the NSS to new data, technologies and techniques.  
Strategic Area 3: Strengthening of basic statistical activities and programs, with a particular focus on the monitoring needs of the 2030 Agenda. NISR adopted a proactive approach to SDG measurement, adapting key surveys to close SDG data gaps during NSDS 2. With over 40% of indicators linked to administrative sources (Abdella, 2017), the SDGs also motivate the design of sector statistical plans (Section 3.2).  
Strategic Area 4: Dissemination and use of sustainable development data in addition to ongoing efforts to improve data dissemination at NISR (Section 3.6), the development of the NDP and a specialized SDG reporting platform under the DRP (Box 4) will make SDG data and evidence more accessible to decision-makers and the public.  
Strategic Area 5: Multi-stakeholder partnerships for sustainable development data: Rwanda’s decentralized approach to SDG monitoring provides an opportunity to strengthen sector ownership in data production and plans for DRP implementation open new partnerships with NSOs, academia and the private sector.  
Strategic Area 6: Mobilize resources and coordinate efforts for statistical capacity building. The new NISR Training Center (Section 3.5) will be the central hub of DRP implementation and a comprehensive capacity building program. The facility positions NISR to lead efforts to modernize the NSS and equip MDAs to measure national progress toward the SDGs. 
Meeting the SDGs data demand requires to also foster a more innovative approach in addition to strengthening traditional data source. Hence, In April 2017, the GoR released an innovative policy designed to facilitate a national data revolution, designating NISR as the lead implementing institution. The DRP (FY2017/18- FY2021/22) aims to 'build an innovation [and] data-enabled industry to harness rapid social and economic development' (The Republic of Rwanda, 2017). As declared during the 5th UN International Conference on Big Data for Official Statistics, which took in Kigali from 29th April to 3rd May 2019, The Government of Rwanda has offered to host a hub of the UN Global Platform in Rwanda at the National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda 
Training Centre and Data Science Campus. The hub will support capability development work of international and regional agencies in Africa in Big Data for official statistics and respond to SDG data needs.  
Rwanda is also hosting the SDG Centre for Africa (SDGC/A) in support of continental efforts to deliver on the SDGs. The Centre has been publishing the Africa SDG Index and Dashboards Report since 2017. Relatedly, the Center has designed and developed an SDG Monitoring and Reporting (MR) system to be rolled out in African countries. Furthermore, numerous assessment and studies have also been commissioned by the center including specific case studies for African countries, and SDG costing estimates for Education and health sector found in the Center’s 2017 Africa 2030 report. 
The Center is also involved a wide ranging set of other initiatives inter alia to harmonization of monitoring systems for both 2030 agenda and the AU 2063 agenda, development initiatives for financing in part through reforming National Development Banks and carrying out tax reforms, enhancing the quality of tertiary education (has prepared and started implementing the road map for Kigali initiative which aims to transform at least 25 universities in Africa), designing an Accountability Framework for Health Systems in Africa,  De-carbonization Pathways Project for Africa and Enhancing Adaptation and Resilience to Climate Change in Africa. 
 
Interventions and opportunities to accelerating progress 
Vision 2050 and NST 1 lay the foundation to help meet the SDGs and propel Rwanda to middleincome and to high-income status over the longer term. However, available resources fall far short of what will be needed to realize the longer-term development objectives. Fiscal discipline has been complemented by efforts to bolster domestic revenue mobilization and improve fiscal transparency, but there is ample scope for additional progress. Furthermore, Weak domestic saving is a constraint on the domestic capacity to generate financing for private sector investment. Low mobilization of domestic savings at 10% of GDP in 2018 is a concern. It is well below the target of 22.8% of GDP projected for 2024, a level consistent with domestic savings rates in successful emerging economies. In terms of enhancing effective use of external resources more could also be done to leverage these resources to attract large private sector resources and the ensuing technology transfer that come with private sector investments.  
Rwanda has started developing an inclusive finance strategy and roll out innovative mechanisms to promote domestic savings. NST I aim at increasing the level of domestic savings as a foundation for investment; attracting foreign and local investment to improve competitiveness as well as using public private partnerships to unlock business potential. The country also aims at broadening its tax base and enhancing economic activities in the formal economy.  Its drive to create cashless economy and promote digitalization will enhance its success in promoting effective and innovative partnerships with private sector.  
Challenges 
As with other countries, gaps exist in data for effective monitoring of SDGs, the current national statistical system produces 60% of the SDGs applicable to Rwanda that have internationally established methodology. 
 
	3.6. 	Progress Against Selected Goals 
In addition to the SDGs proposed for 2019 VNR in-depth analysis, this report also briefly highlights progress against five more SDGs, namely: SDG1, SDG3, SDG5 and SDG9 as detailed below. Details of the status for all the SDGs are summarized in the table in the annex. 
 
3.6.1. SDG1 Ending Poverty in all its forms and everywhere 
 
 
Status and trends 
Rwanda’s progress towards ending poverty has been marked by remarkable progress in the period 2000 to 2014, but somewhat registered small reductions between 2014 and 2017. In terms of indicators, this trend is summarized by the proportion of population living below the national poverty line that was of 60.4% in 2000/01 to then reach 38.2% in 2017 (Indicator 1.2.1). However, considering the international poverty line is considered (USD 1.90/day), 56.8% of the Rwandan population fell below the threshold in 2013 against 55.5% in 20164 (Target 1.1/ Indicator 1.1.1). Further measures that consider poverty in all its dimensions, such as the Multidimensional Poverty Index, also showed a slight improvement passing from 0.17 in 2014 to 0.15 in 2017 (Indicator 1.2.2). 
Indicators related to social protection coverage (Target 1.3), showed mixed progress against the baseline (2014). Core social protection programmes covered 6.5% of the population in 2018 (Indicator 1.3.1), however the contributing members into pension funds grew from 465,579 to 539,219 and pension beneficiaries from 18,856 to 21,550. The same progression can be seen in the participation into medical schemes that increased from 133,415 active members (affiliates) to 147,170; the number of dependents passed from 243,421 to 285,280. Participation into the Community-Based Health Insurance scheme is at 83.3% of the population (2018), A net progress was recorded in terms of access to maternity leave benefits that grew from 0 to 164,601 women.

The impact of disasters on poverty (Target 1.5), is measured, amongst others, by the number of deaths, missing persons, and directly affected persons attributed to disasters per 100,000 people (Indicator 1.5.1). These rose in Rwanda from 183 deaths and 16,645 afflicted people in 2014 to 273 deaths and 80,164 afflicted people in 2017. Against this background, the number of local government entities that adopt and implement local disaster risk reduction strategies in line with national disaster risk reduction strategies passed from 22 to 29 (over a total of 30 districts) between 2014 and 2017 (Indicator 1.5.3). 
Challenges and opportunities for accelerating progress  
The overview provided above suggests a number of outstanding challenges that go well beyond poverty eradication. About 25% of the working age population, majority being women, is still engaged exclusively in subsistence agriculture and the sector contributed to about 30% of the gross domestic product.  
The number of newly created jobs is not meeting the pace of entrants into the labour market making it more complicated to reap the demographic dividend. Furthermore, the quality and value added of the available jobs is low; people working in elementary occupations consistently make up over 50% of the total employed.  
The country’s exposure to climate change, and its negative impact further detailed under Goal 13, puts a strain on its efforts to tackle poverty as climate related-shocks such as droughts and flooding impact on the livelihoods of the rural population, disrupt the production of staple goods, weigh in on the balance of payment, increase inflation and damage infrastructure.  
Ensuring economic growth is inclusive and broad-based is the first priority when it comes to tackle poverty eradication. The second is the capacity of the economy to continuously deliver quality jobs by increasing value addition and pursuing integration in the global value chains. This cannot be achieved without strong investments in human capital to ensure the availability of skilled labour force and the closing of the current skills gap. In turn, providing the entrants to the labour market with the skills required will help the country manage the demographic transition and exploit the demographic dividend by absorbing the new labour force. In parallel, gender sensitive social protection mechanisms will continue to be stepped up, increasing healthcare coverage and extending the reach of insurances and pension schemes to shield people from catastrophic events and expenditures that could push them back into poverty. The development of a climate smart agriculture and other investments in climate change adaptation will help shielding the more vulnerable population from the weather excesses and cushion their impact on the economy.  
 
 
3.6.2. SDG3 Ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages 
 
 
Status and Trends 
Rwanda has made impressive gains in health, placing the country as one of the few in Africa to achieve the MDGs health targets with a steady decline in maternal mortality falling from 1,071/100,000 (in 2000) to 210 (in 2014/15) (figure 10). The achieved results are primarily due to the Government concerted investment towards building a comprehensive health system. Consequently, the coverage of the first visit to antenatal care is now almost universal (99%, DHS 2015) and over 90 % of women have skilled assistance during delivery. Fertility rate has declined significantly from 6.1 births per woman of childbearing age in 2005 to 4.2 in 2014/15 with rural women having almost one child more than urban women (4.3 and 3.6 respectively) (DHS). 
Figure 10: Maternal mortality ratio for the period 0-4 years prior to the 2000, 2005,2010 and 2014/15 RDHS

Furthermore, Infant mortality has declined substantially in the past 10 years, from 86 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2005 to 62 per 1,000 live births in 2007-08, 50 per 1,000 live births in 2010, and 32 per 1,000 live births in 2014-15. Under-5 mortality also declined during this period, from 152 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2005 to 76 per 1,000 live births in 2010 and 50 per 1,000 live births in 2015 (figure 11). Child immunization coverage has steadily improved over the last 10 years: 93 % of children aged 12 to 23 months have received all basic vaccines and 89.4 % have vaccination cards, with no significant variation between boys and girls or between rural and urban locations (DHS 2014/15). Rwanda Vaccination program generally follows the World Health Organization (WHO, February 2015) recommended vaccines for routine immunization, and all required vaccines now are given in routine immunization. Each child who is vaccinated receives an immunization card on which all of the vaccines received are recorded.

Death rates due to road traffic accidents (per100,000 population) was 2.7 according to the 2018 statistical yearbook. Interventions to prevent these deaths include; Installation of speed governors into public transport buses to reduce roads accidents caused by over speeding, use of cameras and speed radars by law enforcers and regular public sensitization campaigns.   
Currently, there are 1,475 health facilities which include 8 referral hospitals, 4 provincial hospitals, 36 district hospitals, 4 specialized hospitals, 504 health centers, 670 health posts, 5 private clinics, 135 dispensaries, 13 specialized clinics and 96 clinics. Significant efforts have been made to increase health services at Sector and Cell level: there is at least one health centre per Sector and the plan is to roll out one health post per Cell (the second lowest level of local administration following the village). Access to health insurance has significantly improved (84 %), particularly for the poorest households. There are currently 1,392 medical doctors (one doctor per 10,055 people and 10,975 nurses (one nurse per 1,094 people compared to the World Health Organization target is one per 1,000). 
 
Since 2007, Rwanda has implemented a national Community Health Worker (CHW) program. The CHWs are recognized for their performance in community health mobilization, disease prevention and control at the community level. An effective CHWs chain is one of the reasons Rwanda achieved its health ambition in the past 10 years. To this effect, the decrease in under5 mortality has been attributed to the scaling up of this community health program, where community health workers started managing and treating children at the grass root level for selected most killer diseases. Every village (around 100–250 households) has four CHWs with a total 45,516 CHWs deployed countrywide.  At initial stage each village had 3 CHWs, two of these, a man and a woman, are called binômes, and they focus primarily on case identification and referral for a variety of diseases, as well as the treatment of childhood diseases like pneumonia, diarrhea, and malaria, and community support for malnutrition. Each village has a maternal health worker responsible for identification of pregnant women, antenatal care visits, ensuring delivery at health facilities and follow up of newborn and mother in postnatal period. Furthermore, in 2018, the country elected one more CHW per village raising the number to 4 in line with the Government priority of achieving universal health coverage. The fourth health worker is in charge of social affairs in the community and is responsible for the compilation of performance-based financing reports. CHWs receive performance-based financing through cooperatives.  
 
Based on its past success, the Health Sector under the new Strategic plan (4th HSSP 2018/192023/24) is proposing new priority orientation taking into account important changes in epidemiology, maternal and child health, Human Resources for health , infrastructure and service delivery linking it with Rwanda’s National Constitution and Vision 2050, NST 1, the Health Sector Policy 2015, Universal Health Coverage (UHC) principles and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).The Objective is to ensure universal accessibility (in geographical and financial terms) of equitable and affordable quality health services (preventative, curative, rehabilitative and promotional services) .  
 
Interventions and opportunities for accelerating progress 
HSSP 4 will continue to ensure that all persons in Rwanda have access to equitable and quality Maternal, Neonatal, Child & Community Health (MCCH) services; immunization coverage will be consistently maintained around 95% (or more) with the Government meeting at least 30% of the full cost of vaccines. Stunting will be reversed by implementing multi-sectoral interventions described in SDG2; uptake of long-term methods in FP services will be increased by targeted promotion activities; palliative services and health needs of the elderly are mainstreamed in the essential package of care at the different levels, including the package at household level.  
In tackling communicable and non-communicable diseases, emphasis will be to reduce prevalence and incidence in morbidity / mortality through expanded, responsive and client centered services; improved diagnostic capacity; control of risk factors and scaling up preventive efforts related to life-style interventions (nutrition, sugar, exercise, alcohol, smoking). In health security, HSSP 4 seeks to ensure that Rwanda is free of epidemic-prone diseases and public health threats through building a sustainable, effective and efficient national surveillance, response and recovery system. 
The cost of implementing HSSP 4 has been computed using the OneHealth tool. At the end of the period, the mean per capita cost would be 60 USD per capita, up from per capita in 2018 or 36 USD per capita during the last health sector strategic plan.  
Innovations 
Rwanda lifesaving blood and medicines deliveries using drones  
 Rwanda delivers lifesaving blood and medicines to about 21 regional hospitals launching more than 50 drones daily for on-demand deliveries. Remote clinics can 
now place orders for lifesaving blood via text message, with drones dispatched from fulfillment centers dotted around the country to deliver it. Since its launch, drones have flown over 300,000 miles on more than 10,000 flights, delivering thousands of units of blood. 
 
 
Challenges  
One serious drawback over the last years was the upsurge of Malaria cases that started in the end of 2012 and continues till today. Malaria incidence rate stands at 308 to 1,000 people (Malaria Annual Report 2015-2016). Experts attribute this upsurge to several factors occurring not only in Rwanda, but also wider in the sub-region, such as vector density and resistance, climate change (increase in temperature and rainfall), human behaviour and non-universal coverage of effective interventions, despite a sustained and intensive effort by the Government. By 2024, the target is to decrease Malaria incidence from 308/1,000 to 122/1,000 population and the mortality due to malaria in health facilities to decrease by 40%. The Government will ensure sustained universal coverage of Long Lasting Insecticide Nets (LLNs): UHC (1 net per 2 people), improve malaria vector control through implementation of Indoor Residual Spraying in high burden districts and early diagnosis and treatment. Furthermore, the HSSP4 targets to reduce the prevalence of Soil Transmitted Helminthiasis (STH) from 45% to less than 20% by 2024. Meeting these targets requires strengthening inter-sectoral collaboration and partnership for effective Malaria and Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) prevention and control interventions. 
 
Under-five mortality remains high at 50 deaths per 1,000 live births compared to the SDG target of 25 deaths per 1,000 live births. Moreover, the Under-five mortality is twice as high in the poorest quintile than in the richest (84 per 1,000 live births compared to 40 per 1,000 live births, respectively). Declines in neonatal mortality have been only modest, indicating that further investment in neonatal and antenatal care is required as well as strengthening the quality of assisted delivery services.  
 
After increasing from 17 % in 2005 to 52% in 2010, the use of any method for family planning only changed slightly in 2014-15 (53 %). Use of any modern method for family planning also increased dramatically between 2005 and 2010 (from 10 % to 45 %) and then rose slightly in 2014-15 (48 %). To address the slowing adoption of contraceptive use, the government will continue to implement community peer education system promoting the continuous use of longacting and permanent methods of FP services and emergency contraceptives. 
 
Specialized physicians represent a small portion (24%) in 2015 of the total physicians in clinical practice in the country. Additionally, specialized physicians are mainly located in and around Kigali City whereas 76% of general practitioners are distributed in district hospitals in the rural areas. The process for continuous learning of the graduates to have specialization at all levels of health professional cadres is still low (A0/A1 nurses represent 31% of all nurses, and specialized physicians 24% of all physicians). The HRH quality improvement targets both health care providers and health managers and is conducted in close collaboration with the Ministry of Education, in charge of overseeing the content of curricula. In parallel, collaboration with various top international universities, which provide every year professors to teach and train Rwandan doctors at specialization level has been initiated in order to increase the number of qualified and specialized doctors. 
 
 
3.6.3. SDG 5 Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls 
 
 
Status and trend  
Gender Equality and Women Empowerment (GEWE) is one of the areas in which Rwanda is globally recognized for its outstanding progress. In Rwanda, promoting gender equality and empowerment of women is primarily a human right issue, encompassing women and girls' equal rights, combatting discriminatory practices and challenging the roles and stereotypes that propagate inequalities and exclusion. 
The Rwanda’s strong political will to mainstream gender into Government programs is underpinned by institutional and policy frameworks that have been key to Rwanda’s progress in addressing gender inequalities. Over the past two decades, socio-economic outcomes have improved significantly and the country has emerged as a regional and global leader in advancing gender equality. With regard to legal framework (Indicator 5.1.1), the Constitution of the Republic on Rwanda enshrines the principles of gender equality and women’s rights and provides for a minimum of 30% quota for women in all decision-making organs. Rwanda has also enacted a number of legal instruments for strengthening GEWE, including: the Organic Law N° 12/2013/OL of 12/09/2013 on State Finances and Property, the Law N° 43/2013 of 
16/06/2013 Governing Land in Rwanda and the Law Nº27/2016 of 08/07/2016 Governing Matrimonial Regimes, Donations and Successions. Furthermore, gender equality is a crosscutting area across Government policies and strategies at national and sub-national levels. 
With regard to violence (Indicators: 5.2.1), GBV has been criminalized and is therefore punishable under Law No 68/2018 of 30/08/2018 determining offenses and penalties for child defilement, marital rape, sexual violence and harassment of a spouse. Data from the DHS 2014/15 shows that the proportion of ever-partnered women and girls aged 15 years and older subjected to violence in 12 months preceding the survey are still high, 17.6% physical, 8.3% sexual and 18.5% emotional violence by a current or former intimate partner. In addition, 7.6% of women were victim of sexual violence from a person other than intimate partner (Indicator 5.2.2). Health wise, 83% of women reported that they alone or with their spouses take decision on their reproductive health, while 48% use a modern method of contraception. These statistics call for more efforts to address sexual gender based violence (SGBV) in both public and private spaces, which the Government of Rwanda together with partners are striving to solve.   
The Government of Rwanda has continued to strengthen systems providing integrated services for victims of SGBV through Isange One Stop Centres (IOSCs), which have been increased from 23 to 44 over the last three years of SDGs implementation. IOSC provide comprehensive services to victims of GBV under the same roof free of charge on a 24 hours 7 days basis. These services include medical care, psychosocial support, legal services, relief, temporary shelter and re-integration. Following a successful scale up of IOSCs services to District hospital level in attempt to bring IOSC services closer to the community, the Government has started to implement the scale up plan of IOSC services to at least Health Centre level. Once completed, the number of IOSC is estimated to increase to close to 500. 
At the community level, there are structures like “Umugoroba W’Ababyeyi“(Parents Evening), “Inshuti z’Umuryango“(Friends of the Family) that gather on a day to day basis to discuss the wellbeing of families where GBV and child abuse issues are addressed among other issues. With regard to GBV data collection, an integrated Gender Based Violence Information Management System (GBVIMS) is under elaboration to regularly generate GBV data for evidence-based decision making and quality service delivery to GBV and child abuse victims.  
Women’s empowerment and participation in decision-making is mainly captured by the ratios of women in parliament, ministerial positions, and other positions in various structures of governance both in public, private, and civil society entities. Further, the Government of Rwanda has established the National Women Council with structures from national to village level and over 122,059 committee members to mobilize and empower women to participate in all national development programs. Women’s representation in the Cabinet has reached 50% (2019) from 36.8% in 2014. In the on-going term of 2018-2023, women parliamentarians stand at 61.3% in the lower chamber and 38% in the Senate. At decentralized levels, women’s share in the leadership has improved during the period 2016-2018 from 16.7% to 26.7% among District Mayors and 45.2% in District Councils. According to the 2018 LFS, the proportion of women in managerial positions (Indicator 5.5.2) represented 34% with 33.5% of Chief executives, senior officials and legislators and 34.5% Administrative and commercial managers. 
DHS5 also suggests that the proportion of women aged 15–49 years who make their own informed decisions regarding the use of any contraceptive methods was estimated at 53% 
(Indicator 5.6.1).  
With regard to land ownership (indicator 5.a.2), article 4 of Law N° 43/2013 of 16/06/2013 governing land in Rwanda, guarantees equal right to land and stipulates that all forms of discrimination, such as that based on sex or origin, in relation to access to land and the enjoyment of real rights shall be prohibited. The right to land for a man and a woman lawfully married shall depend on the matrimonial regime they opted for. In this regard, data from the Rwanda Natural Resources Authority shows that married couples represent 58.3% of the land owners, while women owning land alone represent 24% of land owners, and men owning land alone represent 14%.

The ownership of mobile phones has improved in Rwanda with 67% of the households owning at least one mobile phone in 2015/17 compared to 64% in 2013/14. Mobile telephone subscription reached 77% as of end March 2019.

Rwanda developed a Women Empowerment through ICT (WEM-TECH) strategy to increase women’s access and usage of technologies. Initiatives were put in place to set up a friendly business environment including ICT tax exemption, which contributed to phone and Internet penetration, 76% and 45.5% respectively and also increased women’s access to mobile phones from 35.1% in 2010 to 84%6 in 2016. ICT awareness campaigns, mentorship, coaching programs and career guidance increased female upper secondary school students in Sciences from 53.7 % in 2014 to 55.2 % in 2017. Initiatives such as Viziyo, Digital Ambassadors program, ICT Bus, Service Access Points, Smart Village, TechKobwa6, Miss Geek competition, Girls in ICT, and STEM Camps helped women to join and embrace digital skills and access different opportunities including education, health and financial services among others. The HeForShe national impact commitments to bridge the gender digital divide and attain parity in ICT access, usage and innovation and tripling girls’ enrolment in TVET to advance women’s employment opportunities by 2020 has been mainstreamed and catered for in national plans and budget. 
 
With regards to financing for gender equality, the Government of Rwanda in partnership with other stakeholders has institutionalized Gender Responsive Budgeting (GRB) programme that constitutes a mandatory annex (Gender Budget Statement) to the budget framework paper by all budget agencies and annually submitted to the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning and the Parliament for budget negotiations and approval. This has enabled public institutions to use public resources in a manner that benefits both men and women and boys and girls. 
With regards to gender mainstreaming, collection of gender statistics and disaggregated data, through GRB programme, the Government of Rwanda in partnership with the University of Rwanda and other stakeholders established a Gender Economic Policy Management course to enhance skills of experts and policy makers in gender economic policy management and analysis. Furthermore, 11 out of 16 sectors have developed and implemented gender sector mainstreaming strategies. NISR in collaboration with the National Gender Machinery and other partners regularly generate gender statistics for evidence-based policy and decision making. The 3 - year regular household and living conditions survey (EICV) has a specific Gender Thematic Report on relevant gender statistics. Other sources of gender disaggregated data include among others the Gender Management Information System (GMIS), Gender Sector Profiles as well as administrative data from institutions and organizations’ reports with inclusion of relevant gender specific information needed to inform policy and decision makers on issues of gender equality and empowerment of women. Gender mainstreaming initiatives under private sector have been undertaken through the gender equality seal. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Gender Equality Seal for private and public institutions 
Rwanda is recognized as one of the global champions in gender equality as confirmed by the global gender gap report 2018, which ranked Rwanda number 6 globally. While a lot of progress was recorded particularly in the public sector, there are persisting challenge s particularly in the private sector. Evidence shows that women are paid 13 % lower than men, partly resulting from the fact that men spend more time on economic activities and less time on domestic activities compared to women. As a matter of fact, according to EICV  4, women spend 25 hours per week on domestic duties and 28 hours per week on economic activities while men spend only 8 hours per week on domestic duties and 35 hour per week on economic activities. In 2017, Rwanda 
 launched the Gender equality Seal certification initiative, which enhances the capacities of private companies and public institutions in gende r analysis and gender mainstreaming to ensure they duly implement gender equality commitments. It seeks to support the private sector to achieve sustainable development by reducing gender gaps and promoting both gender equality in the workplace and women’s  economic empowerment. Giving equal opportunities to both men and women is a good strategy to increase productivity and sustain economic returns for participating companies and institutions.  
 
The initiative is implemented by the Gender Monitoring Office (GMO) in partnership with the United Nations Development (UNDP) and the Private Sector Federation (PSF). 36 private sector companies and 2 public institutions have joined the initiative. It 	 supports participating institutions in their efforts to mainstream gender equality and women empowerment along the six key pillars of the Gender Equality Seal:  	 
            * Eliminating gender-based pay gaps;  
            * Increasing women’s role in decision-making;  
            * Enhancing work-life balance;  
            * Enhancing women’s/men’s access to non-traditional jobs;  
            * Eradicating sexual harassment at work; and    Using inclusive non-sexist communication. Challenges and opportunities for accelerating progress  
Furthermore, capacity for collecting sex-disaggregated data and conducting gender analysis at various levels and across sectors to inform policy and program design and implementation needs to be strengthened. 
Increasing opportunities for women to access and use financial schemes and strengthening women’ employability skills will continue to be promoted to improve women’s role in the national socio-economic transformation. 
The strong engagement of men in gender equality dialogues and participation in activities traditionally seen as women’ issues such as family planning, child care etc., will continue to play an important role in accelerating implementation of gender equality in Rwanda. 
Ensuring that gender equality dimensions are systematically mainstreamed in different accountability mechanisms such as IMIHIGO (performance contracts), public hearings, etc., will ensure ownership and gender responsiveness by different implementing agencies. 
 
3.6.4 SDG 9. Build resilient infrastructure, promote sustainable industrialization and foster innovation 
 
Status and Trends 
Rwanda has a Vision of becoming an upper middle-income country by 2035 and high-income country by 2050 through transforming its economy from agrarian base to a more industrial, diversified and knowledge-based economy. The medium-term plans and sector policies prioritize economic transformation as an important strategic pillar. This objective means that significant infrastructure development is needed to propel the economy to higher value sectors. Within this strategic policy framework, Rwanda has been pursuing investments to increase the domestic connectivity of the Rwandan economy through investments in hard and soft infrastructure; increase the external connectivity of Rwanda’s economy and boosting exports; increasing investment in priority sectors; facilitating urbanization and promoting secondary cities; and pursuing a ‘green economy’ approach to economic transformation.  
Recognizing the central role infrastructure plays in economic transformation, Rwanda made continuous investments to unlock constraints for economic transformation, mainly in energy, transport and logistics and services. While enhancing the efficiency of its transportation and logistics services, the country invested jointly with the private sector to building a strong information and communication infrastructure. Furthermore, to fill the immediate need to create appropriate infrastructure for industrialization, Rwanda is developing Special Economic Zones (SEZs) and industrial parks as an economic policy tool that promotes private investment, industry and export growth.  The country also set a target for creating job opportunities outside the agriculture sector with special focus on creating decent and productive jobs (1.5 million jobs between 2017 and 2024).   It also coupled its efforts to develop infrastructure with creating conducive environment for business. Rwanda has made steady progress in implementing reforms aimed at minimizing regulatory hurdles for business start-ups, guiding and mentoring entrepreneurs through the start-up administrative process, as well as building entrepreneurs’ confidence in the regulatory environment. Rwanda promotes access to finance to entrepreneurs through innovative mechanisms. As a result, Rwanda was ranked second in Africa in the World Bank Doing Business Report of 2017and has maintained such a position over the last few years. The economic transformation effort is further facilitated by an ambitious policy of ‘Made in Rwanda’ that seeks to improve perceptions of Rwandan products within Rwanda, promote nascent industries, and boost productivity of exporting sectors across regional value chains. Thus, the progress made in this goal is at large positive and encouraging.  
Rwanda has been experiencing impressive economic growth in the last decade, primarily driven by the service, agriculture and mining sectors. Underlying such impressive growth, concerted effort to connect the majority of the Rwandan population living in rural areas to markets and major cities is yielding significant results.  In 2016, the proportion of the rural population who live within 2 km of an all-season road (Indicator 9.1.1) reached 63%. Recently completed impact evaluation shows that investments in rural roads are extremely beneficial to households who are poor with an estimated increase in incomes of nearly 20% in the most remote villages. Encouraged by the significant progress, the Government of Rwanda is engaged in an ambitious rural road improvement program targeting 21 districts across all 4 provinces. The program aims to bring a motorable road within 2 km of all farms in Rwanda by 2025.  
In further improving infrastructure service, Rwanda has invested heavily in developing its air transport infrastructure services.  As a result, Rwanda has made significant progress towards the target of increasing passenger and freight volumes (Indicator 9.1.2), with RwandAir’s passenger numbers increasing from 377,327 in 2012 to 926,571 as of 2017/18. The airline has increased its fleet size while its network destinations have increased to 27. RwandAir seeks to further increase its network across Africa and beyond. Furthermore, visible progress has been registered in developing its air transport infrastructure.  Kigali International Airport has been upgraded and renovated to accommodate traffic growth; Kamembe airport was also upgraded with the extension and resurfacing of the runaway; the construction and enabling works for the new Bugesera Airport is underway. Similarly, the country is strategically investing in railway to promote connectivity and overcome the significant challenge of being landlocked. In this regards, Dar-es-Salaam-Isaka- Kigali/Keza-Musongati (DIKKM) Railway Project jointly implemented by the governments of Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi is still underway. 
In close collaboration with private sector, Rwanda invested significantly to promote universal and affordable access to Information, Communication and Technology (ICT). Rwanda aims at scaling up broadband coverage to all citizens through the roll out of the 4G network, promoting internet of things and increase smart devices penetration as part of the National Strategy for Transformation (NST I). The ICT sector in Rwanda recorded a general growth in terms of subscriptions, revenues and investments since its liberalization. The percentage of the population covered by a mobile cellular network (indicator 9.c.1) has expanded rapidly reaching 96.6 % in 2018/19 for 4G technology from 89% in 2017.   The country has reached 99 % for the 2G and 3G technologies. 
Internet subscriptions reached 6,149,425 (close to 50% of the population) as at December 2018. Mobile-broadband internet subscriptions reached 28 per100 in 2017.  
Building on progress so far, Rwanda is promoting industrialization and attaining a structural shift in the export base to high-value goods and services with the aim of growing exports by 17% annually by 2024. Rwanda made some progress in bringing structural transformation, with manufacturing value added as a proportion of GDP (Indicator 9.2.1) reaching 6% in 2017/18; while industry sector contribution to GDP reached 17.0 % in the same period. In connection to this, the contribution of manufacturing employment as a proportion of total employment (Indicator 9.2.2) reached 6.4% in 2017/18. In terms of promoting research and development as a key to fast-tracking Rwanda’s economic transformation especially in technology for industrial development, increasingly significant resources are being allocated.   
Figure 14: Industry and Manufacturing Value Added as a share of GDP

With the development of industrial parks and Special Economic Zones (SEZs), Rwanda aims at developing selected priority value chains including agro-processing, construction materials, light manufacturing, meat and dairy, leather, textiles and garments, horticulture, tourism (including MICE tourism), knowledge-based services, logistics and transport. By 2024, Rwanda aims at creating 1,500,000 (over 214,000 annually) decent and productive jobs; of which significant share will be manufacturing employment.  
Challenges and Opportunities to accelerate Progress 
While Rwanda has made significant progress in developing its infrastructure for economic transformation, challenges remain. Limited physical infrastructure – exacerbated by hilly and mountainous topography - remains a major constraint for smallholder farmers to increasing their access to markets, enhancing their competitiveness and improving their incomes and livelihoods. This is also affecting the pace of structural transformation.  
While strategic focus is being accorded to expand export-oriented industrialization; the pace of growth in this sector is yet to reach the desired levels. This is largely due to low levels of productivity in agriculture; comparable production capabilities within the East African region that constrain the competitiveness of Rwandan products, recent global commodity price fluctuations and the limited capabilities for rapid industrialization both at private and public sector levels.  
To further accelerate progress in this Goal, Rwanda will need to sustain the investment in infrastructure while balancing the investment needs with stable macroeconomic framework. In addition, there will be need to attract additional investments, largely from private sector in manufacturing and high value-added service sector.  Rwanda will further need to exploit untapped regional and global market potential through economic specialization and economies of scale. Enhancing labor productivity across sectors is key for rapid transformation of the economy. In this regard, leveraging investments in social sectors, particularly investments on human development will be fundamental.   
Rwanda is positioning itself to benefit from new technologies associated with the fourth industrial revolution by preparing its population to tap into the opportunities this new wave presents and manage associated risks. Rwanda will seize regional trade opportunities through intraregional trade and participation in regional value chains connected to the global market. 
 
 	 
Chapter IV. Means of Implementation  
 
To meet the ambitious goals of NST1 and SDGs in a meaningful way will not be without its challenges.  Achieving the SDG will depend on Rwanda’s ability to meet annual growth rate of above 10% according to the DFID assessment on mobilizing new resources for Development finance (NST1 growth rate target is 9.1 %), which will require investment rates between 35% and 40% of GDP. This represents a substantial increase from Rwanda’s current investment rate of approximately 26%. Public revenues in Rwanda have mainly been driving the economic growth in the past two decades. Various reforms were implemented to build the country tax system including the creation of Rwanda Revenue Authority (RRA) in 1998, replacement of an inefficient sales tax with a more modern value-added tax (VAT) in 2001, increasing taxpayer outreach and raising the number of registered taxpayers, providing better services, enhanced use of information technology (IT) and improving the use of risk management in conducting taxpayer audits.  
Furthermore, recent tax policy changes involving the ‘Electronic Billing Machine (EBM) for all’ an internet based electronic billing machine client software offered for free to all VAT registered taxpayers, the enactment of the law amending excise duties and amendments to taxes on income involving capping of management fees to 2 %, excluding liberal professionals from lumpsum/flat regime and the implementation of the transfer pricing guidelines which will help the Rwanda Revenue Authority conduct proper audits of multinational companies ( banks, telecoms, insurance and mining companies) are expected to boost the revenue collections in 2018/19. The proportion of domestic budget funded by domestic taxes have increase from 62.6% in 2016/17 reaching 67% in 2018/19 (indicator 17.1.2)  
Attracting the private sector investments in critical development sectors is expected to have a pivotal role in the delivery of the SDGs through promoting the Public Private Partnership (PPP) and joint venture modalities. Consequently, the government of Rwanda enacted the PPP LAW Nº14/2016 of 02/05/2016 and in 2018 the PPP guideline was developed to facilitate its smooth implementation. The private sector is still small and predominantly dominated by micro, small and medium size enterprises and accounts for 93% average capital employed of RwF 16.3 million (USD 26,080), (AfDB, 2013). Although, the volume of FDI have seen increase from USD 342.3 million in 2016 to USD 356.4 million in 2017, nevertheless FDI contribution to GDP still remains low at 3%. Therefore, the government is considering the partnerships, including public, publicprivate and multi-stakeholder modalities as an effective vehicle to appeal to the Foreign investors as well as boosting the private sector to achieve Rwanda’s vision of becoming a strong private led economy in 2030. 
Furthermore, the Government is leveraging on various other financing mechanisms to raise additional public and private finance such as the Green Financing and Climate change financing, remittances and blended Finance.  
Rwanda is one of the few countries that have managed to establish a specific fund for Environment and Natural Resources. The government of Rwanda created the Environmental Law in 2005 that provided for the creation of FONERWA. In 2012, the government created the Green Fund (FONERWA) as a tool to implement the GGCRS.  Rwanda's Green Fund (FONERWA) is a ground-breaking environment and climate change fund. Its purpose is to be 

the engine for the next 50 years of green growth in Rwanda, while serving as a touchstone for Africa and the rest of the world. Its strategy is to provide unheralded technical and financial support to the best public and private projects that align with Rwanda’s commitment to a green economy. FONERWA provides loans and grants to government institutions, private sector and civil society organizations for green projects. Since its creation, FONERWA has mobilized more than 170.1 million USD from its development partners and financed 33 green projects.  
FONERWA in partnership with UNDP launched Online Centre of Excellence tool for knowledge sharing which gathers knowledge products from agencies under Ministry of Environment and FONERWA stakeholders as well as partners. In addition, FONERWA through the 
Public-Private Partnership on electronic waste management creating job and protecting the environment 
In 2014, in partnership with the Ministry of Trade and Industry, FONERWA invested close to USD 1.5 million to establish an ewaste recycling facility, which was later on leased out to EnviroServe Rwanda. Apart from reducing issues related to e-waste to the country, the company creates green jobs and injects 5% of its revenue in FONERWA. EnviroServe Rwanda has the capacity to employ more than 1,000 people- making it the second state-of-the-art e-waste dismantling and recycling facility in Africa. Since it began operations, the e-waste recycling facility has processed more than 434 tons of materials and prevented 870 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from entering the atmosphere. 

South-south cooperation hosted and shared its experiences with countries that intend to replicate the FONERWA model in Uganda, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Malawi, Burkina Faso and Zimbabwe. 
Remittances can constitute an important source of finance for private sector, especially as they may be available in the local currency. World Bank (2010) recognized that in 2010 the stock of emigrants was 263.4 thousand (2.6% of total population) and increased to 345.8 thousand in 2013. Also, according to the National Bank of Rwanda (BNR), in 2017 the remittance inflows accounted for 207.6 million of USD compared to 166.2 million USD in 2011. The Government of Rwanda has demonstrated to have clearly acknowledged the role and the potential of Diaspora, first of all by sanctioning some inviolable  rights  of  Rwandans emigrants (articles 7, 23 and 24 of the Rwandan Constitution) and also by developing a defined Diaspora Policy (Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 2009). 
AGDF Corporate Trust limited (previously Agaciro Fund) has raised RwF 62 billion since its creation in 2012 and is Rwanda’s first sovereign wealth fund. It currently invests in government bonds and short-term bank deposits (earning 8-12 per cent interest).  
Spending Needs to Reach the SDGs goals 
The total costs to deliver on NST1 which covers part of the first 7 years of the SDGs period is estimated to range from 43 percent of GDP in FY16/17 to 47 percent of GDP in FY23/24. The International Monetary Fund in joint collaboration with AFR – FAD conducted a costing assessment on the SDGs selected sectors with the involvement of stakeholders from the government (Education, Health, Infrastructure and Finance Ministries) and DPs (UNDP, World Bank, UK DFID, USAID, SDG Center for Africa, Enabel, UNICEF).  All line ministries have already produced sectoral strategies and preliminary estimates of sectoral spending needs for achieving the NST1. Several other costing exercises have been conducted by individual line ministries with the support of the DPs such as the Onehealth for the Ministry of Health, Education budgeting and WASH costing among others.  
According to the same IMF assessment, the overall additional spending needs that was estimated to achieve a higher SDG implementation by 2030 for these selected sectors are substantial and reach about 20 % of GDP. The breakdown of costing per each selected sector is provided under table 11. Furthermore, in the following sub- section details are provided tallying both NST1 preliminary costing and the IMF costing exercise.  
 
Table 11: Estimated Spending Needs in Rwanda 
 (Additional percent of GDP per year) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Education  
The education sector budget for the year 2017/18 is estimated to be 13.1% (241 billion RWF) of the Government’s national budget which is slightly under the international guideline of 15 -20%. Out of this budget the biggest share is allocated to primary education with 40% followed by 30% for secondary education, 12% for higher education and TVET and 1.7% for pre-primary level.  
By 2030, the Rwandan government plans to double current spending in education, to reach 6.3 % of GDP from 3.2 % (2017). The additional spending will be earmarked for hiring more qualified teachers to reduce the student-to-teacher ratio, especially at the primary level, where repetition rates are higher. However, according to the 2017 IMF study on SDGs spending needs, Rwanda requires 4% of GDP in addition to the set 6.3% reaching at level of 10.7% of GDP if it is to attain the level of peer countries with better performance by 2030 (figures 15). Hence the overall education spending would need to increase by 7% of GDP.

Health  
Rwanda’s health sector budget has increased from 157.5 billion RWF in 2013/14 to 193.6 billion RWF in 2017/18. The government has attained the Abuja declaration of allocating 15% of the national budget to health sector (HSSP 4)7. Moreover, the use of home-grown approaches using health clinics as the first line for service delivery in rural areas and the introduction of technology including the use of drones to deliver lifesaving blood in remote and inaccessible areas have enabled the sector to efficiently use public resources to improve access and quality of healthcare. The cost of implementing HSSP4 has been projected to reach RWF 4,290,170.71 million (4.29 trillions) for the 7 years of the NST1 period. The mean per capita spending is expected to reach 60 USD per capita at the end of year 7 from 36 USD per capita in 2018. According to the IMF analyses the required per capita spending should double to 73 USD instead of 60 USD as estimated in NST1 (figure 16) if Rwanda is to achieve its health ambition.

Water and Sanitation (WATSAN): 
The total cost to deliver the WATSAN 7 years program under NST1 is estimated at 795 billion Frw, which corresponds to approximately 935 $USD millions and the higher share of spending (26%) is allocated towards improving and sustained urban and rural households’ access to safe drinking water. Based on the World Bank WASH costing model, Rwanda would need to spend 4.5% (figure 18) of GDP per year to safely provide water to all households and provide fixedpoint latrines to all. The large share of spending is accounted for a growing urban population with increased water demand.

Electricity  
The total cost for the Energy Sector under the NSTI period is estimated at $3.3 billion for the three subsectors: electricity, biomass and petroleum with the largest expenditure ($2.8 billion) going towards electrification. The large cost attached to Electricity is due to the government plan to building new power stations and transmission lines.  NST 1 and Energy Sector Strategic Plan estimates 52% on-grid and 48% off-grid, and the IMF projects that electricity will increase at the annual rate of (reaching 730 kWh in 2030 from an average of 238 kWh in 2016), universal access cost is estimated at 2% of GDP. 
Challenges  
Mobilizing commercial investment in Rwanda including Foreign Direct Investment is hampered by the fact that the country is landlocked presenting challenges due to the high cost of transport and longer time required both at the importation of raw materials as well as exports of finished goods. 
 	 

Chapter V. Conclusion  
 
The Government of Rwanda has taken important steps towards an effective domestication of the Agenda 2030 by integrating and localizing the SDGs in the Vision 2050, the medium-term development strategy, the National Strategy for Transformation, NST 1 (2017-2024) and related sector and district strategies following the roadmap approved by the Cabinet in December 2015.  
 
Accordingly, the ambitious nature of SDGs is fully reflected in the transformational spirit of NST 1 across all its three pillars (economic, social and transformational Governance) that mirror the three dimensions of sustainable development. 
 
The Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning is mandated to coordinate SDGs implementation and is supported by a multi-stakeholder structure that not only allows for an all government approach but also encompasses other players such as development partners, civil society, private sector, citizens among others.   
 
This VNR highlights challenges, lessons learned and emerging issues in order to guide policy and program direction for accelerated implementation of SDGs in Rwanda. 
 
The VNR findings underscore the commitment of the Government of Rwanda to implementing the SDGs taking into account key principles such as leaving no one behind and gender mainstreaming. The SDGs indicators are mainstreamed in the mid-term strategies at national and subnational levels, which requires an overarching approach to address the interlinkages and enhance cooperation among stakeholders. 
 
This VNR also suggests that sustained inclusive economic growth and human development are and will remain at the center of the Government of Rwanda’s interventions aiming at accelerating the implementation of SDGs. In this regard, the incorporation of SDG indicators into the home-grown planning and implementation tools, such as the Imihigo (performance contracts) at national and district levels will strength ownership and enhance fast delivery of the Agenda 2030.  
 
The review also highlights pivotal role of civil society organizations, private sector players and the development partners in delivering SDGs and other national priorities. This is in addition to the continued need for innovative approaches and strategies for resource mobilization (domestic and external) for the implementation of the SDGs. 
 
More efforts are still needed to strengthen coordination, monitoring and evaluation system for SDGs and in addressing the prevailing data gaps across sectors. In addition, addressing child malnutrition, poverty eradication and provision of decent and productive jobs especially for youth and women will continue to be the focus of NST 1.  
 
Rwanda will build on its previous success in developing innovative policies and leverage on Home-Grown Solutions that have multiple development effects while “leaving no one behind”. 
The Agenda 2030 requires strong and committed leadership and it is in this same spirit that Rwanda renews its commitments to accelerating progress through carrying out various farreaching reforms and strengthening cooperation with all stakeholders. The hosting of the SDG Center for Africa with the mandate to support the entire continent is testament to this political commitment to deliver on the Agenda 2030. 
 
Lessons learnt 
 
1. Visionary and committed leadership is an important driver of the intended socioeconomic transformation and the delivery of the Agenda 2030. 
 
2. Rwanda has learnt that adopting an integrated approach for planning, delivering and monitoring of interventions is pivotal for addressing poverty and malnutrition related challenges. The establishment of NECDP and the multi-sectoral strategy for eliminating extreme poverty are evidence of how different sectors have come together to address issues of malnutrition and extreme poverty. 
 
3. Rwanda has also learnt that building on the Home-Grown Solutions, rooted in the Rwandan culture, resource-efficient and adapted to the national context allows popular ownership and participation and ensures effective and faster delivery of development and strengthens accountability.
