I. Introduction 
 
       In September 2015, the Member States of the United Nations committed themselves to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (herein the 2030 Agenda), containing 17 Goals and 169 Targets, most of which are to be achieved by 2030. The 2030 Agenda goes much further than the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), addressing the root causes of poverty and the universal need for sustainable development that works for all people. Encompassing universal, transformative, inclusive and integrated goals and targets that herald a historic turning point for our world, the 2030 Agenda is arguably the most comprehensive global agenda adopted since the launch of the current international system in 1945. 
       The Republic of Korea (ROK) has been a model of development success for developing countries, having lifted itself out of poverty to achieve economic affluence and democracy. The ROK has also transformed itself from a recipient country of Official Development Assistance (ODA) into the 23rd largest Development Assistance Committee (DAC) donor in terms of its ODA as a percentage of GNI, and the 16th largest donor by volume for many years. Overcoming a series of economic crises, including the Asian Financial Crisis in the late 1990s, within a short time period by successfully responding economically and socially to further develop an inclusive society is another feature of the ROK’s development experience.  
       Furthermore, the ROK’s commitment to sustainable development, which started with the Earth Summit in 1992, constitutes an important baseline for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda in the ROK. In 1995, vibrant and voluntary civil society movements led to the establishment of the Local Councils for Sustainable Development (LCSDs), a wide network of local governments and civil society organizations (CSOs) that has launched various campaigns related to environmental and governance issues. The LCSD model is highly regarded by the international community and in 2002 it was introduced as one of the best practices at the World Summit on Sustainable Development.  
 Nonetheless, the country is faced with several challenges. The income gap has increased, which is partly attributable to the decline in the size of the economically active population. Continuous urbanization, which reached the level where 91.7 percent of the population lived in urban areas in 2014, also raises a challenge to sustainable urban environments. There are other factors such as underemployment, an ageing population, environmental degradation, greenhouse gas emissions, and the safe management of toxic chemical agents that affect the quality of life and sustainable development of the ROK.  
 Continuous, concerted efforts on the part of the government, civil society and the private sector have been made to address these problems and to move forward toward an improved level of development. The 2030 Agenda provides the ROK with a ripe opportunity to move forward and to address these challenges in a more guided and coherent manner with its 169 targets that cover virtually all the aspects of human life.   
 The purpose of this Voluntary National Review (herein the Review) is to provide an analysis of the ROK’s efforts to create enabling environments for the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and of the prospects, challenges and opportunities that the ROK will likely face in its journey toward realizing the SDGs. By explaining its best practices and policy innovations, it also aims to share knowledge with all the stakeholders within and outside the ROK.  
       The Review is structured as follows. The following section introduces the methodology adopted for the Review. It is followed by a section describing the efforts taken toward achieving sustainable development prior to and after the adoption of the 2030 Agenda. It specifically deals with: key institutions, processes and actors creating ownership of the SDGs; efforts to incorporate the SDGs into policy frameworks for domestic and international implementation of the SDGs; diverse ways of integrating the social, economic and environmental dimensions of the SDGs into policies and actions; an analysis of the initiatives related to ensuring the principle of leaving no one behind; and the efforts to adapt the institutional framework to implement the SDGs.  
       Following this, the Review discusses implementation with a focus on financial means for domestic and international implementation. After introducing the next steps for various stakeholders to enhance the implementation of the SDGs, it concludes with a summary of the ROK’s institutional and organizational preparation for the implementation of the SDGs, and identifies the challenges, limitations and opportunities for furthering the enabling environment for SDGs implementation. 
 II. Methodologies and Process for Preparation of the Review 
 
       In order to prepare this Review, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) held a series of meetings that were joined by related government bodies, including the Office for Government Policy Coordination (OGPC), the Ministry of Environment (MOE) and the National Statistical Office (herein Statistics Korea). In close cooperation among government offices, the ROK’s efforts toward sustainable development prior to and after the adoption of the SDGs were analyzed and laid the foundation for the framework of this Review. In drafting and completing the Review, the MOFA invited experts from academia, namely Hankuk University of Foreign Studies (Seoul, Republic of Korea) and United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD) (Geneva, Switzerland), which contributed to the Review by undertaking interviews with key stakeholders, collecting statistical data, producing a background paper and providing editorial support. 
       The Review also reflects inputs from CSOs. By holding two open government-civil society dialogues, the Review was able to incorporate valuable insights and suggestions from a number of CSOs. Based on the suggestions in the proposal for voluntary common reporting guidelines for Voluntary National Reviews at the High Level Political Forum (HLPF), four main steps have been taken to produce this Review: i) reviewing national social, economic and environmental conditions against the SDGs; ii) mapping and screening of governmental and non-governmental institutions to address the SDGs; iii) collecting relevant data from both government and non-governmental organizations; and vi) identifying organizations and actors with potential to contribute to achieving the SDGs in the three pillars of sustainability (economy, society, environment).  
       More specifically, literature reviews and semi-structured interviews with diverse stakeholders from governmental, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations within and outside the ROK have been used to collect data.    
       The Review addresses the implementation of the SDGs in the ROK and beyond, namely, the international implementation of the SDGs through the ROK’s international development cooperation. With regard to the implementation of the SDGs in the ROK, it describes the social, economic and environmental conditions of the ROK, identifying the SDGs most relevant to these conditions, and demonstrating institutions, policies and stakeholders for the implementation of those goals. Explaining the implementation of the SDGs in international development cooperation, the Review analyzes key ODA strategies of the ROK with a focus on their contributions to the SDGs.  
       The Review focuses on the identification of the laws, plans, policies and organizations directly related to the implementation of the SDGs. With regard to their impacts, it introduces findings from existing research and reports relevant to the SDGs.  For that purpose, various existing online and open information platforms from the government, academia and research communities and civil society have been used.  
III. Policy and Enabling Environment  
1. Creating ownership of the SDGs 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Environment have played a significant role in preparing for the implementation of the SDGs at home and abroad 
       As the government bodies that are respectively in charge of laws, decrees and special committees related to implementing the SDGs (such as the Sustainable Development Act, the Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) and the Committee for International Development Cooperation (CIDC), which will be explained in detail in the following sections), the MOFA and the MOE have played a significant role in creating national ownership of the SDGs. In addition, they have undertaken research, coordinated inter-ministry meetings and produced comprehensive reports for initial reviews for SDGs implementation in collaboration with academia. These initial reviews were conducted to make suggestions about: national policy priorities of the SDGs for domestic and international implementation, guidelines for governments and other stakeholders on how to pursue those goals and targets, the introduction of new policy instruments and business models and the adjustment of existing ones, organizational arrangements for implementing the SDGs, and policy assessment procedures. One of the main principles underpinning these activities was the aim of striking the right balance between staying close to the SDGs on the one hand, and reinterpreting the SDGs and their targets to make them fit better the national policy priorities on the other.  
       Further, in order to raise public awareness and create multiple-stakeholder ownership of the SDGs, the government has also encouraged the inclusion of the content addressing ODA and the SDGs in the textbooks for primary and secondary school students. At present, the Korea Foundation for Advancement of Science and Creativity, in association with the Ministry of Education, are supporting 40 teams of Teachers’ Research Association of Education for Sustainable Development, in which teachers and students voluntarily form groups to study sustainable development. The government is also carrying out national campaigns for the SDGs, and has expanded funds for sending more youth to the project sites of international development cooperation. In the meantime, the ROK government is making efforts to strengthen its communications with multiple stakeholders. With regard to climate change issues, for instance, the government has been paying particular attention to establishing a mechanism through which the government, business and civil society can consult with each other. As a case in point, civil society and the business sector are playing a significant role in drafting the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions for the UN and in creating rules and regulations on Emission Trading Schemes, and such efforts will be further strengthened. In addition, as the host country of UN Office for Sustainable Development under UN DESA, the ROK actively supports UN Member States in planning and implementing sustainable development strategies, notably through knowledge sharing, research, training and partnership building.  
 
Statistics Korea is continuing its efforts to provide sound statistical data for SDGs implementation  
 
       Statistics Korea has already established three mid- and long-term tasks for the implementation of the SDGs: the development of a framework for monitoring nationally relevant SDGs, research on methodologies to improve SDGs indicators in terms of scope and the provision of technical support for other government agencies to enhance their statistical capacity. As a first step, in collaboration with academia, it is currently reviewing existing official statistics and indicators to identify those that are most relevant to global indicators and to establish a national tier system of indicators. The existing main indicators include: the National Key Indicators, the Quality of Life Indicators, the e-Nara Indicators (sectoral key indicators in comparison with other countries), the Sustainable Development Indicators and the Green Growth Indicators. In parallel, Statistics Korea has established the framework for an online platform to promote the exchange of views on indicators among multiple stakeholders.  
 
The National Assembly has created a space for political and technical dialogue among national stakeholders 
       The National Assembly has played a significant role in creating a space for political and technical dialogue among national stakeholders, which is critical to creating national ownership of the SDGs. In 2014, the Special Committee on Sustainable Development was established with 18 members of the National Assembly. During the four months of its operation, the Committee proposed a position paper on the amendment of the Framework Act on Sustainable Development (2007). Although the Committee is convened temporarily, its position paper has initiated an ongoing discussion on the legal system related to sustainable development.  
       The Korea National Assembly UN SDGs Forum (herein the NSD), established in 2014, has engaged in diverse congressional activities related to the SDGs, including holding seven regular forums, launching two campaigns and visiting UN headquarters in New York. Such efforts will continue to develop practical and diverse global initiatives to create national ownership of the SDGs at the legislative institutional level. Also, the NSD will be launched as an official Legislative Research Organization of Korea National Assembly in July 2016. 
Local governments are actively involved in the dissemination of information and knowledge to local residents 
 
       In particular, some local governments with visions for sustainable development have undertaken various activities to raise awareness of the SDGs. A number of local governments, for instance, those of Seoul, Gwangju, Jeonju, Cheongju, Suwon, and Bupyeong District (Incheon), have voluntarily established implementation strategies for sustainable development at the local level and have drafted evaluation reports to measure their progress since 2010, which provides a strong basis for the implementation of the SDGs by local governments. Also, the number local governments in the ROK that are joining international networks of local governments interested in issues such as climate change, environment, cultural heritages, and human rights is increasing. Global partnership between cities for the implementation of the SDGs has also been actively pursued. In order to discuss the SDGs and targets related to urban issues, the Seoul Metropolitan government held the International Forum on Urban Policy for the SDGs in June 2016. It aimed to provide a global platform to support local action for the implementation of the SDGs. Combined with the policies and frameworks formulated by the central government, such contributions from local governments will create positive synergies to create ownership of SDGs both at national and local levels. 
The private sector focuses on environment, energy and Corporate Social Responsibility 
       The UN Global Compact Korea (herein the UNGC Korea) was established in 2007, and has been engaging in diverse activities to develop and promote local business practices that are more compatible with global development agenda, including the MDGs and the SDGs. The UNGC Korea has been dealing with a wide range of issues associated with the SDGs, including climate change, water and sanitation, human rights and corporate social responsibility (CSR), low-carbon green growth, working conditions, anti-corruption and transparency, and empowerment of women and youth. As of 2016, the UNGC Korea is composed of more than 280 companies of all sizes in both the public and private sectors. It has been particularly active in disseminating ideas on the implication of the SDGs for business and sharing the good practices of private companies’ actions to support for the SDGs. One of these practices includes an effort to use mobile communication networks to predict and prevent in advance the spread of infectious diseases. It is a private-sectorinitiated project that aims to build partnership among companies, national governments, and international organizations such as the United Nations. 
CSOs are creating ownership of the SDGs through activities to enhance mutual accountability 
       Since the 1992 Earth Summit, CSOs and the government, in particular at the local level, have engaged with each other to establish local agenda and actions for sustainable development. Many environmental CSOs working on the issues related to quality of life and environmental issues have engaged with policy processes in various ways. The actions of these environmental CSOs have been further promoted by the newly established comprehensive environmental protection laws and associated regulations.  
 
       Various CSOs aiming to contribute to implementing the SDGs are concerned with how to enhance transparency and accountability of the government policies. Such activities shaped the means for creating a wide range of channels for CSO ownership of the SDGs both on domestic and international fronts. In order to engage with the policy making process regarding the SDGs, a number of CSOs have analyzed the SDGs to identify priority goals and targets for national implementation. For instance, the Citizens’ Coalition for Economic Justice and the Sustainable Development Solutions Network Korea (herein SDSN-KOREA, established in 2013) respectively examined the SDGs against the economic, social, environmental and governance conditions in the ROK, trying to identify the goals and targets to which more attention should be paid in the ROK. By doing so, the SDSN-KOREA contributed to creating and strengthen national ownership of the SDGs as well as mutual accountability, one of the principles forming the foundation of partnership for the SDGs.  
 
       In addition, the Korean Civil Society Network for SDGs (herein the Network) was established in June 2016, by a number of local and national CSOs working on a wide range of issues related to the SDGs, including the economy, society, environment and governance, as well as gender equality and persons with disabilities. Creating a space for dialogue on the SDGs among CSOs, the Network actively facilitated consultations between the government and CSOs. The Network submitted its opinions of this Review to the government, and has also suggested that goals such as Goal 8 (safe workplace, labor, the right to work), Goal 10 (social, economic, and political inclusiveness, just legal system and practices), and Goal 16 (effective and reliable institution, open and democratic decision making, greater access to information and fair legal system) are the most urgent SDGs to be addressed in the ROK. 
2. Incorporation of the SDGs in national frameworks 
2.1. National Frameworks for Domestic Implementation 
 
The Third Basic Plan for Sustainable Development provides a basic platform to implement the Agenda 2030 
 
       The adoption of the Third Basic Plan for Sustainable Development 2016-2035 (herein the Third Plan) in January 2016 constitutes a vital component of the ROK’s efforts to translate the SDGs into national policies and plans. Specifically, the Third Plan has been drafted by analyzing the situations of the ROK and selecting the targets that are most relevant and urgent in the national context. Updated every five years, the Third Plan is inheriting the ROK’s longtime commitment to sustainable development and setting a basic platform to implement the international consensus on sustainable development. In addition, progress toward the policy targets of the Third Plan is evaluated biennially by the Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD).  
 
       The Third Plan aimed at integrating policy actions toward diverse factors that pose threats to national sustainability, such as the aggravation of climate change, the decline in biodiversity and the stagnation of economy. These factors were analyzed by taking into consideration the achievements and limitations of the Second Plan for Sustainable Development, which was adopted in 2011 and formed a basis to set up the Third Plan through the contributions of 26 line ministries. As a result, the Third Plan could provide 14 strategic targets around four overarching goal areas, setting the harmonious development of the environment, society and economy as its vision. The 14 strategic targets include, among others, high quality environmental service, promoting social unity and gender equality, inclusive growth and creation of decent jobs and strengthening of partnerships in implementing the 2030 Agenda. 
 
Healthy land: Making environmental conditions favorable to human development 
 
       This first goal contains 10 policy targets to make environmental conditions more favorable to human development. In order to make healthier environments, the ROK government will strengthen its land and urban management. Such measures include setting higher environment standards for ultrafine particles in tandem with the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria and promoting the supply of vehicles that are friendlier to the environment. In the meantime, it will enhance the quality of its ecosystem services by introducing a unified management system for licensing facilities that can cause pollution. In order to ensure biodiversity and clean water, forests, and mountains, the government will expand the green zones that are protected by relevant laws and regulations. 
 
Integrated and Safe Society: Efforts to build an inclusive society for better quality of life 
 
       The Integrated and Safe Society goal incorporates 16 policy targets to make society safer, more inclusive and integrated. Since socio-economic challenges in the ROK are rapidly emerging due to low fertility, ageing and the growing income gap, maintaining an inclusive and integrated society has become a vital issue that the ROK has to address for sustainable development. In recognition of the aforementioned socio-economic conditions in the ROK, the government will expand the supply rental homes for the less affluent and run specialized programs to support economic activities of youth and of women who interrupt their careers. In the same vein, the government will continue to encourage companies to have nursery facilities to look after their employees’ children. Adding to that, the government will strengthen its early response system to infectious diseases and preventive safety management of toxic chemical materials to make peoples’ life safer. 
 
Inclusive Creative Economy: A sustainable and robust economy for all 
 
       The Korean economy has shown miraculous, nearly unparalleled rates of economic growth and strong resilience to economic crises over the past decades. Nevertheless, the economy is facing several challenges. The slowing of the economy and the decrease in capital investment are in part attributable to the social phenomenon mentioned above, namely ageing and the country’s low birth rate. In order to meet such complex challenges that can hardly be fully addressed without integrating economic, social and environmental aspects of sustainability, the government will create more jobs by increasing positions in the public sector, providing financial support to private companies and promoting the operation of startup companies. The Inclusive Creative Economy goal encompasses 12 policy targets in similar contexts. The government will also set up a safe, sustainable energy system by supplying new and renewable energies and safely managing the operation of nuclear plants and radioactive waste. 
 
Global Responsibility: Strengthening partnership for the SDGs 
 
       Although the Third Plan mainly deals with domestic affairs, it covers eight policy targets related to international cooperation, as it was established jointly by 26 ministries. More details of the ROK’s efforts to implement the SDGs on the international front will be discussed in the following.  
 
Recently established policy frameworks and plans provide a coordination framework for the SDGs and targets 
       The ROK has continued its efforts to incorporate sustainable development concepts into its national and international development strategies since the 1990s. However, as the framework and details of the goals and targets of the SDGs were solidified, the necessity of building an institutional framework that can monitor and review the process of SDG implementation from a broader perspective that fully integrates diverse goals and targets became apparent.  
       Besides the Third Plan, there are a number of acts, policies and plans that are relevant in the implementation of the SDGs in the ROK. For instance, the 140 Government Policy and Governance Tasks (herein the Tasks), although established before the adoption of the SDGs, has considerable potential to provide a coherent framework to integrate the goals and targets associated with economic, social, environmental and governance issues. The Tasks include 42 economic development-, 52 social development-, 13 environment- and 23 governance-associated goals. The government elaborates policies to achieve these tasks in a way to create synergies with newly established policies and institutions for the SDGs. 
       In addition, since 2014 the government has been implementing the Three Year Plan for Economic Innovation, which aims at reforming the public sector, promoting a “Creative Economy” and boosting domestic demand. This plan targets SDGs that are mainly associated with social and economic development, such as a fair and efficient economy, growth through innovation and the balance between exports and domestic consumption. Its expected outcomes associated with welfare and income for youth, women and the elderly, economic participation, and a fair and transparent business environment are particularly conducive to achieving the SDGs related to economic and social development, such as Goal 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, and 17.  
       The ROK has also established a series of laws and policy proposals to respond to population ageing, particularly addressing the social and economic insecurity of people in various stages of their life course. These include: the Third Plan for Low Fertility and Ageing Society (2016-2020), the Framework Act on Low Fertility and Population Ageing (2014) and the Law for Promoting the Elderly-Friendly Industries (2013).  
       Last but not least, the government is paying close attention to the issue of gender equality. The Framework Act on Gender Equality (2015) and the Act on Promotion of Economic Activities of Career-Interrupted Women (2010) are in effect. Furthermore, the Framework Act on Gender Equality contains reinforced policies for gender equality, such as implementing quotas for administrative positions in public organizations and promoting the participation of women in decision making processes and in public, political and economic activities. Still, there is a room for improvement in this area. For instance, the ratio of managerial level female workers in the public sector was 11.55 percent (2013). When it came to high-ranking female officials (deputy director general level or above) in the government, the ratio dropped to 4.5 percent,. The aforementioned legal frameworks are expected to make contributions to promoting gender equality. 
Many existing mid- and long-term policy frameworks and plans for national development corresponds to the SDGs  
       A government think tank’s research has produced a rough summary about the links between existing and established policy frameworks and the 17 SDGs, which appear in Table 1 below.1 Although it is not an exhaustive list of plans and policies corresponding to the SDGs, it shows that many government plans are in place to address the SDGs.

Existing government policies and plans need to be fine-tuned and coordinated 
       The broad scope of goals and targets of the SDGs demonstrate that all government ministries and agencies should engage with the Goals and targets. Since every target requires the participation of more than one ministry or agency, multiple existing policies and plans are sometimes in place, dealing with same target of the SDGs. 
       Despite their direct and indirect relationships with the SDGs, these government policies and plans were established before the adoption of SDGs and need to be fine-tuned accordingly to integrate themselves with the whole of the SDG agenda. To this end, the government is making continuous efforts to harmonize polices and mainstream the SDGs so that they can address interlinked and indivisible SDGs and targets with full attention to tradeoffs, inter-linkages and complementarities between social, economic and environmental goals.   
2.2. National Frameworks for International Implementation  
 
       In order to incorporate the SDGs into national framework for the international development cooperation, the ROK government has established a number of policy frameworks and plans that are related to SDG implementation. They include: the Second Midterm ODA Policy 2016-2020 (herein the Second Policy), the President’s Initiatives for Development Cooperation (herein the Initiatives), the Strategy for Implementing Humanitarian Assistance (herein the Humanitarian Strategy) and the Multilateral Cooperation Strategy. 
Incorporation of the SDGs into national frameworks for international development and cooperation has shaped the key principles for ODA 
       The Second Policy sets the SDGs as the ROK’s ODA policy vision. Aiming at international development cooperation through a comprehensive approach and inclusive partnerships, the Second Policy has set three cardinal principles for the ROK’s ODA: integrating ODA for SDG implementation, building a robust framework for ODA and making ODA more inclusive.  
       Firstly, in order to achieve integrated ODA, the Second Policy has established a strong coordination mechanism to establish a coherent system to undertake projects for the SDGs. For instance, the government has established a new decision making process in which the International Development Cooperation Committee establishes comprehensive annual plans by gathering, coordinating, and approving various projects to better align them in a more coherent and concentrated manner. In accordance with the new principle, each ministry and agency in charge of ODA is requested to come up with annual ODA plans. In an effort to strengthen strategic cooperation between development cooperation agencies that are respectively in charge of grants and concessional loans projects, the government has established a consultative mechanism between the Office for Government Policy Coordination (OGPC), the MOFA, the Ministry of Strategy and Finance (MOSF) and government aid agencies such as the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) and the Export-Import Bank of Korea. The OGPC plays a role of coordinator in this consultative mechanism.  
       In addition, to maximize the advantage of global partnerships through the strategic selection of partners and the concentration of resources, the International Development Cooperation Committee, composed of the Prime Minister and ministers of relevant ministries, including the MOFA and MOSF, established the Country Partnership Strategy for the sustainable development of 24 prioritized countries.  
       Secondly, in order to build a robust framework for ODA, the government is examining its existing ODA programs by analyzing successful cases to derive lessons that can be applied to different regions, situations and various demands from development partners. In the meantime, the organizational structure of KOICA has been changed with increased manpower to enhance its project management and ODA program development capacity.  
       In order to guarantee systematic evaluation of ODA programs, the government has made it mandatory for all national agencies for international development cooperation to undertake evaluation of implementation of projects twice per fiscal year, and has established a new mechanism to check the contribution of projects with regard to achieving the SDGs. From 2016, each ministry and agency carrying out various ODA projects is requested to specify the SDGs and targets that are relevant to the particular projects submitted. At least 70 percent of the projects submitted had relevance to achieving the SDGs, according to a recent survey by the Committee for International Development Cooperation (herein, CIDC). In addition, the Korean government will enhance the transparency of ODA by submitting relevant information on ODA projects in a timely manner to the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) from 2016, beginning with thirteen elements of information with a view to promote effectiveness and predictability of development cooperation. It will also try to gradually expand coverage and quality of ODA data, and increase the number of agencies to provide information on ODA. 
       Thirdly, in order to make ODA more inclusive, and maximize synergies between diverse actors from both public and non-governmental sectors, the government has established the principle of “Inclusive ODA” and facilitated the participation of the private sector via various programs. For instance, the Development Action Program, an innovative approach to bolster public-private partnership, acts as a platform on which multiple stakeholders, such as civil society organizations, business communities and academics, can cooperate with each other to develop creative approaches using new technologies and business models. In addition, KOICA is running various thematic programs that are designed to nurture public-private partnerships in several fields, including those related to the environment, education, governance and other development issues.  
  
The President’s Initiatives for Development Cooperation to address the SDGs through tangible ODA programs 
            With the adoption of the 2030 Agenda, President Park Geun-hye has announced a series of Initiatives for Development Cooperation in order to make tangible contributions to the global community in achieving the SDGs. At the 24th Committee for International Development Cooperation (CIDC), the Master Plan for the Initiatives was adopted in order to carry out these Initiatives effectively. The Master Plan also lays out concrete strategies regarding partnerships, the selection of core partners and step-by-step approaches for the implementation of the Initiatives.  
       The President’s Initiatives for Development and Cooperation are particularly notable since specific SDGs are addressed by concrete ODA programs. The Better Life for Girls Initiative focuses on girls’ education and health in developing countries, which are critical for achieving several SDGs, including Goal 3 (good health), Goal 4 (quality education) and Goal 5 (gender equality). This is based on the recognition that, despite substantial progress toward achieving the MDGs for women and girls, infant mortality and maternal health still must be addressed. The aspiration for women’s and girls’ empowerment is deserving because it is crucial in achieving several SDGs. More specifically, girls who receive a quality education are more likely to delay marriage and childbirth, achieve greater income and productivity, and raise fewer, healthier and better-educated children, thus passing along these positive social benefits to the next generation. Equally important in empowering girls is their access to adequate healthcare and a positive learning environment. Girls in good health are more likely to stay in school and therefore be better prepared for the workplace, which leads to greater socio-economic opportunities. Education and health are inherently connected for girls’ empowerment and are in turn linked to gender equality. Girls who benefit from these initiatives are more likely to grow up to make free and informed decisions and to become equal partners and decision-makers in their households and communities. With such rationale, the Better Life for Girls Initiative aims to accord targeted attention to supporting girls’ education, health and professional development. As emphasized in the 2030 Agenda, the approach will be distinctly holistic and gender-focused for girls’ empowerment. 
       The Better Life for Girls Initiative comprises the following three pillars: Girls’ Right to Education, Girls’ Right to Health and Girls’ Right to a Profession. The pillar of Girls’ Right to Education focuses on providing effective education for learning outcomes, and providing inclusive education for marginalized groups. Effective education for learning outcomes promotes quality education through capacity building for teachers and the use of ICT in learning. Inclusive education for marginalized groups provides education opportunities for girls from disadvantaged social backgrounds who are out of school and those in crisis and post-conflict situations. The pillar of Girls’ Right to Health aims to support healthy schools for girls and promote youth-friendly community health services. Healthy schools for girls focus on strengthening life skills-based sexual and reproductive health education and improving school hygiene. Youth-friendly community health services promote community gender awareness and serves to further the provision of these services in the community. The pillar of Girls’ Right to a Profession focuses on promoting skills and technology for work, and life skills for empowerment. The aim is to promote equal opportunities for technical and vocational education and training for girls, seeking to link learning with employment. Efforts in this pillar also focus on enhancing girls’ skills to enable them to gain better jobs and entrepreneurship opportunities, teaching them to think critically and make independent decisions. 
 
       The Safe Life for All Initiative is a manifestation of the ROK’s strong commitment to act to ensure a safe world and was set forth on the occasion of the Global Health Security Agenda High-level Meeting held in Seoul in September 2015. The Safe Life for All Initiative is a reaffirmation of Seoul Declaration, which is a demonstration of the shared vision for a safe and secure world free from all forms of infectious disease threats, and directly addresses SDGs like Goal 3. As observed in the recent outbreak of Ebola, MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) and the spread of the Zika virus, infectious diseases are problems that know no boundaries and can constitute a public health crisis anywhere, and that have significant social, economic and political implications on the national, regional and international scale. Through this Initiative, the ROK will work with the ministries of health of partner countries to render support for programs related to strengthening national capacity for disease control and prevention, immunization, disease surveillance, epidemiological investigation, personnel training and national infectious disease diagnostic laboratory systems. This Initiative tries to identify country-specific situations and needs to provide tailored assistance to meet the needs of and bridge the gaps in specific countries. 
       The 2030 Agenda places great emphasis on science, technology and innovation (STI) as the key means for sustainable development, as demonstrated in Goal 17. Importantly, many developing countries have difficulties in effectively harnessing the potential of STI to generate sustainable, endogenous growth. Businesses and organizations in these countries understandably find it difficult to develop their technological capacity, which in turn hampers investment in research and development (R&D). The major stumbling blocks causing these shortcomings are the lack of awareness of the importance of STI and the inadequate R&D capacity of universities and research institutes. The ROK’s STI for Better Life Initiative aims to establish and develop an appropriate innovations system—by supporting science and technology education—to strengthen the R&D capacity in developing countries. The Initiative addresses the SDGs, such as Goal 4 (quality education), Goal 9 (infrastructure), and Goal 17 (global partnerships). The STI for Better Life Initiative comprises three approaches, including STI education, R&D support and private sector assistance. It also emphasizes inclusive partnerships as envisioned through cooperation with civil society organizations, universities, and businesses in partner countries; partnership with the Center for Creative Economy and Innovation , science and technology research institutes and businesses in the ROK; triangular cooperation among partner countries with help from innovation programs of other donor countries; and collaboration with multilateral organizations worldwide. 
        A New Paradigm for Rural Development focuses on developing countries’ rural development, which is crucial to achieving the SDGs, particularly Goal 1 (end poverty) and 2 (end hunger and promote sustainable agriculture). It is an attempt to globally share the lessons drawn from the Saemaul Undong, a program that significantly contributed to reducing urban-rural disparity during the ROK’s rapid economic and social development period. Such lessons include Saemaul Spirit (diligence, self-help and cooperation), the importance of fair incentive and competition schemes, trust-based leadership and the active and voluntary engagement of the people. The Saemaul Undong program as a rural development model is composed of ingredients for success, such as a multi-sectoral approach, an incentive-based mechanism promoting competition, village level development, Saemaul Undong education tailored to the needs of each community, partnership, appropriate technology and an expanding value chain. In a nutshell, the ROK government is making an effort to apply the Saemaul Undong strategy to the implementation of the SDGs in developing countries by (1) elaborating concepts and theories associated with Saemaul Undong and mapping them to the SDGs, (2) designing and managing education and training courses on Saemaul Undong, (3) conducting national and thematic reviews of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda from the perspective of Saemaul Undong and (4) scaling up Saemaul Undong vertically, horizontally and transversally.  
 
According to a recent Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 
(OECD) report, A New Rural Development Paradigm for the 21st Century: A Toolkit for Developing Countries, Saemaul Undong was a multi-dimensional and multi-sectoral strategy that buffered large-scale migration from rural to urban areas and the increasing rural-urban income gap during the time of industrialization. The ROK is committed to sharing the lessons for the development of rural areas where, globally, more than three billion people live in less favorable conditions compared to their urban counterparts in terms of access to education, medical services and other basic infrastructures. In this regard, the Special High-Level Event on Saemaul Undong on the occasion of the Development Summit 2015, which was chaired by the ROK President Park Geun-hye herself and joined by heads of states and international organizations, was a very meaningful occasion in scaling up the ROK’s rural development model into a shared resource for all. By renovating and reinvigorating Saemaul Undong, the Initiative makes an effort to develop the Initiative in a way that fits local contexts and addresses the needs of developing countries in different situations. At the High-Level Event, which was convened on the occasion of the UN Development Summit in September 2015, it has been argued that the success of the globalization of Saemaul Undong should pay special attention to local ownership, democratic governance, environmentally sound projects and livelihood sustainability. 
       At the High-Level Event, some pointed out that there is no clear definition of Saemaul Undong ODA and that the various ministries are not carrying out Saemaul Undong in a coordinated manner. In order to address such issues, the CIDC has adopted, in April 2016, a new strategy to promote Saemaul Undong in the global context. The new strategy provides concrete measures regarding the localization of Saemaul Undong, the procedures to carry out Saemaul Undong projects, the division of labor within the government, and partnerships with various stakeholders. 
The Strategy for Implementing Humanitarian Assistance contributes to a holistic and fundamental approach on a global scale to overcome humanitarian crises  
       Goal 16 of the SDGs particularly emphasizes a holistic and fundamental approach on the global scale to overcoming the humanitarian crises of the 21st century. In order to contribute to the global efforts to respond to humanitarian crises, the ROK has placed its policy priority on its “Humanitarian Diplomacy.” In this regard, the ROK has doubled its total humanitarian assistance and increased its humanitarian assistance for refugees by tenfold over the past five years. 
       Taking a comprehensive and holistic approach to resolve global challenges such as frequent natural disasters and lingering political instabilities, the ROK also came up with the Strategy for Humanitarian Assistance in 2015, containing Korea’s vision, core principles and action plans for humanitarian assistance, which was adopted by the CIDC, consisting of the Prime Minister and ODA-related ministers. 
       According to the strategy, the ROK puts priority on providing assistance to the most vulnerable groups, such as children, women and refugees, with focuses on public health and education where the ROK has comparative advantage from its development experience. Trying to enhance efficiency and effectiveness of its humanitarian assistance, the ROK aims to strengthen the humanitarian-development nexus especially by aligning its humanitarian assistance with the Initiatives such as the Better Life for Girls Initiative.  
       The ROK has acknowledged the fact that the root causes that feed terrorism and conflicts should be tackled to resolve the recent protracted conflicts and humanitarian crises. However, humanitarian assistance cannot be a perfect replacement for political solutions that can prevent the occurrence of and reoccurrence of conflicts. With such recognition, the ROK will continue to increase its contributions to the conflict prevention and peacebuilding.  
The Multilateral Cooperation Strategy has been established to strengthen the linkages between multilateral partnership and bilateral cooperation, and increase development effectiveness  
       Global issues like humanitarian crisis, climate change and natural disasters pose grave threats to sustainability. Such challenges are often trans-boundary, causing environmental, social and economic impacts that are not limited to a specific area and require global and mutual accountability, responsibility and response. Therefore, forging a global partnership that embraces not only states but also multilateral organizations with specialties and expertise in their respective fields has become necessary. In order to meet these needs, the ROK has established a comprehensive Multilateral Cooperation Strategy.  
       The Multilateral Strategy reflects the Second Policy and the results of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) Peer Review and seeks to create synergies between bilateral and multilateral development projects in a mutually reinforcing way, enhance the efficiency of multilateral cooperation by selecting the right organization for the right project as a partner, support developing countries’ implementation efforts for the SDGs, make contributions to prevent and resolve global crises, and strengthen multiple-stakeholder partnerships. Concrete measures regarding the selection of priority organizations, improving monitoring of Trust Funds set up at international organizations, and enhancing the cooperation mechanism between ministries are laid out in the Strategy. As of 2014, the Multilateral Strategy aligns diverse cooperative projects from 25 ministries and agencies that undertake multilateral cooperative projects with 74 international agencies in a more coherent and synergy-creating manner so as to make multilateral cooperation enhance the effectiveness of multilateral cooperation, and consequently contribute to achieving the SDGs.  
3. Integration of the three dimensions  
 
       Policy frameworks for implementing the SDGs in both domestic and international development cooperation integrate the three dimensions of the SDGs, that is, social, economic and environmental dimensions with their own distinctive strategies.  
 
The Third Basic Plan for Sustainable Development as a key plan for the SDGs integrates the three dimension of the SDGs with its four goals 
 
       Envisioning the harmonious development of the environment, society and the economy, the Third Plan has established four major goal areas in the spheres of environment, society, economy and international cooperation with 14 strategies and 50 tasks for the implementation of the four areas.  
 
       The Third Plan has expanded its scope to encompass economic and social development goals, particularly including: health and well-being (SDG 3), education (SDG 4), gender equality (SDG 5), good jobs and economic growth (SDG 8), inequality (SDG 10), and sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11). It pays more attention to those areas which have shown visible regress, particularly environmental areas. The Third Plan especially deals with: sources of energy, renewable energy, women’s economic participation, gender wage gaps and the ratio of ODA to GNI. It also acknowledges that less attention should be paid to those targets which have already reached advanced levels, such as life expectancy, the under-5 mortality rate, basic education and access to the Internet. The emerging social concerns, such as the income gap, regional disparities, unemployment, low fertility and ageing, were taken into consideration.  
 
       Compared to the Second Plan, the Third Plan pays extra attention to strengthening the integration of the three pillars of the SDGs: environmental, social and economic development. For instance, the strategy to promote social inclusion and gender equality is expected to address SDG 1 (No poverty), SDG 4 (Quality education), SDG 5 (Gender equality) and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequality). Complementarity among the strategies creates a synergy in addressing specific SDGs. For instance, by enacting the Act on Liability for Environmental Damage and Relief and strengthening its proactive management of toxic chemical agents, the Third Plan integrated social and environmental aspects of sustainable development. Enhanced employment conditions for temporary employees and harmonious development of large and small companies are in consideration to link social and economic aspects of development. In such ways, the Third Plan tries to integrate the diverse aspects of sustainable development. The fourteen strategies of the Third Plan are addressing the SDGs as follows.

ODA policy focus on cross-cutting issues addresses the three dimensions of SDGs in a holistic and integrated manner 
The ROK’s ODA policies and projects, including the Second Policy and the President’s Initiatives for Development Cooperation, integrate the three dimensions of the SDGs.  For instance, each of the Initiatives is related to multiple SDG Goals, dealing with multiple aspects of sustainability. The Better Life for Girls Initiatives addresses the SDGs, including Goals 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 17; the Safe Life for All, Goals 3, 6; the STI for Better Life, Goals 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 17; and the New Rural Development Paradigm, Goals 1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 17. The Better Life for Girls Initiative, for example, tries to find the interrelated and complex cause of the challenges facing girls’ empowerment. Regarding girls’ education, despite global progress toward the achievement of universal primary school education, many girls are still out of school or struggling to stay in school. Many of them often face unsafe walks or violence on the way to school. Many girls in developing countries are forced into marriages in which they cannot exercise any rights in making free and responsible reproductive choices. Furthermore for many girls, technologies and tools essential for work are out of reach. The Better Life for Girls Initiative recognizes such complexity and aims to address these multiple challenges, contributing to achieving the multiple SDGs associated with them. On the other hand, the New Rural Development Paradigm deals with economic, social and environmental issues which are the causes of urban-rural disparity in developing countries. The challenges to the SDGs are often both causes and the results of underdevelopment at the same time, and these initiatives are trying to contribute to achieving several SDGs that are integrated with each other in specific contexts.  
       The Humanitarian Assistance Strategy of the ROK is focusing on those affected by humanitarian crisis. It particularly pays attention to humanitarian disasters, which cause setback to long-term economic and social development of affected countries. In these countries, the lack of adequate relief infrastructures and resources tends to inflict massive causalities more frequently. The Humanitarian Assistance Strategy aims to address the linkages between humanitarian assistance and development cooperation that are critical in preventing the recurrence of humanitarian crises and strengthening the resilience of a society in humanitarian crisis settings. By creating a space where emergency relief and development assistance can create synergies, it integrates short-term and long-term strategies of the three dimensions of the SDGs in the crisis-affected areas. It is also important to ensure the principle of leaving no one left behind globally, and will be discussed further in the thematic analysis section of the Review. 
 4. Goals and targets  
 
       The inter-ministerial processes to assess the progress and status of nationallydefined goals for sustainable development by the First Basic Plan for Sustainable Development 2006-2010 (established in 2006) and the Second Basic Plan for Sustainable Development 2011-2015 (established in 2011) have been undertaken since the early 2000s. In particular, the Committee for Sustainable Development (CSD) has undertaken the evaluation of 77 indicators to evaluate the achievements and status of goals (25 indicators for social development, 25 indicators for the economy and 27 indicators for the environment) every two years since 2006. The following table shows the results based on the evaluation of these 77 indicators undertaken in 2015. 
Table	3.	Status	of	the	Indicators	for	the	Second	Basic	Plan	for	Sustainable	Development	
 Total Environment Society Economy Progress 40 10 16 14 Regress 24 13 5 6 Total 64* 23 21 20 * Out of 77 indicators, 11 indicators which are not performance indicators have been excluded. Two indicators were unavailable. 
       According to the report, environmental development had more indicators that showed regression compared to those of economic and social development. For instance, the ROK was at the highest level in terms of the volume of greenhouse gas emissions among OECD countries, except for those rich in natural resources. The size of park areas in metropolitan cities was also small in comparison with that of advanced countries.  
       While there was overall improvement in poverty reduction, gender equality, life expectancy and education, deterioration trends in the income ratio of regular to non-regular employment, the ratio of government expenditure on health, and in the crime ratio were observed. Also, despite some enhancement, the indicators related to work hours and gender inequality showed less favorable environments in the ROK compared to other OECD countries.   
       Regarding economic development, visible signs of improvement were seen in the indicators related to economic growth, transportation and information technology. However, the economic growth rate and the investment rate were not at a satisfactory level in comparison with the rest of the OECD.   
       The indicators used for the aforementioned report were broadly correlated to the SDGs, but do not exactly coincide with the SDGs. In response to the newly established SDG indicators from the United Nations Statistics Committee, the CSD is in the middle of a process to reestablish 84 indicators reflecting the SDGs’ targets and indicators (see Table 4). Given that all 230 (241) SDG indicators2 do not necessarily reflect the specific economic, social and environmental conditions of the ROK, it will take more time to establish national indicators that fully incorporate the SDGs to meet the national context of the ROK.

5. Thematic analysis 
 
The principle of “leaving no one behind” is at the core of most government policies and plans  
 
       All government policies and plans have been designed and implemented with attention to the principle of universal application of benefits to all, and thus, it is fair to say that the principle of “leaving no one behind” underpins the ROK’s policies and initiatives to implement the SDGs.  
 
       In particular, the 140 Government Policy and Governance Tasks, the Three Year Plan for Economic Innovation (herein the Plan for Economic Innovation), and the Third Plan address a wide range of issues related to economic, social and environmental development and governance issues with specific focus on the poor and marginalized. When they are effectively implemented, these plans and policies are expected to contribute to achieving targets of Goal 8, related to sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all; of Goal 10, related to the reduction of inequality within country; and of Goal 16, related to peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provision of access to justice for all, and building effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels. Since the Third Plan was reviewed in the previous sections, the Review focuses on the Tasks and the Plan for Economic Innovation and other related policies in this section. 
The 140 Government Policy and Governance Tasks 
 
       The Tasks lays out four visions, which include the revitalization of the economy, the happiness of the people, the prosperity of the culture and the establishment of the foundation for peaceful unification, provide a comprehensive set of 140 goals that the government has to address in order to ensure the realization of these visions. To do so, the ROK government is proposing 14 strategies and various policies for social cohesion that aim at extending helping hands to those left behind from the gains and benefits of societal development.   
    For instance, tailored employment and social welfare, which is one of the 14 strategies, has 23 targets to be achieved for ensuring the happiness of the people. Such targets include tailored basic livelihoods that fits the needs of the recipients, equal treatment for irregular workers, strengthened supporting for job seekers and creating more jobs in the welfare service sector. In order to expand welfare service sector, to give an example, the Tasks aim to create positive synergies between employment and welfare. Based on a series of mapping exercises to analyze the welfare service sector, the government hired more workers in public welfare centers. Adding to that, the government provided financial supports to raise the overall wage level and enhanced working conditions, and introduced various incentive schemes in the welfare service sector. By adopting such a holistic approach to build an inclusive society that ensures happiness for all, the Tasks is fully incorporating the principle of “leaving no one behind.” 
 
The Three Year Plan for Economic Innovation 
 
       The Plan for Economic Innovation focuses on a strategy for strengthening social safety net for those who risk being left behind in the process of economic innovation and increasing the employment of women and youth. For instance, the Plan for Economic Innovation aims to strengthen the foundation for gender equality and encourage women’s participation in economic activities. The Ministry of Gender Equality and Family and the Ministry of Employment and Labor have established policies to promote women’s career development and provide child care services for female workers. They particularly address the gender equality in employment by imposing strong regulations to ensure maternity leave and the mandatory provision of child care service by companies with more than 500 employees.  
 
       Another example regarding the “leave no one behind” principle can be found in the government’s efforts to increase job opportunities for youth, whose high unemployment rate poses a challenge to ensuring the principle. The government is currently reforming the vocational training and education system at the upper secondary level and above, utilizing the National Competency Standards, a system that scientifically systemizes evaluation mechanisms for job competencies by analyzing knowledge, technology and aptitude. This system is complemented by the Comprehensive Policy Response to the Young Adults’ Employment Cliff (2015), which aims at creating 88,000 regular jobs - 53,000 in the public sector and 35,000 in the private sector - and 125,000 part-time jobs in partnership with businesses over the next three years. These policies are expected to contribute to increasing the labor income share relative to capital income and will create synergies with the strategy for social inclusion.  
 
Efforts to ensure that no one is left behind on the domestic front: (1) Ageing population 
 
       The population of the ROK is ageing rapidly and as a result, the size of workforce is shrinking. In 2018, it is estimated that the share of population aged 65 and older will reach 14 percent. This raises several social questions regarding the policy implication of the increasing burden of care for the elderly, the high probability of youth unemployment, and the welfare of the elderly in the 21st century. The most serious problem that the ROK is faced with in such a situation is the increase in the elderly poverty rate, which is at 49.6 percent, quadrupling the OECD average of 12.6 percent in 2015. The impact of the ageing population is unevenly concentrated in rural areas in which about 41 percent of the elderly population in the ROK resides. The average annual growth rate of elderly population in rural areas is 37.3 percent, which is triple the national average of 12.2 percent and leads to declining productivity in these areas and, consequently, contributes to income gap between urban and rural communities.  
 
       In response, the government has established a series of laws and policy proposals to respond to the ageing population, with special attention to structural issues like the relationship between ageing and fertility, as well as the welfare of the elderly. These laws include the Third Plan for Low Fertility and Ageing Society (2015), the Framework Act on Low Fertility and Population Ageing (2014), and the Law for Promoting Elderly-Friendly Industries (2013). The policies based on these laws and plans include the establishment of hospice care for the elderly at home, the increase in the number of social workers for those with Alzheimer’s disease, the increase of public care facilities for the elderly and the increase of tailor-made public works for the elderly. With regard to the issue of social reproduction, which is a fundamental cause of the ageing society, polices have been established for the coverage of medical costs related to pregnancy, ante- and post-natal care, the provision of low-cost housing for newly married couple, the increase in public child care facilities and the increase in the among of time and incentives for parental leave.   
Efforts to ensure that no one is left behind on the domestic front: (2) Persons with disabilities 
       Since 1998, the government has established the Comprehensive Plan of Policies for Persons with Disabilities (CPPPD) every five years. The Comprehensive Plan reflects inputs from a series of hearings and consultations including experts and CSOs working for the rights of persons with disabilities. Almost all ministries have implemented policies for persons with disabilities to provide welfare benefits, employment services, IT facilities, special education, access to sports, culture and leisure facilities and media.  
 
       The ROK ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) in 2008, and adopted the Incheon Strategy, composed of regionally-agreed disabilityinclusive development goals, comprised of 10 goals, 27 targets and 62 indicators in 2012. Since then, the ROK has played a leading role in implementing these goals. The government is currently implementing 19 tasks and 71 sub-tasks within the framework of the Fourth CPPPD (2013-2017), which focuses on welfare and health, education and culture, economic activities, the promotion of rights and participation. Policies and monitoring and evaluation activities for the implementation of these tasks are coordinated by the Coordination Committee of Policies for Persons with Disabilities, which is under the Prime Minister’s Office.3  
 
       The ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2008, and a number of laws including the Anti-Discrimination Against and Remedies for Persons with Disabilities Act (herein the Anti-Discrimination Act), which came into force in May 2010, demonstrate the ROK’s strong commitment to the rights of persons with disabilities. In particular, the Anti-Discrimination Act ensures equal treatment of persons with disabilities in employment, education, the provision and use of goods and services, judicial and administrative procedures, services and political rights and many other aspects of human life that affect the welfare of persons with disabilities. The Anti-Discrimination Act also puts emphasis on the rights of women and children with disabilities by setting separate articles regarding these groups. The Acts on Welfare of Persons with Disabilities, Welfare Support for Children with Disabilities, and Activity Assistant Services for Persons with Disabilities are also cases in point.  
 
       The government has particularly improved the system for service delivery to persons with disabilities, whose number reached 2.5 million in 2014 (about five percent of the total population), by introducing a welfare needs assessment at the early phase of registration. The government has relaxed the medical requirements to receive benefits by reflecting experts’ opinions from the community of persons with disabilities and strengthened its support for the rehabilitation and social participation of people with disabilities. More housing services and an increased quota for mandatory employment also reflect the ROK government’s commitment to leaving no one behind. In particular, the Fourth Comprehensive Plan for the Employment of Persons with Disabilities (2013 -2017) aims at increasing the number jobs for persons with disabilities, enhancing services that meet the specific needs of the individuals, and building infrastructure for a barrier-free society.  
 
Efforts to ensure that no one is left behind on the global front: (1) Humanitarian Assistance 
       In order to mainstream the principle of leaving no one behind in the implementation process of the SDGs in international development cooperation, the ROK places top priority on the most vulnerable groups, such as children, women, and refugees in crisis settings, and has been expanding its contributions to this end. Over the past five years, the ROK has doubled its total humanitarian assistance for supporting the victims of natural disasters and lingering political instabilities. In particular, the prolongation of conflicts has led the ROK government to increase the volume of humanitarian assistance for refugees tenfold, making the total amount of the ROK’s humanitarian assistance to 100 million dollars.  
 
       The ROK has established the Humanitarian Assistance Multilateral Cooperation Office, which is in charge of carrying out the humanitarian aid projects of the ROK government. The Office constantly monitors disaster occurrences worldwide and provides aid through appropriate means based on damage level, aid delivery speed and the specific needs of the affected area. The ROK government will continue its efforts to increase the size of its humanitarian assistance and enhance the effectiveness of this assistance.  
 
Efforts to ensure that no one is left behind on the global front: (2) Financial Inclusion 
       Increasing access to financial services holds important implications for inclusive growth. With growing interest in enhancing the financial access of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in developing countries, the ROK has been assisting these SMEs through an impact investment project, which contributes to the special fund designed to improve their financial access. Going forward, the ROK plans to contribute to realizing financial inclusiveness by implementing projects to build payment and settlement systems that could help populations in developing countries have greater access to basic financial services, such as opening accounts and automatic transfers. The ROK will also play a more visible role in improving financial access of vulnerable groups in developing countries. To this end, the ROK plans to promote financial literacy of girls, one of the most vulnerable groups in developing countries, by teaching them accounting in accordance with the Better Life for Girls Initiative. 
6. Institutional mechanisms 
 
       In order to implement the 2030 Agenda, the ROK has established a series of institutional mechanisms for domestic and international implementation of the SDGs, which are mutually reinforcing.  
Mechanisms for national and local implementation of the SDGs are in place 
       The Korean government’s concern for sustainable development with a particular focus on the environment began with the Earth Summit in 1992. After the Earth Summit, the government established the National Action Plan to implement the Rio Agenda 21 in 1996 and the Presidential Commission on Sustainable Development (herein PCSD) in 2000. The Presidential Declaration of 2005, “A National Vision for Sustainable Development,” the goal of which was to continue the growth of the ROK as “an advanced country while maintaining balance between economy, society and the environment,” clearly resonates the integrative approach of the 2030 Agenda to sustainable development. In 2007, the PCSD also cohosted the Conference on National Sustainable Development Strategy in the Asia Pacific Region, in which the national strategies for sustainable development in the region were peer-reviewed.  
 
       It is particularly notable that civil society organizations, media, academia and the business sector played a significant role in establishing the PCSD through their firm request to the government to establish a national institution addressing sustainable development. Since its inception, the PCSD has played an advisory role in shaping the policies and plans for national sustainable development. The PCSD’s role includes integrating economic, social and environmental policies, planning and implementing international conventions on environmental and sustainable development such as the Rio Agenda 21 and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. With the inputs from its special committees, the PCSD developed sectoral strategies for sustainable development in various areas (energy, water, gender, social welfare, land, climate change, transportation, conflict management and ODA) and integrated them into national policies through effective coordination and consensus-building processes among different line ministries.   
 
       After the establishment of the Framework Act on Sustainable Development (2007), the legal basis of the PCSD changed from Presidential Decree to the Framework Act on Sustainable Development. It implies that legal status, authority and capacity of the PCSD has become stronger than the previous Committee, whose legal status was based on Presidential Decree.   
 
       A series of the government policies and plans, with many goals and targets closely associated with sustainable development, has been established. The adoption of the Framework Act on Low Carbon and Green Growth (2010) established the Presidential Commission on Green Growth (herein the PCGG) in 2010, and then accordingly the PCSD became the CSD, a ministerial committee under Ministry of Environment in the same year. The PCGG aimed at promoting industries for environmentally-friendly green growth and job creation. The CSD, in accordance with Article 14 of the Sustainable Development Act, prepares a biennial report, in which it consolidates the results of national sustainability evaluations, and which it publishes after reporting to the President of the ROK. The biennial report is also submitted to the National Assembly. The CSD and other relevant government ministries and agencies are currently deliberating on ways to incorporate the SDG indicators into the evaluation conducted by this biennial report.   
 
       The establishment of the Guideline for Evaluation of Sustainability and Living Infrastructure of Cities in 2014 is another case in point and is particularly notable in that the government has demonstrated its strong commitment to implementing sustainable development. The Guideline provides a framework for the evaluation of the local governments’ progress on sustainable development, in particular urban planning for SDGs, which is broadly in line with the New Urban Agenda of Habitat III.  
 
       Even before the establishment of the Framework Act on Sustainable Development (which became the Sustainable Development Act in 2010), after the Earth Summit many local governments, in particular provincial governments, began to establish LCSDs based on public sector–civil society partnership. As of 2016, 100 out of 243 local governments in the ROK have established LCSDs. After the establishment of the Framework Act for Green Growth, the Local Green Growth Committees and the LCSDs, in particular the latter, have played the role of the main agencies for implementing the SDGs at local level. The LCSDs has been developing a process to further promote sustainable development over the last 20 years, and now implements policies directly related to the SDGs at the local level by analyzing and aligning existent projects in the context of the SDGs. 
       The Local Sustainability Alliance of Korea (herein the LSAK) established in 2000 as a nation-wide network of LCSDs, has been a vital institutional platform to ensure the participation of LCSDs in policy dialogues for the SDGs at national level. The LSAK, has also played a significant role in building the capacity of LCSDs in policy and implementation of sustainable development through National Conference on Sustainable Development, Policy Forums and Sustainable Development Best Practice Award in cooperation with MOE. The LCSDs, a local partnership organization composed of governments and multi-stakeholders, is a notable example of multi-stakeholder partnership for the implementation of the SDGs at the local level. 
Institutional mechanisms for international implementation of the SDGs have been established  
       The Committee for International Development Cooperation (CIDC) is composed of the Prime Minister, Ministers of relevant ministries, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) and Ministry of Strategy and Finance (MOSF), and the heads of the relevant government agencies and various stakeholders such as academics, researchers, and other non-governmental actors. The CIDC acts as the control tower for the ROK’s ODA policy that is committed to the implementation of the SDGs. 
       Initially established under the Prime Minister’s Office in 2006, the CIDC’s legal status was strengthened in 2010 when the Framework Act for International Development promoted it to the top government organization for making policy decisions on international development. Coordinating concessional loan-based projects led by the MOSF and grant-based projects led by the MOFA, the CIDC has established a process of coordinating a wide range of plans and policy frameworks particularly relevant to SDGs. They include: coordination and planning for the Busan High Level Forum for Aid Effectiveness, planning the follow-up process for Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation (GPEDC), monitoring implementation indicators of the GPEDC, establishing a comprehensive plan for the implementation of development cooperation projects, and the establishment of the Second Policy for International Development and Cooperation.  
       CSOs are acting as important partners by delivering policy deliberations to the government through public-private partnership programs, such as the Development Action Program. They are also actively monitoring and evaluating government policies. For instance, the Citizens’ Coalition for Economic Justice, the Sustainable Development Solution Network Korea, the Korea Civil Society Forum on International Development Cooperation, the Global Call to Action Against Poverty Korea and the Korea NGO Council for Overseas Development Cooperation have been particularly active in policy dialogues with the government.  
IV. Means of Implementation 
 
Efforts are made to mobilize financial means of implementation of the SDGs through 4 domestic policies 
 
       Strengthening domestic resource mobilization by expanding government revenue is central to securing the financial means for SDG implementation. Tax revenue per capita in 2014 was 6,882 USD, far lower than the OECD average of 14,920 USD. The macro tax burden ratio, that is, the tax burden to gross domestic product, was 20.2 percent in 2012, which was lower than the average of the OECD of 25 percent, but higher than those of Japan (16.8 percent), Singapore (13.8 percent), Taiwan, Province of China (12.9 percent) and Hong Kong, China (14.2 percent). The ROK government is making an effort to secure the means of implementation through mid-term tax policy with emphasis on a more efficient tax system to strengthen the growth engine, enhance tax fairness and secure a stable tax base. In addition, the government is actively exploring ways to tap into new and innovative sources of finance that can be stable and reliable financial sources for SDG implementation.  
																																																								
4 Means of implementation can be presented as two broad sets of modalities and instruments. First, the means of implementation can be distinguished from the perspective of key instruments: financial and other (non-financial). Second, they may be considered from the perspective of jurisdiction or level of operation: global and national policies and institutions, although some may be regional. In this paragraph reviewing the means of implementation for domestic implementation of the SDGs, we mainly focus on financial means.  
 
The ROK will aim at increasing the total volume of ODA so that it reaches 0.2 percent of GNI by 2020 
       ODA should remain as an important development resource in the SDG era, especially for less affluent and vulnerable countries with special needs. As such, the ROK will continue to increase its ODA. The Second Policy states that the government will aim at increasing the total volume of ODA so that it reaches 0.2 percent of GNI by 2020. The current level (2014) is at 0.14 percent. The ROK also supports the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, which provides a comprehensive framework to maximize the potential of all development actors and resources for financing sustainable development. Also, it has been actively engaged in various initiatives and activities to promote collective efforts.  
       In this regard, the ROK is taking part in the Addis Tax Initiatives and has continued to provide assistance to developing countries to modernize their tax administration systems and to bolster their capacity. The ROK has experience with difficulties in tax revenue expansion due to its weak tax administration during the early stages of its economic development, and with overcoming these challenges later. To help partner countries fully realize their potential to secure long-term and stable sources of revenues, the ROK incorporates its own experience into aid policies to establish efficient and effective institutional foundations for tax administration in partner countries.  
       The ROK has also explored the ways in which ODA and public-private partnership can play an active role in developing capital markets and expanding institutional investment in the area of infrastructure. In particular, the recent engagement of the Korea Stock Exchange with aid policies is notable, as it helped to open a securities market in Cambodia through a joint investment with the Cambodian government. KOICA is also working on a grant aid program to further develop the Cambodian securities market. As for large-scale investment in infrastructure, the ROK has actively participated in the launch of the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank in January 2016. The ROK will continuously make efforts to create new opportunities and innovative solutions that will promote greater institutional investment in infrastructure in Asia. 
       As a country transformed from one of the poorest to one of the most successful development examples in the world, and as a donor country, the ROK pays great attention to its role of bridging the divide between donors and partner countries. For instance, the ROK has incorporated south-south and trilateral cooperation into development cooperation initiatives as their core elements for attaining the Sustainable Development Goals. 
V. Next Steps 
 
       The government is expected to continue its quadruple processes to establish a coherent government mechanism for the implementation of the SDGs. First, the government will adjust goals and tasks of existing policies and institutions to better fit the SDGs. Second, all ministries will make efforts to further mainstream the SDGs into their policies. Third, the government will accelerate its discussions on establishing a coordinating mechanism for SDG implementation. Last but not least, the government is making concerted efforts to embed aspirations of the SDGs into its international development cooperation.  
 
       With such next steps in mind, the Office of Government Policy Coordination (OGPC), the MOFA, and the MOE, together with Statistics Korea, are playing a leading role in mainstreaming the SDGs and have started mapping exercises to identify existing laws, rules, regulations and policies conducive to achieving the SDGs. Based upon the results, the government will identify the targets that are most relevant in the national context of the ROK. Statistics Korea is also conducting an SDG indicator analysis, which will lay the foundation for the modification of national sustainable development indicators so as to ensure the availability of sound, disaggregated data for measuring the progress of SDG implementation in the ROK.   
            Given the fact that 230 SDGs indicators do not necessarily reflect the specific economic, social and environmental conditions of the ROK, Statistics Korea, in collaboration with Seoul National University, began a feasibility study on the establishment of the national indicators corresponding with the global indicators for the SDGs. The study aims at analyzing the definitions and meanings of the global indicators and comparing them with the existing official statistics and National Indicator System, including the Sustainable Development Indicators. By categorizing the global indicators in line with the availability of data and methodology and standardizing them to the context of Korea, the study will provide a reference for establishing a national framework of targets and indicators.  
 
       The preliminary results of the research suggest that 31.3 percent of the SDG indicators are available within the existing statistical system (Tier1), 21.7 percent need some improvement (Tier2) and 38.7 percent require the development of appropriate methodology (Tier3). Still, about 8.3 percent of the indicators are not clearly categorized. Although the results were provisional and could be modified based on the metadata from the Interagency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators and an in-depth review of existing official statistics that will be available by October 2016, there are some notable findings. First, the number of Tier1 indicators is relatively small in Goals 4, 6, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15. Developing relevant statistics for these goals will be imperative in monitoring those Goals and targets. Also, it was shown that there have been discrepancies between national and international standards. For ensuring the comparability of data at the global level, it will be important to develop a standardized statistical system. Lastly, some targets have already been achieved and did not have relevant national statistics. In sum, the national indicators that can monitor the ROK’s SDGs implementation within its national context need to be further developed. Statistics Korea in collaboration with other ministries such as the MOE will develop national indicator system of SDGs.  
 
       The ROK is paying particularly attention to strengthening the coordination role of Statistics Korea in producing, processing and sharing national data. The strength of Statistics Korea is also expected to provide technical assistance for statistical capacity building in developing countries, which is crucial to successful implementation of SDGs.  
 
       Based on the discussions and outcomes of the HLPF, the government will make continuous efforts to establish the mechanism for the domestic implementation of the SDGs, including a solid system of indicators and evaluation of the implementation of the SDGs. 
 
       CSOs, particularly those that have actively participated in the adoption process of the 2030 Agenda are preparing to engage with both the domestic and international implementation of the SDGs. They are planning to establish governance structures for both domestic and international implementation through which CSOs working on domestic issues and those working on international development and cooperation issues interact with each other to achieve the SDGs. They are particularly looking for opportunities to create synergies between CSOs working in different sectors and at various governance levels on the one hand, and on the other to interact with the private sector, local governments and science and technology communities.  
 
       CSOs assume dual roles of service delivery agency and monitoring and advocacy agents in the implementation process of the SDGs in national and international contexts. Through national projects and multi-stakeholder partnerships like CSR initiatives, they are able to contribute to implementing the SDGs in the ROK. As a monitoring and advocacy agent, they are able to participate in the monitoring and evaluation process of national SDG implementation, developing alternative indicators, publishing independent reports and carrying out national campaigns for SDGs implementation. In international development cooperation, they will play an active role as service providers and participate in multistakeholder partnerships. They will also play the role of advocacy and monitoring agent for the implementation of the SDGs in international context.   
VI. Conclusion 
 
       The early and proactive engagement of the ROK government and civil society with sustainable development has created a favorable environment for building systems for the implementation of the SDGs. A series of laws and regulations and a variety of governmental and non-governmental organizations for attaining sustainable development have developed in a mutually reinforcing way, which have already begun addressing many of the SDGs.  
 
       However, the policy efforts of various governmental ministries and agencies to address the Sustainable Development Goals pose both opportunities and challenges. The active participation of multi-stakeholders in the formulation of the SDGs in its early phase has produced a set of good conditions for an inclusive and integrated approach to the SDGs. The central government needs to encourage and facilitate more meaningful participation of local governments and civil society organizations in the national implementation of the SDGs to ensure that no one is left behind.  
  
       Reshaping international development cooperation strategy in line with the SDGs is also important. Through both bilateral and multilateral partnerships, the ROK’s new strategy contributes to leaving no one behind by forging global partnerships for the SDGs. Its key initiatives focus on the most marginalized and vulnerable groups, long-term approaches for capacity building in partner countries and creation of national and local ownership for the SDG implementation process. Sharing the knowledge and experience of the ROK, the Initiatives, including Better Life for Girls, Safe Life for All, STI for Better Life and Saemaul Undong for Rural Development, the ROK will offer an innovative pathway to enhance the effectiveness of ODA in the SDGs period and beyond.  
       In order to successfully undertake domestic and international implementation of the SDGs, there are several challenges that need to be addressed. First, there is urgent need for coordinating the various plans and policies that are related to the SDGs to create synergies between them. Second, efforts should be made to reach out and include various stakeholders, such as CSOs representing the most vulnerable and marginalized and business sectors committed to sustainable development. Third, innovative approaches to means of implementation, both financial and non-financial, should be explored and institutionalized.     
       Despite these challenges, the initial process of the ROK’s implementation of the SDGs is promising. The successful development of enabling environments for attaining the SDGs will ultimately be dependent upon the willingness and capacities of all stakeholders to make inclusive and integrated approaches to the SDGs in a coherent and participatory manner.
