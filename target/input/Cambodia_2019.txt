Section 1: Introduction
 	 
1.1  	Country Context 
In the last two decades, Cambodia has demonstrated strong economic performance, making great strides towards sustained, rapid and broad-based economic development. Cambodia has maintained an average GDP growth rate of over 7% per year, supported by policies that ensure strong macroeconomic stability and an open economy. This has resulted in higher average incomes and a dramatic reduction in poverty, accompanied by high levels of employment and benign levels of inequality (see Figure 1, which shows consumption growing faster among the bottom 40% of the population associated with declining overall inequality). 
Figure 1. Trends in consumption inequality 2007-2014 

While still classified as a least developed country (LDC), Cambodia’s strong economic growth was reflected in its graduation to a lower-middle income country status in 2016. The RGC’s Vision 2050 promote economic inclusion and environmental sustainability to ensure Cambodia becomes an upper-middle income country by 2030 and a high-income country by 2050.  
Cambodia’s rapid development has been a catalyst for transformation of the economy. Policies that prioritize industrialisation and the modernization of the economy have resulted in a declining share of the agricultural sector in GDP. The significant migration of workers to industry in urban centers, and abroad, has further shifted the balance away from the rural economy. Yet the agricultural sector remains an important source of production and employment. Cambodia is one of the world’s 10 largest rice exporters, doubling its exports of milled rice in the period 2013-2017. 
Cambodia is an open economy with an increasingly attractive investment climate. In 2017 Cambodia exported goods to 147 countries worth 60% of GDP. The leading manufacturing sector - garments and footwear - continues to grow and support positive structural change and growth in value-added. There has also been some diversification of the industrial base, notably to automotive parts and electronics. The service sector has also seen strong annual growth, especially via better performance in domestic trade and transportation. Tourism, retail/wholesale, and real estate sector, which represents major components of employment and output in the economy, continues robust growth in recent years. 
Cambodian society is currently undergoing major transformations driven by a rapid demographic transition and progressive urbanization and industrialization. Progress on social indicators, notably in health and education has also been strong. Public health has improved, including: a notable reduction in maternal, child and infant mortality rates; a reduction in the HIV/AIDS prevalence rate; and significantly reduced malaria incidence. Education reforms have enhanced life opportunities for the youth and created an improved supply of quality human resources and skills to the job market. 
The chart below depicts the path of Cambodia’s Human Development Index1, which underlines the dramatic rate of change that has made Cambodia one of the top ten performers globally.

Other important areas of progress that provide a platform for localizing and implementing the CSDGs include: 
• Political stability and peace have been maintained based on observance of the rule of law and democracy. Security and social order created a favorable environment for national development.   
• Commitment to balanced and equitable growth with a focus on welfare, for example through lowering utility prices and expansion of the National Social Security Fund and Health Equity Fund. 
• Governance reforms - Public Administration Reform, Public Financial Reform, SubNational Democratic Development Reform, the fight against corruption, legal and judicial reform, and armed forces reform – have improved the quality and effectiveness of public services.  
• Notable progress in PFM reform has strengthened revenue management. This has resulted in a threefold in education and agriculture in the period 2013-17, the health budget has more than doubled, and locally financed direct investments increased by nearly 2.5 times. 
 
This strong performance is further underpinned by progress on the Cambodian Millennium Development Goals (CMDGs), as illustrated in the chart below. Cambodia achieved the vast majority of the targets, which provides a sound basis for future SDG performance. Table 1: Summary performance against the Cambodian MDGs

While Cambodia’s socio-economic performance has been remarkable, one of the greatest challenges to further development concerns environmental degradation and Cambodia’s vulnerability to climate change. Cambodia is ranked among the world’s top ten countries most vulnerable to climate change. To attain environmental sustainability, the RGC has initiated wide-ranging environmental governance reform.  
Effective enforcement of environmental laws and policies now depends on the development of adequate technical and financial skills in relevant government institutions.  Other challenges prioritised by the RGC in its development strategy include: 
• The continued need to strengthen social services and human resources to improve life opportunities, provide safety nets, promote gender equality and boost economic competitiveness. 
• The provision of improved public services and the strengthening of the rule of law. This requires attention to institutional and regulatory frameworks, developing organisational and individual capacities, and resourcing services, especially at sub-national level. 
• Continued private sector reforms that facilitate economic transformation by addressing financial sector vulnerabilities, SME development, trade facilitation, labour market functioning and investment promotion.  
• Increased diversification of products and markets to increase value added in industry and service sectors while addressing economic vulnerability. 
• Global economic uncertainty that affects trade and Cambodia’s continued regional and global integration.  
• As Cambodia looks toward graduation from LDC status, this may lead to the reduction of ODA, favourable market access and trade arrangements. 
 1.2  	RGC’s Commitment to the Sustainable Development Agenda 
The RGC embraced the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its associated 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with a strong commitment to their achievement. The Ministry of Planning (MOP) was authorized to lead and coordinate the nationalization of the SDGs. The Cambodian SDGs (CSDGs) Framework 2016-2030 selected all 17 SDGs and added one additional goal, related to clearance of land mines and Explosive Remnants of War, reflecting the national priority of de-mining Cambodia’s territory. This resulted in a final version comprising: 18 CSDG ss, 88 nationally relevant targets, and 148 (global and locally defined) indicators including 96 national indicators.  
The formal development process of the CSDG Framework included multiple rounds of consultation with relevant stakeholders, including policymakers, line ministries and agencies, development partners and civil society organizations. It includes proposals on how the goals would be integrated within Cambodia’s policy and delivery systems.   
1.3  	Integration and nationalization Process 
The localization process of the SDGs in Cambodia began with the assessment of achievements and unfinished goals of the CMDGs in relation to the goals, targets and indicators of the SDGs. Priority was given to the coordination of the planning and implementation of the SDGs with local development strategies  
The RGC partnered with United Nations agencies in developing two preliminary analyses– the Rapid Integrated Assessment (RIA) (2016) and the SDG Assessment (2017). The RIA mapped Cambodia’s National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP) and other principal strategies to identify areas of alignment between the SDGs and Cambodia’s policy agenda, while the SDG assessment focused on the indicators and availability of reliable data sources. The Royal Government then fully adapted the SDGs to fit with the Cambodian context to include national needs, challenges, and aspirations.  
The CSDGs have been fully integrated to the NSDP 2019-2023, where they provide a large proportion of the M&E data; and via proposed inclusion in line ministry and agency’s Budget Strategic Plans (which are a major part of Cambodia’s performance-based budgeting arrangements).  The latter is especially innovative and marks Cambodia out globally. 
1.4  	Rationale 
The RGC is set to deliver its first Voluntary National Review (VNR) at the 2019 session of the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development. The preparation process was led and coordinated by the MOP. The purpose of the VNR is to report on progress towards establishing the instruments and institutions to deliver sustainable and inclusive development in Cambodia and the RGC’s plans for accelerated actions. Equally, it offers an opportunity to share experiences with peer countries, enable assessment of CSDG Framework and strengthen mechanisms to engage a wider group of stakeholders in delivering the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.  
The VNR is important for a number of reasons - as a participatory process, a means of reviewing implementation and delivery arrangements, and for offering an initial measurement of the progress made. It also provides opportunities for RGC to learn from others and to asses past experiences, and to shape opportunities for innovative and impactful solutions towards achieving the RGC’s long-term Vision 2050. 
The VNR has deepened the understandings of the multi-dimensional and cross-sectoral nature of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.  The SDGs are a comprehensive set of goals, where success in one SDG means addressing challenges and gaps in others. The review has been instrumental in enabling discussion of common challenges and prompting joint working across ministries.   
The VNR preparation process has been important for capacity building and strengthening across the Royal Government. By conducting an honest assessment of what would it take to achieve inclusive and sustainable development while leaving no one behind, the key actors are one step closer to taking action and mobilizing support. Through broad-based stakeholder engagement, this process has been involved by all stakeholders including private sector, academia, and civil society, who can contribute to achieving the national development priorities.  
Lastly, the VNR process has started to galvanize innovation and new forms of financing for development needed to achieve the CSDGs, such as how tax revenues or ODA can be used to crowd in private investments to deliver development outcomes. It has also inspired discussions on a new development finance architecture that is able to track and direct financial and investment flows to stimulate economic growth and accelerate social and environmental gains. 
1.4.1 High Level Political Forum (HLPF) and Cambodia’s VNR 2019 
The global theme of the 2019 HLPF is ‘Empowering people and ensuring inclusiveness and equality.2 While countries are encouraged to review all the goals and national priorities, the set of goals to be reviewed by this year’s HLPF are: 
• SDG 4 (Quality Education),  
• SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth),  
• SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities),  
• SDG 13 (Climate Action), 
• SDG 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions), and 
• SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals).  
Crucially, the HLPF also enables review of delivery challenges and opportunities going forward, and the sharing of lessons learned and experiences. Cambodia’s VNR delivers this review in the following sections: 
- Section 2 reviews the process and methods adopted by MOP to complete the VNR. 
 
- Section 3 provides a more detailed discussion of the country context, including Cambodia’s policy and planning framework, its current policy stance and the key issues Cambodia faces in the short and long terms. 
- Section 4 reports on the six priority goals in detail, while also providing an overview of progress on the remaining CSDGs. In doing so, this also sets out the national CSDGs Framework. 
- Finally, Section 5 reports on means of implementation issues and next steps. 
   
 
 	 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Section 2: Methodology and Approach 
 
 
2.1  	Introduction 
This second section sets out the methods and general approach adopted to compile the VNR.  It has 3 sub-sections. The first sub-section discusses the approach and sources. The second provides an overview of the key milestones and a timetable of each activity. The last subsection examines the VNR drafting process. 
2.2  	Approach and sources 
The discussion and analysis within the VNR are based on a mixed-methods research approach which consists of stocktaking of the current position, desk reviews, and interviews of key stakeholders to evaluate progress, challenges, and key policies to accelerate the CSDGs. Key documents reviewed include the Rectangular Strategy IV, the CSDGs Framework 2016-2030, and the draft NSDP 2019-20233, as well as other sectoral strategic plans. These were thoroughly examined to get a better understanding of progresses and challenges by targets and indicators of each CSDG.  
In addition, it is important to underline that the VNR process adopted an open and inclusive approach – it relied on a wide variety of quantitative and qualitative information provided from a number of stakeholder sources. Moreover, a series of consultations were undertaken within the Royal Government and with the wider Cambodian policy circles.  The key sources and information flows are depicted in the chart below. 
Figure 3: VNR Compilation and Sources

 
A template for collecting inputs for VNR from key stakeholders was developed to facilitate and standardize data format and data collection process. Secondary data from available sources was collected to analyze trends of each CSDG prior to meetings with stakeholders. This step had two advantages. First, it helped stakeholders to be aware of the availability of data and sources for CSDGs which are related to their activities, and to quickly verify the information. Secondly, the information is very useful for MOP as the CSDG facilitator and other stakeholders to identify those CSDGs which lack key data and information.  
The VNR also benefited from UN, United Nations Development Group (UNDG) and United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) guidance materials and support. The MOP team also met with their regional counterparts in Autumn 2018 to discuss the process and learn from their VNR experience.   
2.3  	Key milestones 
A full outline of the stages and the preparation timetable is provided in Table 2 below. In late 
January 2019, the MOP in partnership with the UNESCAP and the United Nations Country Team in Cambodia organized a VNR inception workshop. This event initiated the preparation process for the review.  
Its objectives were: (1) Presentation of the RGC’s key plans and policies and their alignment with the CSDGs; (2) Explanation of the general guidelines and timeline for the preparation of the VNR 2019; (3) Exploration of various challenges and opportunities - data, policy coherence and means of SDG implementation; and (4) Informing and drawing diverse stakeholders into the process. The latter included civil society, development partners, and the UN agencies, and this wide engagement has been maintained.  
The outcome of the workshop was a shared understanding of main steps and methods required for the preparation of Cambodia’s VNR 2019, including identification of key themes. The workshop also facilitated further agreement between the RGC and its partners on the next steps; namely the resources for data and analysis, and the partnerships and institutional processes needed for the successful preparation of the VNR. This also required that attention was given to meaningful stakeholder engagement on the VNR process and beyond. Efforts were made during plenaries, and via electronic media tools, to promote ongoing stakeholder engagement. 
An additional consultative meeting with Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), organized by the Cooperation Committee for Cambodia (CCC) 4 also took place to collection inputs for contribution to VNR 2019. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation (MFA-IC) also organized similar consultative forum with International NGOs. 
Consultative workshops were conducted both at the technical and high levels to verify data, validate inputs, and collect further information and feedback to refine successive drafts of the 
VNR, as well as to get approval for key messages of the report5. Attendees comprised of representatives of the Royal Government, development partners, academia, private sector, and civil society organizations.

Drafting VNR 2019 started after receiving inputs from line ministries/agencies. As noted, the CSDGs Framework provided a key source of data, and of proposals for the delivery of the goals, their governance, oversight and resourcing the means of implementation issues.   
 
Feedback on the draft was received via a series of consultative meetings (also see Table 2 above) and regular circulation of drafts to focal points in key ministries. The UN agencies also offered inputs on their respective mandates, often working in close collaboration with their government counterparts, were also important in finalizing the draft.  
Contacts based outside of Cambodia, notably UNESCAP and UNDG at the regional level also offered their inputs. Past experience of VNRs preparation from the neighboring countries also provided valuable guidance on the content and format of the text.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Section 3: Policy and Enabling Environment 
 
 
3.1 Creating ownership of the Sustainable Development Goals  
The SDGs underpin the wider Sustainable Development Agenda, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly’s 2015 session, and herald new priorities and thinking on global development needs and directions. Foremost, the 2030 Agenda recognizes the twin global priorities of delivering environmental sustainability (and specifically mitigating the threat posed by climate change) and the ongoing priority of eradicating poverty, and emphasize the centrality of securing equity, under the strapline leaving no one behind.  
The RGC efforts to create and demonstrate ownership of the Sustainable Development Agenda began with the participation of the Prime Minister at the September 2015 General Assembly meeting. The Ministry of Planning was nominated to lead the CSDG effort in late-2015 and it has been active since that time to incorporate the Goals into national plans as well as to reach out to other RGC ministries and agencies and to represent the RGC in dialogue with sub-national authorities and non-government stakeholders.  
On-going RGC reforms, especially in PFM and public administration reform, have provided momentum for the Goals with their respective focus on results-based budgeting and improved public serve delivery. RGC-led coordination efforts have integrated the CSDGs into existing management and dialogue mechanisms, principally the Development Cooperation and Partnerships Strategy and its associated network of Technical Working Groups that bring together senior RGC officials, development partners and civil society representatives. Efforts to develop and embed a monitoring eco-system are on-going (section 5.3), awareness raising, especially at sub-national level, has been prioritised (section 5.4), a number of capacity-related initiatives have been formulated (section 5.5) and the CSDGs have been firmly anchored in the RGC’s existing multi-stakeholder partnership arrangements (section 5.6).  
As opposed to the MDGs which were more focused on basic social and environmental policy outcomes, the SDGs focus on all aspects of sustainability and inclusion and take full account economic, social, governance and environmental dimensions. They are also more expansive, running to 17 goals and 169 targets (compared to the MDG’s 8 goals and 48 targets), and are markedly more ambitious by seeking absolute reductions and strict equalities, rather than proportional changes. Additionally, unlike the MDGs, the SDGs include both development outcomes (eradicate poverty, end gender inequality etc.) as well as guiding goals (decent employment and economic growth, responsible consumption and production etc.). This combination and the level of ambition ensures that the SDGs offer a comprehensive and integrated development planning tracking framework.  
Cambodia started its nationalization process in late 2015 by reviewing and mapping the global goals and targets to national priorities. Although led and coordinated by MOP, several consultations on development of indicators were organized and led by MOP with the participation from line ministries and agencies and key development partners. The final CSDGs Framework 2016-2030 was approved in November 2018 and, to clearly demonstrate ownership, its policies, principles and tools are fully reflected in the RGC’s Rectangular Strategy for the period 2019-2023.  
3.2  	Incorporating the Sustainable Development Goals in Cambodia’s national planning and policymaking framework  
The CSDGs framework, alongside the Political Platform of the RGC set out in the Rectangular Strategy Phase IV (RS-IV), provides the basis for the new cycle of the National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP) 2019-2023. The RGC prepared and endorsed RS-IV after the last 
National elections in July 2018. It is important to also bear in mind that in line with the global goals, the CSDGs timeframe complements the Cambodia Vision 2050, with several electoral planning cycles (see Figure 4). 
The CSDGs also place high emphasis on leaving no one behind so that all Cambodians share in the country’s future development and prosperity. This is matched with a commitment to sustainability, to developing while also protecting the nation’s abundant natural capital for current and future generations, and to playing Cambodia’s part in combating climate change. The CSDGs Framework has four specific objectives: 
• Presentation of the national goals, targets, and indicators based on Cambodia’s priorities; 
• Identification of the agencies responsible for oversight and conducting activities to achieve the targets and monitor schedules; 
• Identification of data sources for each indicator, and the data cycle, with a provision of working definitions and methods for calculating indicators; 
• Presentation of pathways towards achievement of targets, setting (2015) national baselines, setting annual (or cycle-based) target values, and the implementation at subnational level. 
Figure 4: National Planning Timelines and CSDGs 

 
The framework is not an action plan for delivery of the goals per se, but rather it seeks to lay out the groundwork for integrating the CSDGs into the national planning process and monitoring achievements via the efforts and actions of the Royal Government, the development partners, the private sector, CSOs, and other stakeholders.  
3.3  Matching the three dimensions of sustainable and inclusive development to Cambodia development strategies  
Integration of economic, social and environmental dimensions is key to achieving sustainable development. The RGC accepts the need for the integration of these three key dimensions; however, questions arise as to how this integration is to be achieved. Cambodia has progressed well on this front. These three dimensions are mainstreamed into strategic planning both at the national and sub-national levels. At the national level, the core framework of the RS IV, endorsed in July 2018, specifies four policy rectangles: (1) Human resource development; (2) Economic diversification; (3) Private sector and market development; and (4) Sustainable and inclusive development. These are set out below in Figure 5. The RS then feeds into the NSDP, which in turn drivers sector planning and delivery, and hence budgeting. The RGC is confident that the CSDGs are well integrated at national level, through their synthesis within the NSDP. 
At the sub-national level, a sub-decree on 5-year development plans and 3 year rolling plans at capital and provincial level was promulgated in 2009. At provincial level, 5-year development plans are developed and endorsed by the capital and provincial councils. The preparation of these development plans is to support the RS by identifying priority areas, indicators, timeframe for the implementation of the plans, the monitoring and evaluation mechanism, responsibilities of the implementing agencies and relevant stakeholders, under the framework of the capital and provincial administration. The planning processes addresses 4 challenges including (1) economy, (2) social development, (3) natural resources, environment, and climate change adaptation, and (4) security. The RGC accepts that the CSDGs still need to be matrixed to these sub-national processes, which will start from this year 2019. 
Figure 5: Rectangular Strategy Phase IV 

3.4  	Economic development, sustainability and inclusion 
Economic development is key to overall development in Cambodia and will continue to be the main driver for employment and prosperity. Yet, there is a policy consensus in government that economic development should become more compatible with the other two dimensions (the social and environmental) as set out within RS IV.  Equally, the RGC also accepts that social inclusion and environmental goals cannot be achieved and maintained unless they are in harmony with economic development.  
In addition, the many CSDGs that are not directly related to economic activities, for example public and social goals, need also to be financed, and these financial resources must be generated from productive economic activities. Thus, a strong, stable and growing economy is central to CSDG achievement. The Government will adopt an economic policy mix rooted in growth maximization and promoting structural change, while also promoting sustainability and inclusion.  
Moreover, Cambodia aims in the medium term to become largely self-sufficient, and less dependent on donor funding and assistance - with a national economy capable of creating jobs, prosperity and social well-being, and delivering environmentally compatible development. This goal relies on development of an efficient industrial sector and new higher value-added activities. 
All of these considerations highlight the need for sustainable and inclusive economic development. So, in the coming years, the RGC will make further efforts to achieve the economic development which is environmentally friendly and socially inclusive.  
3.5  	Leaving no one behind  
Inclusion is at the heart of Cambodia Vision 2050. It has identified three key policy developments within the RS-IV, in Rectangle 1, centered on Human Resource Development.  
First is the development of a broad “National Social Protection Policy Framework 2016-2025” (NSPPF), a strategic plan to ensure income security and reduce economic and financial vulnerability of its citizens. The RGC aims to increase people’s well-being, build resilience to risk, boost social solidarity and to reduce poverty to a maximum extent. The policy framework aligns, with and improves upon existing social protection programmes and enhances the efficiency, equity, transparency and consistency of the social protection system as a whole. The system will be progressive expanded dependent on the level of economic growth, with the aims of expanding the currently relatively low coverage in order to respond to the needs of the citizens in all segments.  
The NSPPF will play a crucial role in increasing the accessibility of social security and social assistance services for citizens in the public, and the formal and informal private sector. To realize the new vision for Cambodia’s social protection system, the RGC will set up necessary programmes and mechanisms step by step. At the same time, it is important to reform the system, to focus on protecting poor and vulnerable groups and build the infrastructure necessary for ensuring efficiency and sustainability. Additionally, in the future, a framework on governance and cross-cutting issues will also be developed to ensure the efficiency of the system and its budgetary implications.  
Second is the issue of healthcare and specifically, access to affordable quality provision. The Cambodian Health Equity Fund (HEF) developed by the Ministry of Health, provides access to free healthcare to around 16.3% of the population who are categorized (under the Identification of Poor household (IDPoor) scheme administered by MOP) as poor.  
Third, given inevitable changes in demographics, and specifically recognizing the rising proportion of the elderly population and that this will not only affect the old but all parts of society and all sectors of the economy, the RGC revised the 2003 Policy for the Elderly, renaming it the “National Ageing Policy 2017-2030”. This aims to mainstream ageing into the development planning process, on the basis of three fundamental concepts:  
1. Elimination of age-based discrimination so that older persons are guaranteed the same rights as younger persons and treated at par with them in all respects;  
2. Ensuring gender equality by focusing more on women who form the majority of the older population and are more vulnerable than their male contemporaries;  
3. Promotion of sound intergenerational relations so as to maintain the strength of the joint family system, a hallmark of Khmer culture.  
The overall vision of the policy is to ensure that older persons are empowered to fully participate with freedom and dignity for as long as they wish to in family, community, economic, social, religious and political activities. Moreover, that all persons are better equipped with knowledge that enables them to lead a more productive, healthy, active and dignified life in old age.  
3.6  	Securing environmental sustainability   
In aiming to achieve its Vision 2050, the Royal Government is keen to place stronger emphasis on the environmental impacts of rapid social and economic development. Greater attention will be given to better management of natural resources and responding to the impacts of climate change. This is explicitly recognized in Rectangle 4 of RS-IV. There are two specific policy initiatives. Firstly, there is a need to improve the management of Cambodia’s abundant forests and watercourses. For this reason, the Environment and Natural Resources Code is being drafted to enable the sustainable development of Cambodia, by protecting the environment and conserving, managing, and restoring natural and cultural resources. Secondly, efforts are needed to mitigate the effects of rising temperatures. The Cambodia Climate Change Strategic Plan 2014–2023 (CCCSP) has been formulated reflecting political will, and the firm commitment and readiness of the RGC to reduce climate change impacts on national development, and contribute, with the international community, to global efforts for mitigating GHG emissions under the UNFCCC. Integration of climate change into national and sub-national level planning, and the development of climate change strategies, action plans and financing frameworks are priority actions for RGC. The CCCSP will guide national entities and assist non-governmental organizations and development partners in developing concrete and appropriate measures and actions related to adaptation and GHG mitigation, which are key supportive pillars for the achievement of the Rectangular Strategy and the CSDGs. 
 	 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Section 4: Progress on goals and targets 
 
 
 
4.1  	Introduction  
A key purpose of the VNR is to track Cambodia’s national performance on the CSDGs, drawing on quantitative data and qualitative reports. This section first offers a snapshot of progress at the end of 2018 in two parts: first, on the six prioritized goals which are associated with the HLPF’s theme Empowering people and ensuring inclusion and equality (in Section 4.2); and subsequently in summary form for the remaining 12 CSDGs (in Section 4.3).  
A three-way summary assessment of progress is presented at target level for both sets of goals, and defined as: 
• On track: where target indicators are close to the specified milestone data; 
• Ahead of track: where target indicators are generally 10% ahead of the milestone data; • Below track: where target indicators are generally 10% below of the milestone data. 
Targets where the available data are not sufficient to enable a judgment to be made on progress, were not classified.  
4.2  	In-depth Review of 6 SDGs: Empowering people and ensuring inclusion and equality 
This section reviews in some detail, the six global prioritized goals, specifically CSDGs 4, 8, 10, 13, 16 and17. In addition to more in-depth discussion on progress to date, challenges and policy actions, each includes the full CSDG baseline and progress data (noting that we do not include indicators, where the data is not available). 
At summary level, and although it remains early days, progress has been strong on the six priority goals, with large majority (61.3%) on or above track. Progress has been evaluated based on the relevant CSDG targets as follows and is as illustrated in Figure 6: 
• 29.0% of the targets were ahead of track; 
• 32.3% were on track; 
• 0% were below track; 
• 38.7% lacked sufficient data to make a judgment

CSDG 4: Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all 
 
Progress 
Available data suggest Cambodia’s significant progress on many fronts in the education sector (Table 3). The completion rate at primary, and secondary levels and the proportion of grade 1 students who passed through all ECE programmes has increased from 80.6%, 39.2%, and 64.1% in 2015 to 86.1 %, 47.6% and 72%, respectively, in 2018. Similarly, Cambodia achieved gender parity in education sector, and is beginning to tilt in the favor of girls in recent years.  
The gender parity index of gross enrollment rate at both lower secondary education and upper secondary education increased from 1.1 in 2015 to 1.2 in 2018. Adult literacy rate also increased from 80.5% to 82.5% over 2015-2018. Comparing to targets set in CSDG framework, except the completion rate at primary school, the figures suggest that all other targets, where data is available, are being attained or in some cases exceeded. This has been as a result of concerted efforts by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports (MOEYS) and concerned stakeholders, through the implementation of Education Strategic Plan 2014-2018. The new National Education 2030 Roadmap for CSDG4 will build on these achievements. 
Challenges 
While continuing with the impressive progress, a number of challenges to be addressed including: (1) equitable and inclusive access for the children to all levels of education and training (2) transition from primary to lower-secondary and high drop-out rates at the lowersecondary levels (3) quality issue from pre-primary to tertiary educators, (4) life-long learning, which is a key to life-long employment and allow adoption of skills and knowledge to the structural change of the economy, is still a new concept for many people. 
Key Policies/Accelerating Strategies  
The MOEYS has developed and adopted the National Education 2030 Roadmap for CSDG4, which provides the overarching framework for a long-term holistic sector-wide approach for the development and delivery of education services and set priorities and strategies on how Cambodia will achieve these targets.  
CSDG4 is well aligned with Government’s priorities in the RS IV. Improved general education, vocational and competence skills, entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation and a healthy life style are core components in Rectangle 1 of the RS IV. Side 1 of the Rectangle 1 is the strengthening of the quality of education, science and technology with the objective of “quality, equitable and inclusive education system”. Side 2 touches on the Technical Training with an aim to ensure that “each individual youth specializes in at least one skill in life”. Side 4 is on gender equity and social protection to enhance social-economic situation and strengthen the role of women.

The RGC has initiated a number of key policy and strategic interventions for the period 20192023, which includes: 
i. Articulation of a clear vision and mission for the Education System for a knowledgeable-society by 2030 with the MOEYS leading the direction of education development to ensure that all schools transform themselves into learning organizations ensuring high quality education for all through competent, motivated and well-supported teachers in the smart classrooms providing the best opportunities to learn to all students and committed students acquiring both hard and soft skills, sound moral judgement, emotional intelligence as well as a strong sense of national 
and global citizenship that enables them to contribute to and actively participate in the society; 
ii. Systematically increasing the coverage of early-childhood care and education to reach 82%, Primary completion to 91.1%, Lower-Secondary completion to 61.1%, Upper-
     Secondary completion to 45%, TVET GER to 35% and Tertiary GER to 25% by 2030; iii. In Teacher Policy, systematically implementing the teacher reforms addressing the issues of recruitment, training, deployment, continuous professional development, mentoring/on-site support and career pathways; 
iv. Providing institutionalized in-service training for teachers at all levels in line with the MOEYS CPD policy of 100 hours per year, and training on Inquiry-Based Learning 
Methodology in the context of the 21st Century Skills; 
v. Scaling-up Early Grade Learning (EGL) to enhance reading, writing and mathematics to provide solid foundations for learners to succeed in higher grades; 
vi. Strengthening implementation and monitoring of inclusive education policies, including provision of targeted scholarships for learners from all disadvantaged groups to ensure equity and “no–one” is left behind; 
vii. Bringing the educational reforms in the class-rooms by enhancing the capacities of the school principals, school management committees and stakeholders through training and implementation of school-based management; 
viii. Reforming and revising the curriculum to integrate the 21st century skills including the inquiry-based learning, communication skills and problem solving; 
ix. Conducting systematic assessment of student learning at Grades 3, 6, 8 and 11 to monitor learning of students as per the curriculum objectives;  
x. Introducing and expanding flexible learning opportunities and academic equivalency programmes particularly at the secondary level to enable young-people to continue learning and skilling themselves using ICTs; 
xi. Consistently improving and increasing the budget allocation to the schools to meet the needs of teaching and learning in the class-rooms and strengthening capacities for financial management and accountability; 
xii. Strengthening internal and external quality assurances in higher education and encourage learners to enroll in STEM education in tertiary and higher education; and 
xiii. Implementing the National Strategy for Development of Education Statistics to strengthen the over-all coordination and monitoring of SDG-4 implementation. 
Case Study 1: Volunteerism promoting inclusive education and youth engagement in Cambodia 
Volunteers can be brokers of engagement, connecting institutional initiative with volunteer action at community level and strengthen local governance. They can facilitate and support people’s engagement in planning, implementing and monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), thereby fostering local ownership and leveraging innovating development solutions from the ground up. Volunteerism, therefore, has much to contribute by way of harnessing the power and participation of individuals and communities to empower those who are furthest behind and address some of the social exclusion that exists as a result of poverty, gender, disability, ethnicity and other causes of inequality. 
Young people aged 10-24 account for about two-thirds of the country’s population5. Each year, roughly 300,000 young people enter the labor market7. However, technical and competency skills of young people need to be substantively strengthened to meet the increasing demands for skillful employees. Echoing the policy focus of the Royal Government of Cambodia on curriculum reform to integrate the 21st century skills, MOEYS, Cambodia, and the United Nations Volunteers (UNV) has launched three youth volunteering pilot programmes, including: 
 
1. Volunteering for community services 
2. Volunteering for social entrepreneurship 
3. Volunteering on school holidays  
The three pilot programmes aim to improve skills including teamwork, problem solving and inquiry-based learning among young people. Moreover, they also endeavor to capacitate young people as solutions for sustainable development through volunteering opportunities.  
From October 2018, the three pilot programmes have mobilized 1,350 young volunteers in seven provinces of Cambodia, who provided community development services to over 9,000 people. The services provided by young volunteers encompass diverse topics related to Sustainable Development Goals, ranging from organic agriculture and child heath to water, sanitation and waste management. It is worth noting that services provided by young volunteers effectively complement those provided by the government, especially in the poor and remote communities.  
What underlines the services of young volunteers is the inclusive nature of volunteerism itself. Among the volunteers participating in the three piloting programmes, almost half are women, and a lot of them originate from the poor rural families. In addition to chances of skills strengthening, volunteerism provides equal opportunities for all young people to learn and grow their knowledge on community services. In this way, volunteerism has become the vehicle expanding inclusive education opportunities, enabling all young people to learn and exchange knowledge in a participatory approach.  
Witnessing the power of volunteerism in engaging youth as a part of development solutions, it is encouraging to learn that the Prime Minister has officially identified establishing volunteering network at the grassroot level as one of the five strategic recommendations at the 2019 National Education Congress.  
CSDG 8: Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all  
 
Progress 
Cambodia has achieved high economic growth of around 7.0% per annum for the last two decades and attained lower middle-income status in 2015 in terms of GDP per capita, which reached USD 1,548 in 2018. The percentage of Cambodians living under the national poverty line fell around 1% per year on average down to about 10% in 2018 from 35% in 2005.  
The direct contribution of travel and tourism to GDP was 12.7% in 2018, compared with 12.8% set in the target. This directly provided 620,000 jobs or 6.4% of total employment, below the target of 7%. The growth rate of online business registration and growth rate of issuing certificate of origin through the automation system in 2018 were much higher than targeted while the growth rate of online trademark registration was a little bit below the target (Table 4).  
With substantial ongoing investment by both public and private sector, Cambodia’s economy is forecasted to continue growing robustly, with further structural change in favour of industrial development, from 27.7% GDP in 2015 to 32.8% in 2018 and 38.2% in 2022. Financial services and the banking sector have been growing sharply in the past decade and more soundly in the past 4 years, as high credit growth was brought under control. There has been a boom in the construction and real estate sector in the past few years. However, it is unlikely to be sustainable due to the speculative nature of the businesses in those sectors.   
Challenges 
Despite such considerable progress, CSDG 8 faces some challenges.  
First, Cambodia needs to diversify and expand its manufacturing base by moving away from labour-intensive industries - mainly the garment in cut-trim and make (CTM) nature -  to those that demand a more skilled workforce, more advanced technologies, and higher value added.  
Second, although there has been a remarkable increase in the number of registered companies, but some companies or enterprises are still unregistered and some have not provided update their status. Related to Intellectual Property (IP), there is still lack skilled officials who can process and response to any matter quickly. Public awareness about IP is still limited, and there is a lack of facilities to support the process.  
Third, industrial development has been hampered by the lack of quality electricity, skills and logistics among other constraints. The Industrial Development Policy (IDP) 2015-2025 provides many good interventions and about 100 measures, however its implementation in the past few years has been seen limited progress.  
Fourth, as far as One Village One Product (OVOP) is concerned, challenges include: (1) Limited support from the subnational authority in promoting the OVOP movement; (2) Limited cooperation and coordination; (3) insufficient human resources; (4) limited budget for the promotion of OVOP movement; (5) limited cooperation between SMEs and the general secretariat of the OVOP in the promotion of Khmer products; and (6) significant gap in competitiveness between Khmer and Foreign products in the capital/ provinces/cities/ districts’ product exhibitions. 
Fifth, the development of greater potential for tourism is constrained by the lack of infrastructure to support the sector growth and diversification, and low quality of services and products that support the sector.

Key Policies/Accelerating Strategies 
While focusing on economic growth, the RGC also needs to ensure that the growth is inclusive through productive employment, decent work for all, and environmental safeguarding. Therefore, a number of policies have been introduced. To achieve a Decent Work Agenda, in 2015 the National Employment Policy (NEP) 2015-2025 was developed with the key elements of the policy strongly connected with the decent work agenda. At the same time Industrial Development Policy (2015-2025) was also prepared and adopted as a guide to promote the country's industrial development that will help maintain sustainable and inclusive high economic growth through economic diversification, strengthening competitiveness and promoting productivity.  
Furthermore, the “China Ready” policy which was released in May 2016, aims to maximize the potential of the rapid rise in China’s outbound tourism by encouraging businesses in Cambodia’s tourism industry to hire Mandarin-speaking staff, translate menus and promotional posters, facilitate payment in yuan and offer ecotourism options. 
The RGC made a move to set up Skills Development Fund (SDF) managed by the MEF to stimulate pragmatic public-private partnership projects in bridging the skills gaps in the economy. It is expected to attract higher value-added investments and generating decent jobs.  
In 2018, RGC issued a Sub-Decree to provide tax break to SMEs for up to 5 years. In addition, SME Bank and Entrepreneurship Development Fund and Entrepreneurship Promotion Centre have been created by the Ministry of Economy of Finance and are expected to be up and running in 2019.  
In early 2019, Government formed a working group to formulate “digital economy policy framework” with an aim to instigate and facilitate the growth of technologies in the Cambodian economy. Moreover, RGC has started to mainstream technologies in addition to gender and climate change adaptation in development projects financed by development partners.   
Most recently, 17 reform measures, including the above-mentioned actions, were introduced to the Government Private Sector Forum with an aim to improve Cambodia’s competitiveness by reducing logistic costs and attracting foreign direct investment. 
  
CSDG 10: Reduce inequality within and among countries 
 
Progress 
Based on CSES consumption data, inequality in Cambodia began to increase between 2004 and 2007 but has declined since then. The share of total consumption of the poorest 20% of households increased slightly from 7.5% in 2007 to 8.5% in 2009 and 9.3% in 2012, whereas the share of total consumption of the richest 20% of households decreased from 46% in 2007 to 41% in 2009. By 2017, the Gini coefficient of inequality was 0.29, which is the lowest one in the region.    
Progress has been made in issuing land titles to Cambodian citizens. By end of 2018, the government provided 5,127,819 land titles equivalent to 73.25% of the 7 million quotation marks. Registration of land of indigenous communities reached 24 communities equivalent to 2,558 families.

The RGC has adopted the National Policy on Housing and Policy on Incentives and Establishment of the National Programme for Affordable Housing Development; has built a number of affordable houses in Phnom Penh and Kandal province; has developed information technology (IT) system for the management of property construction data by connecting to Geographical Information System (GIS) of Google Maps; has granted land titles, social land concessions and built houses for families of soldiers and police officers, families of deceased soldiers, veterans with disability who are living in poverty without land/houses currently based along the borders. All social land concession programmemes have provided land to a total population of 78,545 households equaling 140,765.47 hectares and constructed houses for a total population of 6,699 and decided to provide over 1.2 million hectares equal to 71 Land titles for approximately 400,000 families through the implementation of “Old political issues New activities in the land sector”. 
RGC has made tremendous effort needed to be made with regards to international trade which is one of the key drivers to reduce inequality among countries. Growth rate of trade agreement: Through the accumulation number, the number of trade agreement consist of 76 in 2016 and will consist of 209 in 2022 with the average growth rate 21%. 
The RGC has also introduced a number of policies to reduce inequality in Cambodia. First, the RGC has formulated Cambodian Health Equity Fund (HEF) in order to provide access to free health care to those people who are categorized as poor. The prerequisite for this care is a socalled IDPoor status with an individual older family based “membership card”, which is issued as part of a comprehensive identification process. Second, the “National Ageing Policy 20172030” was produced by taking into account the projected demographic changes and the need to mainstream ageing into the development planning process. Third, a broad “National Social Protection Policy Framework 2016-2025” was developed to create a strategic plan to ensure income security and reduce economic and financial vulnerability of its citizens. It will increase people’s well-being and solidarity in the society and aims at reducing poverty to a maximum extent. 
Challenges 
Although a lot of efforts made by the RGC, there is still a gap between the households in urban areas and those in rural areas. Inequality, especially the development gap between urban and rural areas, in the country has led to a flow of internal and cross-border labor migration. The number of internal migrant workers is about one million and the number of cross-border migrant workers hit more than one million. While this is an equalizing process, RGC also recognizes the importance of better managing population flows, and the urbanization process. 
There is a limited coverage of social services. The link between the ID card and IDPoor has not been connected into a system for a good management of information about the poor and vulnerable. There is a lack of capacity to assess disabilities; and as a result, some disabled/invalid persons are left behind.  Social protection reforms hold much promise for keeping inequality in check, and promoting redistribution alongside a safety net to support economic activity. 
The labour market also has been key to the inclusiveness of the economy in Cambodia, with strikingly high levels of participants regardless of gender.  The Royal Government has facilitated this by allowing a free labour market alongside a basic regulatory framework, including minimum wage provisions in regularized employment.   
Despite government efforts to accelerate international trade, strengthening and increasing the trade integration into the world through trade agreement meet some challenges including, (1) few amount of types and quantity of product into international market, (2) quality control and standard requirement are not broad yet, (3) export price is still high (high production cost), and 
(4) non-tariff barrier on Cambodia’s product. 
Key Policies/Accelerating Strategies 
To reduce inequality, the government will continue to focus on pro-poor rural development. According to a study by the Asian Development Bank, the main rural development issues are insecurity in land tenure, low productivity in land and human capital, market failures and coordination issues, and limited financing for rural development. 
Inclusive education and healthcare are the most important sectors in rural development. Increasing public investment in these two sectors is needed. Social protection, including social safety nets and social insurance policies, need to be strengthened. 
The government will also strengthen and increase relationship and trade agreements to speed up the trade integration into the region and the world, identify the topic of trade agreement as priority, and improve trade relationship internationally in term of equality and equity. 
 
CSDG 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts 
 
Progress 
Cambodia is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change in the region and is among the top 10 countries globally. The National Council for Sustainable Development is coordinating the implementation of CSDG 13 (climate action). A dedicated Climate Change Technical Working Group (CCTWG) has been established including all concerned ministries and agencies, as well as provincial authorities. Climate change has been integrated in the Rectangular Strategy IV 2018-2023, and in the National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP) 2019-2023. Key achievements to date include increasing annual public expenditure for climate change, improved integration of climate change in national and sectoral plans, and initial progress on reduction of Green House Gases (GHGs) emission.  
Cambodia has also ratified the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and submitted its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the UNFCCC, with the following key features: 
• A set of 13 priority actions for climate change adaptation; 
• An initial cost estimate of USD1.27 billion for the climate change response in 20152019; 
• A reduction of 27% (or 3,100 Gg CO2eq) of GHG, compare to the projected 2030 baseline of 11,600 Gg CO2eq; to be achieved mostly through promotion of energy efficiency and renewable energy in the energy, manufacturing and transport sectors. 
• Working towards forest cover of 60% of the total land area; 
In line with NDC, the government implemented a number of actions to make Cambodia resilient to climate change, including: 
• Management and development of water resources, including the development of irrigation system; 
• Management of flood, salted water and drought;  
• Protection and conservation of water resource; and  
• Management of information on water resource and meteorology. 
• Enhancement of CDM and JCM project implementation 
• Enhancement of sub-national climate change planning and execution of priority actions • Promotion of public awareness and capacity building for climate response. 
There are 14 ministries and agencies, i.e. MPWT, MRD, MOWRAM, MIH, MME, MLMUPC, MOT, NCDM, Ministry of Information, NCSD/MOE, MAFF, MOWA, MOH, and MOEYS which developed and implemented Climate Change Action Plan (CCAP) 2014-2018 in their sectors. 
Challenges 
The CSDG 13 implementation faces the following challenges:  
• Technological and human resources capacities to implement adaptation and mitigation solutions remain limited. Technology transfers should be promoted further; 
• Despite recent improvements, for example with the climate change vulnerability index for communes and the 2019 GHG inventory, data availability remains a challenge, and capacities of sectors to analyze vulnerabilities and track climate change adaptation and mitigation need to be strengthened; 
• Better evidence and research on how climate change impacts various vulnerable groups is required to improve the design and targeting of climate change programmes; 
• Financial support from developed countries (UNFCCC Annex 1 countries) for the climate change priorities identified by Cambodia is insufficient. Better alignment of international assistance with national priorities is required. 
• Access to finance for climate-smart investments is still limited for the private sector.  
• Adequate financing instruments should be developed, linked with awareness campaigns and dissemination of climate-smart technologies.

Key Policies/Accelerating Strategies 
The RGC will continue: 
• to mainstream the environment and natural resources sustainability into the national development planning through the National Council for Sustainable Development (NCSD), which is an inter-ministerial institution with the Prime Minister as its Honorary Chair, Minister of Environment as its Chair, 
• to implement the development and implementation of NESAP 2016-2023 complements the existing national strategies, action plans and programmes,  
• to implement the Cambodia Climate Change Strategic Plan (CCCSP) 2014-2023, which is in line with the commitments made at the Rio+20 Conference on Sustainable Development, contributing to the achievement of CSDGs, in particular SDG 12 and SDG 13. CCCSP is allowing the integration of climate change into national and subnational level planning and particularly into the NSDP and sector development plans of all relevant ministries. 
The final draft of the Environment and Natural Resources Code has been finalized and will be approved soon as the national policy for the environment reform.  
Technical guidelines are gradually being introduced in concerned ministries e.g. to climateproof water and road infrastructures, or to improve the capacities of health professionals to prevent and treat climate-sensitive diseases. 
MOWRAM will continue to ensure the sustainability of water resource for agriculture, urban and rural supply, hydropower, fishery, transportation and tourism. The ministry will develop Strategy and Action Plan for Water Resource and Meteorology 2019-2023 to implement the NSDP 2019-2023 and RS-IV. 
CSDG 16. Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels 
Progress 
The RGC has been striving to consolidate peace, political stability and social order as the fundamental foundation to strengthen good governance, the Rule of Law and respect for human rights in accordance with national laws and regulations. Good governance continues to be at the core of national development priorities and progress continues on the implementation of all major reforms including (1) the Fight against Corruption, (2) the Public Administration Reform, (3) the Legal and Judicial Reform, (4) the Reform of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces, (5) the Public Financial Management Reform, and (6) the Decentralization and De-concentration reform. The engagement of all relevant stakeholders through the creation of Technical Working Groups (TWGs) has also been ensured. 
The RGC has strived to ensure justice for all (see case study 2). The progress related to this includes key efforts made to improve legal and judicial systems. Some necessary legal frameworks were introduced in order to enhance the competence, independence and impartiality of judiciary which is crucial for strengthening the Rule of Law. Major laws, including the Penal Code, Criminal Procedure Code, the Civil Procedure Code, the Juvenile Justice Law (with a 3 year Strategic Operational Plan for its implementation) and other laws and regulations related to political, economic, social and cultural life were promulgated to contribute to the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Additionally, rotation of judges and prosecutors from one area to another is deemed as a notable strategy in fighting corruption within the judicial system. 
The RGC has placed considerable emphasis on the improvement of human rights. The rate of voter turnout was very impressive for the 2018 National Election – with the rate increasing from 69.61% in 2013 to 83.02% in 2018. 
The RGC regards legal measures relating to freedom of association, peaceful assembly and expression and political rights undertaken since 2015 as an important part of enhancing freedoms under the law and social order in the country. Moreover, the RGC through MOI announced that all CSOs which were already registered with the ministry can legally carry out activities in Cambodia. 
Globally, the Royal Government has made sustained contribution to UN Peacekeeping, and stands out as an example to the world and carries the same universal values of peace, security and friendship at its heart. In the 1990s, Cambodia benefited from the support of UN peacekeepers to bring peace. Some years later, Cambodia started to send troops to peacekeeping operations across the globe to assist in finding peace and safety for Cambodian citizen and each had made a priceless sacrifice. Having regained political stability, starting from 2006, Cambodia has dispatched troops to peacekeeping operations across the globe to fulfill their important role in restoring and promoting peace and stability to conflicting nation states, and every peacekeeper has made priceless sacrifice. Cambodia is proud to have contributed 315 women out of 6, 268 peacekeeping troops, many engineering and demining companies, since 2006 to present, to the UN Peacekeeping Operations serving missions in Sudan, South Sudan, Chad, Lebanon, Mali, Central African Republic, Syria and Cyprus. Cambodia is one of the largest contributors of blue helmets in the ASEAN region.

Consultation mechanisms have been put in place and operational to ensure inclusive participation of all relevant stakeholders. 
The RGC has officially established the Law on Access to Information, which the Ministry of Information has led in collaboration with the Swedish Embassy and UNESCO through the establishment of a Joint Technical Working Group. The draft law has been finalized at the technical working group level, and it has proceeded to ensure legality and comprehensiveness in compliance with the international standards and the socioeconomic situation of Cambodia. 
The RGC has strongly committed to promoting partnership with CSOs in all aspects of development and a series of initiatives have been taken by the RGC’s ministries to remove certain administrative requirements and have held regular consultative fora with CSOs and establishing an inter-ministerial working group to address their requests and concerns. 
The RGC also takes concrete actions to: 
(1) Strengthen education to avoid corruption through the inclusion of anti-corruption lessons in general education curriculum from grades 4 to 12; disseminate information on Anti-Corruption Laws at public institutions, and via private sector, academia and media avenues; and organize public events and competitions on anti-corruption to encourage public participation. 
(2) Prevent corruption through monitoring the implementation of public services and produce other anti-corruption materials; issue warnings letters to those suspected of corruption; and stricter monitoring of examinations at all levels, from high school to public servant recruitment exams6; and ensure effective oversight of processes for procurement, and asset and liability declarations.9 
(3) Enforce the law through the establishment and implementation of a convenient corruption complaint mechanism; enable investigation of cases where there is solid evidence and formulate cases and take perpetrators of corruption to court. This was supported by the RGC’s participation in the first cycle of The United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) implementation review (2013-2015).   
The Ministry of National Assembly-Senate Relations and Inspection (MONASRI) has been active in disseminating anti-corruption measures and the amendment of the law to the subnational levels, universities, vocational training institutes, high schools and the private sector. In addition to disseminating anti-corruption law, the MONASRI has been working to improve the public trust through a more effective public service provision and transparency.  
It is also noteworthy that the proportion of female government officials in ministries/agencies has been raised by 1%, increasing from 40% in 2016 to 41% in 2018. The RGC has also been providing civil registration with the issuance of free birth certificates and free legal assistance available for the poor. 
In addition, One-Window Service is being considered/rolled out currently and is an effective governance mechanism initiated by in order to simplify administrative processes and ensure timely delivery of public services to all citizens, including businessmen, and small entrepreneurs. 
Challenges 
Fighting corruption requires a long-term effort, and the RGC has been striving to deliver in a step by step manner, aligned with its precise strategies. It is also working hard to improve resources, capacity and mechanisms. 
One of the key challenges in fighting corruption is the lack of budget to enforce existing laws. Understandings of laws and its procedures of enforcement need to be further promoted to the public. The means of dissemination of laws and regulations from national to sub-national levels will be made more innovative in order to deliver step changes in effectiveness. 
Key Policies/Accelerating Strategies 
The RGC seeks to maintain peace, political stability, security and social order; improving living standards and people’s welfare, and via the implementation of necessary measures, the promotion and protection of fundamental rights and human dignity. 
The RGC will ensure that no one in Cambodia is left behind in enjoying their rights and freedoms without discrimination regardless of race, color, sex, language, religious belief, political tendency, birth origin, social status, wealth or other statuses. 
 
The RGC continues to reform legal and judicial systems by designing a legal framework with sustainability at its center to gain the public’s trust. This includes capacity building, ensuing the independence and impartiality of courts, strengthening Rule of Law, ensuring segregation of powers, respect of individual rights, and justice for general population. RGC continues to develop new laws based on the requirements of national governance, which ensure human rights protection, democracy and rules of law.  
The RGC aims to strengthen the implementation of existing laws to be more effective by increasing the dissemination of information, and training programmes for law enforcement officials and developing capacity on the international human rights laws.  
The RGC will increase the dissemination of the laws and regulations and enhance access to judicial information, decisions and other related laws and regulations, to ensure public awareness on laws and enforcement including court decisions and proceedings, periodic administrative reports and administrative information regarding pending cases’ status and schedule information. 
The RGC continues to take actions on to combat corruption by strengthening accountability and institutional capacity building with the support and participation from the public, the participation from private sector and strengthening law enforcement.  
Case Study 2: Lawyers and Medical Doctors for the Poor 
Volunteer Lawyers 
In order to ensure a wider access to social justice, the RGC in February 2019 ordered the establishment of volunteer group of lawyers to defend poor women, who cannot afford to pay for representation. The establishment of the new legal team would not use the national budget, but an initial funding of $500,000 
will come from the prime minister’s personal budget and will cover living and food expenses, with additional money for lawyers on missions in rural areas. The women targeted to receive legal aid from the new team included poor women who were victims of land grabbing by powerful people, and underprivileged people who had been sued by powerful individuals. 
Volunteer Doctors 
In line with and to support poverty reduction efforts, the RGC established Techo Voluntary Youth Doctor Association (TYDA) in 2012, and since then around 3,600 medical doctors and health practitioners have become volunteers. TYDA was established with three main purposes: (1) contributing with the national institutions, particularly Ministry of Health, with a view to providing public health services to people free of charge regardless of race, color, or political affiliation; (2) contributing with the Royal Government in order to reduce poverty through domiciliary health service provision activities to the poor, especially the poor who live in the rural areas; and (3) contributing to the human resources in health sector as well as give opportunities to the volunteer student doctor and youth in a bid to contribute to charity works in the society. 
TYDA provides health services to people without political discrimination. Since its establishment, 
240,000 people have benefited from its free-of-charge health services. Because of its significance, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the National Social Security Fund and TYDA, so that the latter will provide treatment services free of charge to workers and people in Phnom Penh and provinces. TYDA provided diagnosis and treatment services including general diseases, oral diseases, minor-surgery, optometric diseases, heart diseases, echocardiography (ECG), hemorrhoid, gynecological diseases, fetal echo, blood test, thyroid, liver diseases, lung diseases, gastroenteritis, skin diseases, and other diseases. 
 
CSDG 17. Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development 
 
Progress 
The RGC has achieved substantial success in strengthening partnership with development partners through continuous improvement and implementation of key policies and mechanisms, especially the preparation and implementation of the Development Cooperation and Partnership Strategy (DCPS) 2014-2018 and its successor for the period 2019-2023. The government has been able to mobilize resources for national development and considers cooperation financing crucial for social development as well as the development of the country’s economy. 
In the period of 2015-2018, the volume of ODA accounted for around USD 1.4 billion per annum. The ODA grant contribution leveled off at approximately USD 800 million. The ODA/GDP ratio has fallen from 7.5% in 2015 to 5.7% in 2018. The overall volume of support to either sector or sub-sector seems to reach slightly higher than baseline and planned figures as set out in CSDGs targets within CRDB/CDC’s coverage. 
The Development Cooperation and Partnerships Strategy (2014-2018) has been developed and effectively implemented in consistent with Cambodia’s evolved development context as an LMIC. It provided a comprehensive framework for promoting development partnerships in Cambodia articulating in the RGC’s RS IV. The strategy is also aligned global initiatives on development effectiveness focusing on effective institutions, inclusive partnerships and development results. The Government ODA Database continues to serve as important tool for recording and coordinating external cooperation resources as well as providing full transparency via on-line open access and supporting monitoring of development effectiveness indicators. 
Together, there has been good progress in establishing and managing partnership mechanisms. The bilateral consultation mechanism between RGC and DPs continues to provide opportunity to jointly review development programmes and discuss development issues and opportunity. These mechanisms, together with all other Global Partnership commitments, are regularly monitored, with the most recent survey feeding into the formulation of the Development Cooperation and Partnership Strategy for 2019-2023. The results of this survey, and the consultations that formed part of the exercise, highlighted the importance of continuing to strengthen and use country systems, especially for budgeting and other PFM functions, and for providing predictable funding aligned with government priorities and results frameworks. The new DCPS for 2019-2023 was therefore formulated with a strong evidence base with inputs from a wide range of development stakeholders. Recognizing the importance of multistakeholder partnerships in achieving the CSDGs, the new DCPS provides for new consultation mechanisms with civil society, and with all development actors at sector and at sub-national levels. A revised   Technical Working Group (TWG) Guideline and a revised set of Joint Monitoring Indicators (JMIs) for 2019-2023 provide mechanisms for consultation and monitoring to further integrate the CSDGs in the work of line ministers and priority sectors as well as to build broad-based and inclusive partnerships.

The RGC also recognizes that population data is fundamental to inform national policies and programmes. Cambodia has increased the national budget for national surveys and the conduct of the 2019 the General Population Census of Cambodia in line with international recommendations and standards. This will enable the count of all persons, and to build capacity for the effective use of such data to monitor the progress against the targets and indicators of the CSDGs aiming at improving the delivery of public services for all people. The census activities have been rolling out through the TWG-PPR Sub-group D4D to ensure the quality and release of disaggregated data in a timely manner. 
 
Aiming at enhancing and strengthening the cooperation between the RGC and international NGOs, since Law on Association and Non-Governmental Organisation (LANGO) was promulgated in August 2015, a consultative meeting with international NGOs was also conducted to jointly determine the challenges and identify appropriate solution in order to effectively strengthen the enforcement of laws and regulations. 
Challenges 
Achieving national development objectives and the CSDGs requires the mobilization of a significantly increased level of resourcing and will require more complex and comprehensive financial management structures for both private and public sources.  
When Cambodia moves towards LDC graduation, the RGC will need to develop coherent policies related to economic competitiveness, trade and development cooperation to prepare Cambodia for a smooth transition, as well as to ensure that ODA provision is maintained and more predictable. Therefore, Cambodia’s strong record of economic growth, poverty reduction and Rectangular Strategy implementation means that the country has now surpassed the Human Assets Index threshold for LDC graduation. Continued effort and further actions to approach the Economic Vulnerability Index lower bound are required. Graduating from LDC status would reduce Cambodia to access a wide range of International Special Measures under various UN supported initiatives, mainly in the areas of trade, development, and technical assistances. Likewise, development partners are likely to review their support, increase their requirements for cost-sharing or counterpart funding or transition to loan financing. Thus, new development partnerships and resources must be mobilized to ensure continued CSDG progress. 
Key Policies/Accelerating Strategies 
The RGC’s lead coordination and resource mobilization agency, CRDB/CDC will continue to ensure the strategic management of ODA.  
The CSDG Framework complements the national development framework and provides a mechanism for effective partnering. To succeed in supporting the implementation of CSDGs, the Development Cooperation and Partnerships Strategy (DCPS) 2019-2023 has been developed at a time when Cambodia’s own development priorities and context are evolving. On this basis and in line with the CSDGs, it has been formulated to be evidence-based, learning from the experience and perspectives of different development actors across a wide range of sectors and themes in order to build a consensus on future priorities. In this regard, the RGC recognizes that ODA remains particularly important for its national socio-economic development agenda, and will serves as a catalyst in leveraging other sources of development finance, both private and public, to further promote inclusive growth and sustainable economic development of Cambodia. 
The RGC is fully committed to continue working in partnership to secure successful implementation of its policy agendas including CSDGs, NSDP, sector plans, and major governance reforms. RGC’s DCPS makes an important contribution to development partnerships efforts by establishing principles, setting objectives and identifying tools to promote effective cooperation. 
Key Priorities to strengthen development cooperation and partnerships in the Sixth Legislature of the National Assembly: 
• Continue strengthening inclusive partnerships with all development actors to mobilize financial resources for CSDGs implementation in accordance with established development effectiveness principles including ownership, leadership and alignment. 
• Continue actively participating in both regional and global affairs to enable opportunity for development, especially to promote the representation of peace, security, and investment opportunity in Cambodia. 
• Continue implementing all commitments that Cambodia has committed in high level forum on development effectiveness, along with strengthening the use of existing mechanisms for discussion on development cooperation issues.  
• Continue strengthening partnerships with NGOs by committing to the Law on Association and Non-Governmental Organization in order to promote effective, transparency, and accountability of development cooperation. 
4.3  	Summary Review of Remaining CSDGs  
This section reviews the remaining 12 CSDGs in a summary form on progress to date against the baselines. More than one-third of goals, targets, and indicators are on-track. Additionally, a larger number of targets do not have sufficient data.   
As illustrated in Figure 7:  
• 29.8 % of the targets are ahead of track; 
• 12.3% are on track; 
• 12.3% are below track; • 45.6% lacked sufficient data.

CSDG 1: End Poverty in all its forms everywhere 
 
Progress 
Cambodia has made tremendous progress over the last decade. Poverty was reduced dramatically in Cambodia from 53.3% in 2004 to 13.5% in 2014, making it one of the most impressive poverty reductions observed anywhere in the world. On average, poverty reduction has been more than 1.5 percentage points per year. About 80% of Cambodians live in rural areas; it is therefore not surprising that rural poverty has evolved at the same pace as the national trend. Poverty is overwhelmingly concentrated in rural areas, and the gap appears to be growing as economic opportunity is concentrated in the urban sector (reduced agricultural share of GDP), which is associated with migration from the rural areas.  
Poor households are larger than the national average (5.6 and 4.5 members, respectively), and consumption is lower in households whose working-age adults have fewer years of education. Among poor households, the average years of education has changed very little over time (from 3.1 years in 2004 to 3.3 years in 2011), compared to education in average households (from 3.9 years in 2004 to 5.1 years in 2011). The probability of being poor is higher among ethnic minorities. 
Challenges 
While such a level of poverty reduction was a positive improvement, it is worth noting that many people are still vulnerable and even small and unexpected or undesirable shocks would easily cause them to fall back into poverty. Vulnerability of falling back into poverty is substantially high in Cambodia, which highlights the importance of socal protection and safety nets. Future poverty reduction will also depend on Cambodia’s ability to address the issue of vulnerability to poverty. Many of those who escaped extreme poverty have only just cleared the poverty line, and the poverty rate is very sensitive to small changes in the line. In this context, it is important to consider that increased consumption financed by borrowing may be masquerading as poverty reduction, and that poverty and vulnerability may be more significant than previously thought. 
Key Policies/Accelerating Strategies 
In the past, efforts have been made to enact and implement various social policies, specifically to ensure that poor and vulnerable people receive support through the establishment of orphanages, facilities for people with disabilities, maternal and newborn care centers, health services, subsidy to poor people who need treatment or child delivery service, free primary and secondary education, etc. In addition, the Royal Government established the National Social Security Fund for Civil Servants (NSSFC), the National Social Security Fund (NSSF), the National Fund for Veterans (NFV) and the People with Disabilities Fund (PWDF), to guarantee a stable income for citizens through pensions, healthcare, employment injury allowance, disability allowances and other allowances. These activities are consistent with the poverty reduction policies and the Royal Government’s socioeconomic development policies already established in other key policies, in particular the Rectangular Strategies and the National Strategic Development Plan.

The “National Social Protection Policy Framework 2016-2025” (SPPF) focuses on two main pillars, namely, Social Assistance and Social Security. The goal of this policy framework is to develop a strategic plan for the Royal Government of Cambodia to ensure income security and reduce economic and financial vulnerability of its citizens. In addition to this framework, the National Population Policy 2016-2030 also reflects its efforts to continuously improve the people’s well-being and solidarity in the society and aims at reducing poverty to a maximum extent. The policy framework aligns, concentrates and improves the existing social protection programmemes/schemes and enhances the efficiency, equity, transparency and consistency of the social protection system as a whole. Depending on the country’s level of economic growth, the current coverage, which is still considerably low, is expanded in order to respond to the needs of the citizens in all segments. A framework on governance and cross-cutting issues will also be developed to ensure the efficiency of the system and its budgetary implications. 
 
CSDG 2: End Hunger, Achieve Food Security and Improved Nutrition and Promote Sustainable Agriculture 
 
Progress 
In the absence of more recent evidence, the reporting is based on the CDHS results showing that in 2014, 32% of Cambodian children under 5 were stunted. Although this represents a significant improvement since 2010, when over 40 % were stunted, it is still considered very high based on WHO/UNICEF prevalence thresholds. Children in rural areas are more likely to be stunted than children in urban areas.

Consumption of diversified food among households is a concern as the percentage of households with low dietary diversity score was 11.6% (CSES 2014). 
Prevalence of overweight or obesity among women reproductive age increased substantially from only 6% in 2000, to 11% in 2010 and 18% in 2014 (CDHS2014). 
Challenges 
Some challenges faced include (1) the quickly changing context of Cambodia’s development status including population growth, socio-economic conditions, urbanization, migration, climate change; (2) diet quality of pregnant women and children under 5 remains inadequate; (3) public budget is needed for sustainability and private investments are still lacking; (5) increase in incidence of obesity especially among women of child-bearing age; and (6) the need to make for more diversified agricultural production and protection of natural resources crucial for agriculture, forestry and fishery. 
Key Policies/Accelerating Strategies 
The National Fast Track Road Map for Improving Nutrition (2014-2020) provides long-term direction to solve maternal, infant and young child malnutrition issues, particularly to reduce their illness and mortality rate. The National Strategy for Food Security and Nutrition (NSFSN) 2014-2018 aimed to improve physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences and optimize the utilization of this food to keep a healthy and productive life. The Mid-Term of Review of the Strategy was conducted in 2017 to incorporate the National Action Plan for Zero Hunger Challenge in Cambodia 2016-2025 and inform the preparation of the NSFSN 2019-2023. 
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries developed the Agriculture Sector Strategic Development Plan 2014-2018 to accelerate agriculture development, including enhanced agricultural productivity, diversification and commercialization, promotion of livestock farming and aquaculture, land reform and sustainable management of natural resources.  
 
CSDG 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all ages 
 
Progress 
Health status of the people has improved through expansion and increased coverage of medical facilities together with increased social health protection system and measures improve financing of the sector.  Developments within the health sector as well as sectors with direct effects on health such as infrastructure, economic growth and poverty reduction all play major roles in improving the life expectancy and living conditions of the people. Average life expectancy increased from 61.9 years in 2000 to 68.7 in 2005 (with gender average for men at 66.7 years and women 70.7 years).  
Achievements have been made towards reducing infant and maternal mortality, new HIV infection and AIDS related deaths, caused by other communicable and non-communicable diseases and risk factors affecting the health of the people. Maternal mortality decreased from 472 per 100,000 live births in 2005 to 170 in 2014. Likewise, infant mortality decreased from 66 per 1,000 live birth in 2005 to 28 in 2014. Major expansion has been made in the number of available health centers and medical staff. The number of health centers increased from 1,105 centers in 2014 to 1,205 in 2018 and hospitals from 97 to 123. There is also better availability of private clinics and pharmacies.  
New HIV infections in Cambodia haves steadily declined from 2015 and Cambodia has already achieved its target 90-90-90 before 2020. This has been recognized by the United Nation as one among only seven other countries. 
Challenges 
Despite progresses and improvements, the health sector still faces a number of challenges in terms of both epidemiology and the health system that require both short- and medium-term solutions.  
Epidemiology: Infant and maternal mortality and under 5 mortality and prevalence of malnutrition is still high if compared to other countries in the region. Lack of knowledge of sexual and reproductive health of adolescents and youth and increased adolescent pregnancies were emerging issues. HIV prevalence remain high among key population at risk to HIV infection such as entertainment workers, gay men and other men who have sex with men, transgender women and people who inject drugs, deaths from tuberculosis remains high, and high incidences of drug resistance especially for the treatments of TB and malaria remains a clinical challenge. Non-communicable diseases and growth in aging population will need to be accommodated with improved infrastructure and health service. Alcohol and drug use, insecurity, urbanization, environmental deterioration, and climate change all pose threats on the health of the population but require multi and inter-sectoral responses.

Health Systems: Major challenges faced include: (1) Health services quality remain inadequate due to limited resources, specifically, human resources, in term of the number of staff and specialists, and diagnostics and treatment ability, (2) Inadequate capacity of public health system to deal with diseases and health problems related to CDs, NCDs, mental health, and provide public health emergency response to emerging/re-emerging infectious diseases pandemics, disaster preparedness and response, (3) Investments on health infrastructure including technology and information system remains limited, (4) inappropriate health care seeking of the population, especially in rural/remote areas i.e. delay in seeking care, selfmedications, and (5) The mushrooming of private clinics also poses managerial issues for the Ministry of Health. 
Another challenge is related to a decline of funding to eliminate HIV/AIDS in Cambodia, where the preventative programmes have focused on the key population groups. The external funds support has been decreased and this is a big concern for Cambodia to reach its 95-95-95 target in 2025. 
Key Policies/Accelerating Strategies 
The Health Strategic Plan 2016-2020 (HSP3) is MOH’s strategic management tool to guide the MOH and all health institutions as well as concerned stakeholders to effectively and efficiently use their available resources to translate health strategies into action. The HSP3 renews a longterm vision of the health sector development and re-affirms the MOH’s commitment to meeting the stated vision. It outlines the strategic framework for further strengthening operations in the entire health sector (both public and private) to address priorities and to ensure consistent application of strategies across programmes. The HSP3 also contains the framework for monitoring and evaluating progress and results of its implementation. The plan also aims to mobilize adequate financial resources, inform fiscal allocation, and guide development assistance in the health sector. 
The National Strategic Plan for a Comprehensive and Multi-sectorial response to HIV/AIDS (2019-2023) is under developed while the sustainability roadmap which is the RGC’s 2013 seven-point policy on HIV/AIDS and the RGC’s 2019 policy circular 2013 are being implemented. 
 
CSDG 5: Achieve Gender Equality and Empower all Women and Girls 
 
Progress 
The National Programme for Public Administrative Reform 2015-2018 incorporates mainstreaming gender issues in the civil service, which includes mandatory training and improvements in the training curriculum for new recruits, current civil servants, and senior management. The Gender Mainstreaming Action Plan (GMAP) for the Civil Service Phase III 2014-2018 of the Ministry of Civil Service (MCS) to promote gender equality in the civil service.  
Gender Mainstreaming Action Groups are the mechanism for gender mainstreaming across sectors and by 2018 30 of 31 line ministries and institutions had developed GMAPs to guide their actions.  MOWA continues to promote Gender Responsive Budgeting (GRB) as a tool for gender mainstreaming across sectors and to engage with the MEF. In 2016, 28 government ministries and institutions received funds from the national budget and development partners for implementing GMAPs, an increase from 16 ministries and institutions in 2013. The budget for the Secretariat of Anti-Human Trafficking (NCCT) increased to 3,815 million riels in 2016.  
Women in Leadership: There has been a significant increase over the past decade. As of 2018, about 25% of members of the National Assembly and 19% of members of the Senate are women. In the executive branch, 3 Ministers, 45 Secretaries of State, and 69 Under Secretaries of State are women, representing 14.5% compared to 7.4% in 1998.  The number of women in the civil service has increased through incentives and appointments. Women represented 41% of civil servants in 2017 showing a steady increase of approximately 1 percentage point a year. There is a higher proportion of women at Sub-National Level (SNL) (from 40% in 2014 to 43% in 2017) than at national level (from 27% in 2014 to 31% in 2017). The proportion of women in Commune/ Sangkat councils reached 16.75%.  
Violence Against Women: The Minimum Standards for Essential Services for Women and Girl Survivors of Gender-Based Violence (GBV) was drafted in 2017 under the second National Action Plan to prevent Violence Against Women 2014-2018 (NAPVAW II).  It covers 10 standards including mediation as part of legal protection, health, counselling, referral and case management. Multi-sectoral Coordinated Response Mechanism (CRM) networks, involving relevant government departments and officials, were established in eight provinces in 2016 and 2017 to facilitate effective, efficient and timely responses for GBV survivors and service providers have been trained in relevant service standards.  
The RGC also developed a five-year Action Plan to Prevent and Respond to Violence against Children 2017-2021, which is led and coordinated by Ministry of Social Affairs Veterans and Youth Rehabilitation (MOSVY). In 2019, MOSVY established the Committee on Leading and Coordination for Implementation for this action plan. With national cooperation and international organizations to implement the action plans, it has made many achievements. In International context, the Government of Cambodia became the 26th member of Global Partnership of Pathfinding Country to End Violence Against Children and to engage with international community to implement the law and policy to protect children against violence, abuse, and other exploitations.

Challenges 
Social norms related to gender relations continue to constrain development of women’s potential and hinder their empowerment in economic, social, public and political life. The general attitude of rural parents towards the education of their daughters results in low participation of girls in STEM fields. Additionally, positive parenting practices are still not widely understood and encouraged.  
 
There are significant commitments to combat Gender Based Violence/Violence Against Women (GBV/VAW) and Violence Against Children (VAC). This is a long-term endeavor that requires multi-sectoral cooperation from all stakeholders to ensure effective implementation of policies, guidelines, and procedures.   
Key Policies/Accelerating Strategies 
The RGC is committed to promote positive social norms through the implementation of national laws, policies, plans and programmes at all levels. The Ministry of Women's Affairs, with partnerships and support from relevant ministries, institutions and partners, has contributed to foster gender equality in key strategic policies and reform programmes such as: 
• MOWA’s five-year Strategic Plan for Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment 2014-2018, Neary Rattanak IV (with Neary Ratanak V for 2019-2023 being developed), aims to strengthen the institutional capacity to promote gender equality through programme-based approaches and good governance. It includes comprehensive strategies to strengthen MOWA’s role as catalysts, policy advocates, advisors and facilitators for promoting gender equality. 
• Formulation of first National Gender Policy to provide a longer-term policy framework for gender equality. The policy includes a definition of gender discrimination, based on Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). 
• GMAGs and their GMAPs as a key strategy to accelerate gender mainstreaming across sectors and institutions. 
• National Action Plan to Prevent Violence Against Women sets out key priorities and actions for effective prevention of and response to GBV across multiple sectors. 
• Gender is integrated into other key strategies and policies such as: Population Policy, NSDP, and National Social Protection Framework. 
• Gender is integrated into key reform processes such as Public Administration Reform, Public Financial Management Reform, Legal and Judicial Reform, Decentralization and De-concentration, and including through National Strategy to Promote Women in Management Positions at Sub-National Level (2017-2019). 
• The Strategic Plan on Gender, Climate Change, Green Growth, and Disaster Risk Management have been integrated into the Cambodia Climate Change Strategic Plan 2013-2022 along with its implementation budget.  
CSDG 6: Ensure Availability and Sustainable Management of Water and Sanitation for all 
 
Progress 
Water and sanitation play a crucial role in the betterment of public health and the well-being of the people. There are some good progresses with regards to improving access of the rural population to basic drinking water source and services and their access to basic sanitation. Nevertheless, more effort needs to be done to meet CSDG targets. It is observable that many key policies and strategies have been put forward to accelerate this CSDG goals and targets.  
 
Surface water quality is generally good due to the efforts made by Mekong River Commission and the Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology (MOWRAM) to monitor surface water quality in Cambodia. Institutional arrangements are in place and being improved. For Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) implementation process, the MOWRAM manage water quality while the MOE has a range of responsibilities that embrace water quality protections and conducts monitoring of the water pollution.  
MIH is the key agency in designing and implementing the management of piped water supply to urban population. Indicator 6.4.1 showed that the water supply at urban areas reached 45.41%. The actual number of people surveyed keep increasing from over 3 million in 2016 to 4 million in 2018 and the trend keeps going up signifying an increase in the capacity of clean piped water supply, affordability, sustainability and coverage. Significant progress could also be seen with government initiatives to reduce water tariff rate and provide subsidy on water connection to garment workers in rented room and the poor community. The water supply service has been also privatized to improve more coverage to the rural areas. It is forecasted that the piped water supply will reach 90% of the population in 2023 and 100% in 2025.

Challenges 
Based on per capita water availability, Cambodia is not a water stressed country but the problem is related to water quality and stability of water supply at the timely manner in both wet season and dry season. Cambodia needs to development water storages and delivery system as well as capacity. Despite the government’s effort to enhance this sector, climate change is the critical challenge affecting the surface and ground water, and ability to supply clean water to the rural people. Additionally, declining fund supported by development partners, lack of participation of women, and limited financing sources to accommodate rising demand of infrastructure investment in the rural area are the other main challenges.  
Key Policies/Accelerating Strategies 
The National Strategic Plan on Water and Rural Sanitation 2011-2025 helps guide actions and implementation plans to expand connections and supply of clean water, wells and ponds, distribution of filtration tanks and installation of storage tanks. The target is that by the year 2025 all rural communities will have access to clean water and sanitation and to live in a clean and hygienic environment, eliminating open defecation which is expected to have significant effects on women and children. To achieve this, the Ministry of Rural Development has prepared the first National Action Plan for Rural Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene 2014-
2018, the second National Action Plan for Rural Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene 2019-
2023, along with the Ministry’s Rural Development Strategic Plan 2019-2023 with efforts and contributions of all stakeholders especially development partners at all levels. In addition, special cooperation effort with various international development partners such as JICA, AusAid, KOICA, and CHINA ODA will also accelerate the expansion of Piped Water Supply for all on the basis of Safe, Clean, Reliability and Affordability of Water Supply.  
CSDG 7: Ensure Access to Affordable, Reliable, Sustainable and Modern Energy for all  
 
Progress 
Efforts in the development of foundations of electrical supply are to guarantee energy security, provide and supply electricity with reliability, sustainability, affordability and resilience to the shock. Priority is given to development of power generation capacity and national network of distribution of high voltage electricity to all cities and provinces, with regional sub-stations. Up to date, there are high voltage network of 2,141 kilometers and 31 national substations covering directly 20 municipalities and indirectly 5 provinces. Cambodia is now able to produce power locally a total of 2,174 MW from hydropower dams (1,329 MW), biomass, renewable, fuel oil and solar (340 MW), and coal power plants (505 MW) plus import of 442 MW from Vietnam, Thailand and Laos.   
In 2018, 349 licensees were approved to supply electricity to 14,072 villages (99.32% of all villages in Cambodia). Infrastructure development progress include 31,356 kilometers of medium voltage network, 16,233 transformers, 32,118 kilometers of low voltage network throughout Cambodia. Currently, electrical/ infrastructure enables to supply electricity to 12, 305 villages- a 86.85% of the total villages in Cambodia. RGC has mobilized USD 22 million through rural electrification fund to support power the poor programme. So far, achievements include electricity connections and supply to 4,399 poor households, 42,040 SHS installations, and expansion and improvements of supply networks of 6,296 kilometers.

In general, Cambodia always supports clean energy development projects. However, Cambodia has not had budget allocation to subsidize the clean energy projects. In the last two years, due to reduction cost of investment on clean energy like solar, Cambodia has approved the solar farm investment with the total capacity of approximately 210 MW already. Cambodia is considering to have another 80 MW power plant from wind as well.  
Challenges 
National energy policies and strategies of Cambodia indicate alignment with the targets of Goal 7 and related CSDGs. However, significant financial resources are still needed to be invested in key infrastructures such as power station, national grid, substation, power management technology. These investments are to ensure that rural areas enable to access clean energy with accurate measurement, efficient and sufficient energy supply. Despite speedy progress of power development in Cambodia, there are a number of challenges including power sources, network connection, financial support, abundant renewable energy sources, and energy loss. Access to clean cooking fuel remains a great challenge for RGC. The target is still far behind the plan while a significant number of people still relies on wood for cooking causing indoor air pollution and having an effect on vulnerable people.    
Key Policies/Accelerating Strategies 
The Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) is updating the Power Development Master Plan and continue to develop additional power generation capacity, transmission substations and distribution networks to ensure that Cambodia has sufficient clean and sustainable energy for the growing demand. Renewable energy policy is also being developed to promote the use of clean and renewable source of energy for both thermal and electrical energy needs.    
There are two strategic targets that drive the energy development in Cambodia including by 2020, all villages to be connected to some sorts of electricity supply; and by 2030, at least 90% of all households accessed to grid quality electricity, just as if connected to the national networks. Official development assistance for Cambodia will continue to be necessary as the government has many urgent priorities that need attention with limited resources. Private sector financing will be key sources for renewable energy development and energy efficiency. Government can encourage investment by developing enabling environment (legal framework) for clean energy. Additional work to meet Target 7 will also be necessary including regional cooperation in term of power sharing through regional grid. This will allow more input from solar or wind energy which need to have a baseload covered. Energy is one of the priority sectors in IDP i.e. 
“industries serving regional production lines and those of future strategic importance such as information communication technology (ICT), energy, heavy industries, cultural/historical/traditional handicraft, and green technology.” Resource efficiency and further use of renewable energy would be a promising direction that needs informed policy decisions, incentives, investment and pilot applications. 
 
CSDG 9: Build Resilient Infrastructure, Promote Inclusive and Sustainable Industrialization and Foster Innovation 
 
Progress 
The GDP share of the industrial sector increased from 27.7% in 2015 to 32.8%, employing 23.9% of the labour force in 2018, ahead of the target. However, the manufacturing sector has increased from 16.0% of GDP to only 16.8% in this period, signifying the slower progress of the core industrial base. Construction has been the most dynamic sector, growing by about 9.8% in 2015, and by an estimated 13.7% in 2018. With international trade reaching 130.4% of GDP in 2018 (from 120% in 2015), and the boom in real estate sector in the past four years, volumes of freights going through the two major ports in Cambodia increased by 30% between 2015 and 2018, from 6.2 million MT to 8.1 million MT, ahead of target. The number of air passengers internationally and domestically also increased above the targets.  
Investment by RGC, development partners, and private sector has continued to target infrastructure, essentially roads, rail, bridges, ports, hydropower, solar farms, power transmission lines and irrigation systems. This has, to some extent, enabled garment factories to be shifted from the capital to rural areas, making it closer to labour source and relieving some burdens on urban infrastructure. RGC formulated Industrial Development Policy (2015-2025) with some 100 detail measures for addressing a range of priorities from skill to technologies to financing and facilitations for trade and investment. Cambodia has continued to receive large volume of FDI, although it has been more skewed to real estate and tourism development in the past few years.   
Population with internet access, especially through mobile phone, increased remarkably in the past few years, especially in rural areas as the telecom infrastructure has been expanded quite rapidly. In most of the rural areas, people can use 3G or 4G services on their smartphones. RGC has promoted the connectivity of backbone fiber optic cables, which have increased to 43,410 km in 2018 along with two undersea optic cable networks. The use of information and communications technology (ICT) has risen substantially as reflected in the rise in mobile phone users from 2.7 million in 2012 to 11 million in 2018 according to Rectangular Strategy IV. 
Challenges 
Cambodia is still faced with high logistics costs; relatively weak institutional coordination; lack of coherent quality infrastructure limiting producer’s access to market and enterprises’ choice of locations across the country; lack of energy development, skill development, and technologies, including digital technologies, constraining growth of the manufacturing subsector, and inadequate capacity to implement the Industrial Development Policy (2015-2025).  
The private sector has and will invest in ICT infrastructure and services where there is a strong business case and where profits can be made. However, the area where capacity is most still lacking is in rural and remote areas, especially high-speed Internet access. Table 15: Progress of CSDG 9

Key Policies/Accelerating Strategies 
A package of 17 reform measures aimed at improving Cambodia’s competitiveness, promoting SMEs and attracting foreign direct investment, was presented by the Prime Minister of Cambodia on 29 March 2019 at the Government Private Sector Forum. The measures range from reducing logistics costs to lowering electricity tariffs, improving labour law, increasing financial access to SMEs, and to finalizing the amendment of the Law on Investment, and Law on Special Economic Zones (SEZs).  
Likewise, in reforming the SMEs, Cambodia via the Ministry of Industry & Handicraft has drafted the Five-Year SME Development Plan expected to be in promulgated in early 2020. The Five-Year SME Development Plan will provide synergies to the current work attached to the IDP and the effort made by ASEAN sectoral body in supporting regional SMEs through the implementation of Strategic Action Plan on SME Development (SAP-SMED) 2016-2025 to promoting MSMEs in the region individually and collectively to realise the vision of globally competitive and innovative MSMEs.  
The Skills Development Fund (SDF) was set up in 2018 to focus on five priority areas, namely, manufacturing, construction, ICT, electronics, and tourism with an aim to bridge the skills gaps in the Cambodian economy. In the same year, RGC issued a Sub-decree to provide tax break to SMEs for up to 5 years. In addition, SME Bank and Entrepreneurship Development Fund and Entrepreneurship Promotion Centre have been created by the MEF and are expected to be up and running in 2019.  
In late 2017, MEF set up a PPP Unit aimed at boosting PPP projects that are predominantly financed by private firms in nature. It is expected that contracts could be drawn between government agency (such as line ministries) and private partners in designing, building, operating and maintaining investment projects, including BOT and concession projects, worth more than USD 10 million for management efficiency.  
With the IDP and various supporting strategy in place, the Royal Government of Cambodia has cooperated with various international partners to co-implementing various programmes and projects notably the Programme for Country Partnership (PCP) 2018-2023 with UNIDO, cooperation with various Intellectual Properties Agency, ASEAN Coordinating Committee on Standard & Quality, and the Committee on Science, Technology and Innovation (COSTI) of ASEAN to name a few. 
RGC has robust and conducive policy and regulatory frameworks to ensure affordable access and connectivity. Particularly, the Sub-Decree on Mechanism on implementation of Universal Service Obligation issued in 2017 is considered as important tool to boost the connectivity to all corners of the country as it’s a globally mechanism for bridging digital divide gap while also assist those areas, where in normal circumstances are not economically viable to build telecommunication infrastructure or the private sector has no interest to invest such as remote and rural areas. Additionally, to deliver universal digital access, the continuing an investment in infrastructure including adoptions advanced technology such as 5G and pursuing reforms are required that bring greater competition to telecommunications markets, promote public–private partnerships (PPPs) and yield effective regulation. 
 
CSDG 11: Make cities, and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable 
 
Progress 
The MOE has transferred 6 functions to sub-national level on the collection of solid waste, the management of drainage system, and natural resource protection. Actions have been implemented by the MOE, including monitoring and inspecting sources of pollution, monitoring the polluting sources from factories, piloting reporting system on the emission and movement of pollutants from other sources, and making inspection on environmental pollution violence.  
The MOE has worked to raise the awareness of using the plastic bag. It has worked with super markets and shopping centers in Phnom Penh to charge consumers who request for plastic bags for their shopping items.  
On another hand, the Ministry of Public Works and Transport has prepared a master plan on waste water and sewage system management to be implemented in major cities as a response to the RS-IV.

Challenges 
Sub-national level capacity to manage waste is still limited. There is a limited awareness on environmental protection from stakeholders and the public. Regarding environmental protection education, there are no resource centers established to provide knowledge and information on environment, and well as human resources to implement the tasks. There is also a weak level of legal enforcement.  
Key Policies/Accelerating Strategies 
Continuing partnership with DPs and the private sector is required to improve waste management. Collecting data on sources of pollution including solid wastes and liquid wastes. The management and monitoring of industrial wastes. The MOE has issued 5 sub-decrees, including Sub-Decree on Municipal Solid Waste Management, Sub-Decree on Social Environmental Fund, Sub-Decree on the Management of Electrical and Electronic Waste, SubDecree on Plastic Bag Management and Sub-decree on the Management of Sewage System and Water Treatment. 
The Royal Government has adopted and put into implementation the National Policy on Spatial planning; Law On Land Management, Urban Planning And Construction; National Policy On Spatial Planning; sub-decree on Urban Planning, Capital, Municipality and Urban Area; Participatory guidelines for Master Plan and Land Use Plan making, and some Capital Province Master Plans Master Plan; and District/Khan Land Use Planning and Approved Commune Land Use Planning 80, and under finalizing 90 Commune Land Planning. 
 
 
 	 

Case Study 3: Battambang City 
Battambang was selected as one of five pilot cities under the joint United Nations Economic and Social 
Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) and UN-Habitat project, “Integrating the Sustainable Development Goals into local action in support of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda in Asia and the 
Pacific” (2018-2021). The project focuses on advocacy and capacity development for local government and other urban stakeholders in Battambang as related to the principles, goals, and means of implementation of the 2030 Agenda, and is being implemented in Battambang with local partners from different stakeholder groups. The project will support a pilot ‘demonstration project’ in the city, which will be determined by the multi-stakeholder network. 
Battambang has selected solid waste management, livelihoods and local economic development, waste water, and affordable housing as the city’s SURM priorities. The focus on identifying integrated solutions to Battambang’s solid waste challenges is particularly relevant in the context of the targets and indicators adopted by the national government under SDG 11, which include target 11.6, to reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities and indicator 11.6.1, which is the proportion of urban solid waste regularly collected and with adequate final discharge out of the total urban solid waste generated.  
The process operationalizing the localization of the SDGs is integral, and the SURM approach thus translates for the local level the systemic issues in SDG 17, the call to strengthen institutions and multi-stakeholder involvement from SDG 16, and takes cues from other “means of implementation” targets across the SDGs. The aim is to strengthen the capacities of local governments and other key urban stakeholders to achieve effective partnerships at the city-level by promoting three integral capacity development streams: 
(i) collaborative and adaptive governance – the project aims to strengthen participatory planning, implementation, and “follow-up and review” at the local level in Battambang through the formation of an effective multi-stakeholder network, which will include stakeholders from local and national governments, civil society and community organizations, the private sector, and the research and academic community. The objective is that the different stakeholders learn and act together in meaningful partnership and thus arrive at more inclusive, needs-driven outcomes that genuinely “leave no one behind”. 
(ii) strengthening the evidence base for decision-making – the project will support targeted collection and analysis of high-quality, timely, and reliable data on Battambang’s SURM priorities, that is aligned to SDG indicators, as well as identifying and using the existing data. The aim is to support the creation of an “evidence-base” (baseline and progress measurements), which will likely include vulnerability assessments and gender analyses to help identify the most promising approaches for localizing the SDGs in each city. 
(iii) identifying integrated solutions using systems thinking – the project aims to develop the capacity of the multi-stakeholder network in Battambang to collectively analyze, plan, and implement in an integrated, systems-based manner. This entails maximizing co-benefits, creating added value through synergies, and effectively dealing with trade-offs and externalities across the three pillars of sustainable development. This capacity development stream relies on the outputs of the other streams, as the systemic approach to understanding challenges and identifying intervention points is to be done through participatory problem analysis and planning activities by the multi-stakeholder network (“collaborate”) and using the city’s new data baseline (aligned to relevant SDG indicators) to inform evidence-based decision-making and monitor progress (“strengthen evidence”). 
The main expected outcomes of the project are strengthened awareness and institutional capacities of Battambang to accelerate multi stakeholder action on the SDGs at the local level through more integrated implementation of relevant urban development and land use plans in the city.  
 CSDG 12: Ensure Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns  
 
 
Progress 
Cambodia ratified the Stockholm Convention on 23rd May 2001, and the first National 
Implementation Plan (NIP) of the Convention was prepared in June 2006 and submitted to the Conference of the Parties. According to the Convention, all parties undertake to prepare an updating of implementation plan five years after submission of the original plan. The initial NIP established four action plans, namely: (1) Action Plan on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) pesticides; (2) Action Plan on PCBs; (3) Action Plan on unintentionally produced POPs; and (4) Action Plan on the management of the NIP implementation.  
The RGC delegated the MOE to play a role as a national focal point for the Stockholm 
Convention. At the same time, in order to facilitate the implementation of the convention among relevant institutions and also to improve effective management of chemicals as well as POPs management, the Inter-Ministerial Technical Working Group-IMTWG (known as National Coordinating Committee–NCC) have been established with membership of governmental institutions, NGOs, and national institutes. 
The MOE has regularly checked pollution from factories/industries. It also provided guidance and implemented a pilot projects on reporting system on the emission and movement of pollutants as well as inspected the environmental pollution. The MOE also monitors the quality of air to check the acidic levels at 7 sites throughout Cambodia.  Table 17: Progress of CSDG 12 
 
Sources: CSDG Framework and Ministries 
Challenges 
The main challenges to achieve CSDG12 concern institutional arrangements and coordination because there are different ministries responsible for reduction plan implementation, measuring, reporting and verification. Another challenge is that CSDG indicators are limited to environmental related work while the main focuses of the SDG should be on design out waste and pollution; keep products and materials in use and regenerate natural systems.  
The use of hazardous substances, especially the mercury substances are not yet well managed in an environmentally sound manner and there is no specific government institution responsible for mercury management. The financial and technical supports are still needed to achieve the targets.  
Key Policies/Accelerating Strategies 
As seen in the progress, the RGC has adopted a number of conventions including Stockholm Convention related to the reduction of POP and Minamata Convention on Mercury for Mercury usage reduction and on 10YFP on Sustainable Consumption and Production for productive use of resources and waste prevention. Regarding the hazardous waste management, MOE has issued a number of sub-decrees including Sub-Decree on Municipal Solid Waste Management, Sub-Decree on Social Environmental Fund, Sub-Decree on the Management of Electrical and Electronic Waste, Sub-Decree on Plastic Bag Management and Sub-decree on the Management of Sewage System and Water Treatment. 
Sustainable Consumption and Production is integrated into the Environment and Natural Resources Code under the Environmental Management and Sustainability Mechanisms. The purpose is to promote the adoption of sustainable consumption and production practice as well as sustainable procurement. 
Resources efficiency is being implemented to ensure sustainable consumption and production which can be achieved with low investment cost and effort. After the approval of environmental code, the sustainable consumption and production will be integrated in different sectors including industry, tourism, energy, etc. Since SCP reflects such a significant shift away from our current ‘take-make-dispose’ culture, systemic change is necessary. This requires shifting from our traditional model of economic growth to a ‘circular economy’ approach, which is based on three things including designing out waste and pollution, keeping products and materials in use, and regenerating natural systems. 
CSDG 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine        resources for sustainable development 
 
Progress 
To conserve and sustainably use of the oceans, seas and marine resources, the RS-IV has set up the priorities such as continue implementing the National Strategic Plan on Green Growth 20132030, the Cambodia Climate Change Strategic Plan 2014-2023, the National Environmental Strategy 2016-2023, and the National REDD+ Strategy. The RS-IV also targets the improvement of the effectiveness of the environmental protection and conservation of our natural resources, ecosystem, biodiversity, forest and wildlife sanctuaries as well as adaptation to climate change, and reinforcing the management of solid waste, waste water, gas and lethal substance by implementing the ‘reduce, reuse, recycle and non-use’ principles and strengthening pollution monitoring and control mechanism. 
The MOE issued Sub-decree on Water Pollution Control in 1999 with an aim of managing quality water sources. The National Environment Strategy and Action Plan 2016-2023 was developed with an aim to identify needs and opportunities for placing the environment and natural resources sustainability as one of the centralities in the national development framework. Related to the marine and coastal protection, this strategy views that action must be taken in order to strengthen coordination in oil and gas prospecting, exploration and exploitation, transportation, coordinated emergency response capacity to potential accidents including oil and dangerous goods spills.  The strategy’s monitoring and evaluation framework, in which indicators in CSDG 14 have been included. 
The NCSD also developed the Cambodia National Adaptation Plan Financing Framework and Implementation Plan in 2017, to align with the NESAP 2016-2023, with an aim of mobilizing resources for climate adaptation activities that include the marine and coastal restoration and protection activities. The MOE also developed the Cambodia Climate Change Strategic Plan (CCCSP, 2014-2023). One of the keys strategies was to ensure climate resilience of critical ecosystems (Tonle Sap Lake, Mekong River, coastal ecosystems, highlands, etc.), biodiversity, protected areas and cultural heritage sites. 
The MAFF introduced the Strategic Planning Framework for Fisheries 2010-2019. For the inland and marine fisheries, the framework has the main objectives to support and increase the carrying capacity of the wetlands system (especially the rice fields). Targets for river and lake fisheries relate to the protection of the ecosystem services that are necessary to the sustainment of fish diversity and numbers. The key strategic interventions focus on (1) to protect and maintain the ecosystem in order to support wild capture fisheries at levels that are both, sustainable and sufficient to support demand; (2) to increase rice field fisheries; (3) to support the growth of small, medium and large-scale freshwater aquaculture; (4) to develop marine fisheries and mariculture; (5) to make improvements in post-harvest processing; (6) to promote fish and fisheries products in both national and international markets; and (7) to support livelihood diversification away from capture fisheries, especially for poor, disadvantaged and vulnerable people in order to help them out of poverty.

Challenges 
Research and development in the aquaculture are still limited and despite a lot of efforts have been made by the RGC to crack down illegal fishing activities, that issue still persists. 
Coastal resources already face a number of environmental pressures, including over-fishing and over-exploitation of forests and mangrove ecosystems that lead to increased erosion. Climate change adds to existing challenges through sea level rise, saline intrusion and coastal erosion. These contribute to the shrinking of arable land, reduction of drinking water sources and loss of coastal infrastructure. 
Key Policies/Accelerating Strategies 
The RGC will continue to build the capacity of fishery communities which have been established to ensure there are no illegal fishing for fresh water and sea water and continue to strengthen the management and conservation of sustainable aquatic resources according to Strategic Plan Framework for Fisheries 2015-2024 and political statement illegal fishing prevention. Moreover, it will enhance aquaculture production and supply by providing support to fish farms through improved technics, species, credit and market.  
 
CSDG 15: Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss 
 
Progress 
Cambodia has made a good progress on developing and implementing policies, strategies and regulations on ecosystem service. In 2015, the country established and implemented 6 policies, strategies and regulations on ecosystem services. In 2016, 2017 and 2018, the number of policies, strategies and regulations issued and implemented exceed the CSDG targets. The evaluation of forest coverage in 2016 showed that Cambodia had forest cover of 48.15% with an estimated change of 0.7% per year. In dealing with this, more and more protected areas have been established. Currently, protected areas cover 41% of the country. The establishment of National Protected Area Strategic Management Plan 2017-2031 was issued.

Challenges 
Limited capacity for implementing and coordinating works related to forest land, water and forest protection is the major challenge. Moreover, climate change, urbanization and industrialization are currently negatively affecting the country’s natural resources as well as their ecological system. In order to improve this, the RGC will increase afforestation to improve forest coverage.  
The availability of budget and facilities for implementing activities related to climate change, green growth and biodiversity protection is insufficient. Also, the policies and laws to ensure the sustainability of natural resources and environment do not sufficiently respond to today’s needs. In addition, the institutional capacity to coordinate and harmonize policies, legal documents, strategic plans, and action plans remains an issue. The population growth is the challenges in sustainable forest conservation.   
Related to climate change, there is a lack of participation from both the public and private sectors for sustainable development. Mainstreaming the principles of sustainable development including climate change, green growth, biodiversity in other sector’s strategy and action plan has not been widely done.  
The subnational level capacity needs to be built for a better planning and implementation of policies, strategies and action plans. There have been a number of conflicting cases especially dealing with land conflicts around protected areas and biodiversity conservation corridors are still to be complete. There is a lack of information and data on biodiversity. Action plan on management, allocation and demarcation of protected areas have not yet been in place to ensure the effectiveness of management, protection and conservation of biodiversity in the protected areas. 
Key Policies/Accelerating Strategies 
Preparing strategies to increase forest cover through afforestation and conservation activities as well to rehabilitate genetic resources of trees and wildlife in the protected areas and biodiversity conservation corridors is priority needed. National REDD+ Strategy 2018-2028 was issued to contribute the reduction of national and global climate change through the improvement of natural resource management and forest land, conservation of biodiversity and sustainable development. In addition, Cambodia has been implemented the REDD+ in some provinces to increase emission reductions, increase carbon stock, and sustainably manage forests as well as increase forest carbon inventory as well as develop new approaches for the development and conservation, including ecotourism and financing mechanism.  
Cambodia continues to strengthen and enhance environmental education activities through environmental extension activities, updated environmental statistics and environmentally friendly programmemes for a better biodiversity conservation and sustainable use of natural resources. 
 
CSDG 18: End the negative impact of Mine/ERW and promote victim assistance 
 
Progress 
Cambodia has made a good progress on mine and ERW although the actual achievements are generally lower than planned. The country aims at zero mine in 2025. For Goal 18.1.1, in 2016, the country has achieved 13,228 ha of land out of the planned 19,087 ha, in 2017, it achieved 14,673 ha out of the planned 19,659 ha and in 2018, 13,167 ha out of the planned 20,049 ha of landmine was cleared. The country satisfactorily achieved the reduction of mine and ERW casualties. In 2016 there were 83 cases reported out of the planned 100. And 2018 there were 58 cases of mine and ERW reported, while the target was 81. Risk Education Messages have been well implemented as planned. There is an increasing trend in the number of villages to receive the messages from 315 in 2016 to 347 in 2018. The number of mine casualties receiving right promotion were 296 persons, 314 and 320 in 2016, 2017 and 2018 respectively, which follows the CSDG targets. The number of mine and ERW casualties receiving rehabilitation services, emergency and rapid responses were just a bit lower than planned. 
 	 
Table 20: Progress of CSDG 18 

 
The Government has made efforts in providing social protection schemes and formulation of policy documents to address needs and assistance for persons with disabilities. The National Disability Strategy Plan (NDSP) 2019-2023 sets out priority policies in the implementation of reform programmes in the disability services, aimed at promoting institutional capacity and strengthening social and economic infrastructure for the creation of job opportunities for persons with disabilities, poverty reduction and development of essential works in the disability sector in Cambodia. Disability issues are also included in the National Strategic Development Plan 2019-2023, the National Mine Action Strategy (NMAS) 2018-2025, and various policies and programmes of ministries, institutions and authorities at all levels. 
Challenges 
The remaining land still affected by mines and ERW is 1,970 km2 as of December 2018. Moreover, mine and ERW funding has shown a decreasing trend because Cambodia has moved into a lower-middle income country, which requires more mine activities to be funded from domestic resources. Other challenges include  
(1) poor road accessibility to the site, both the Operators and Quality Management Teams of CMAA need to walk in the long distance to survey the site;  
(2) lack of the reliable informants and the remoteness of the areas prolonged the time spent on Baseline Survey in some villages;  
(3) restricted zones (somewhere along the borders);  
(4) most of key informants are not have time to accompany with the BLS teams due to the crop collection;  
(5) weather Condition:  wet season deny the teams accessibility to the villages or minefields; and  
(6) there is always some level of risk present in mine action even after full clearance as mines might be deeper than the set clearance depth, outside the boundaries, or just missed by clearance operations.  
Key Policies/Accelerating Strategies 
The country continues implementing mine action activities, with a focus on priority areas as stated in the National Mine Action Strategy 2018-2025, to accelerate the clearance of mine and ERW to achieve Known Mine-Free Cambodia 2025. The National Mine Action Strategy 20182025 has 8 goals (1) release all known landmine contaminated areas by 2025, (2) release prioritized cluster munitions contaminated areas by 2025, (3) address the threats from other explosive remnants of war. (4) minimize mine/ERW including cluster munitions casualties, and improve livelihood of survivors and mine/ERW affected communities, (5) contribute to economic growth and poverty reduction, (6) promote regional and international disarmament and cooperation in mine action, (7) establish a sustainable national capacity to address the residual threats after 2025, and (8) ensure mine action activities are supported by enhanced quality management system and effective information management, and are gender and environment protection sensitive. 
 
 
	Section 5: Means of Implementation  	 
 
This section discusses how Cambodia can deliver the CSDGs and how major implementation challenges can be overcome.  It draws heavily on the CSDG framework, which provides proposals for institutional arrangements and delivery choices to enable progress towards the goals. It specifically also examines how these are integrated with Cambodia’s existing planning and policymaking arrangements, so as to simultaneously promote delivery of the country’s standing development objectives.  
The section is divided into six sub-sections. First, it considers the opportunities for, and challenges faced, in successfully integrating the CSDGs within Cambodia’s policy planning system. Second, it addresses resourcing issues and practical enabling actions. Third it reviews the monitoring and evaluation arrangements, and how wider feedback (outside of government) can be secured. Fourth, it discusses why awareness-raising is important for CSDG implementation. Fifth, it examines what kind of the capacity building is needed for effective CSDG implementation. Lastly, the section concludes with a discussion of multi-stakeholder partnerships.  
5.1  	Integrating the CSDGs within the National Policy and Planning Structures 
Integrating the CSDGs within policy and resource planning in Cambodia primarily involves embedding the framework within current decision making and administrative arrangements. Two key challenges are faced: first, the need to ensure consistency and coherence between the CSDGs and plans and actions; and second, the need to prioritize between CSDG targets and to make policy and resourcing choices. 
Coherence and Consistency 
At national level, coherence will be delivered through two points of intersection: first, via the NSDP process, for which the RS IV and the CSDG Framework are the principal inputs; and second within line ministry and agency delivery management - specifically within multi-year performance-based budgets, given in Budget Strategic Plans (BSPs). These two potentials links within the planning and delivery processes are shown in Figure 8. Figure 8: CSDG Framework’s points of intersection with planning and budgeting processes 
 

First, it is envisaged that the national strategic planning process (the first box in Figure 4) would be matched to the CSDGs alongside the medium-term RS IV objectives, to define the policy approach within the National Plan, and that the CSDGs would play a major role in shaping the NSDP’s M&E framework. Additionally, these linkages might later be extended to the Public Investment Programme (PIP).  
Second, the CSDGs can play a clear role within the budget delivery performance review process, where the public financial management (PFM) reforms have established 3-year rolling budgets linked to line ministry BSP, which link budgets to policy criteria. CSDG targets and indicators are well-suited to the task of measuring impact effectiveness by offering a comprehensive set of outcome-level metrics that have already been agreed on by relevant line ministries and agencies. 
The MOP will seek to formalize and institutionalize these connections and the supporting arrangements, and ensure the 5-yearly NSDP process takes account of CSDG progress reports, and, in time, that key themes also feed through to the Public Investment Programme (PIP). Additionally, NSDP M&E metrics will include a high proportion of CSDG indicators and be regularly updated to ensure consistency, between the CSDGs and national planning priorities. The MOP will also work with MEF and line ministries to apply the framework to performancebased budgeting (within line ministry BSPs) requiring that assessments take explicit account of relevant CSDG targets. This will serve to directly link the CSDGs to service delivery outcomes. 
However, additional efforts and more significant innovations may be required in ensuring full consistency and coherence between the CSDGs and the Royal Government’s plans and actions. There are 3 dimensions to consider: 
• Temporal consistency– being the transition between the longer term (strategic) level to the medium term (policy) level and to the near term (operational) level outcomes. 
• Sectoral consistency– the application of the goals within and across functions. This is particularly important given the integrated nature of the CSDGs and possible tradeoffs and complementarities to be taken account of. 
• And geographical consistency– ensuring national, subnational and local plans are reconciled and work together for maximum impact. 
Prioritization of goals, targets and actions 
Prioritization is a key consideration for successful implementation, and given the size and the ambition of the CSDG agenda, it is inevitable and essential that some goals be given higher priority than others, this requirement is an extension of the localization/ nationalization process, but additional specificity is needed, and the RGC via national planning processes and the proposed consultation structure set out above, will seek to identify key targets and in what order they should be addressed. The MOP will identify priorities as part of the NSDP process, guided by three pointers as follows: 
• The principle of leaving no one behind, and the need to address goals, and areas or population groups, which lag others is a foremost consideration. Incomplete goals and other unfinished business under the CMDGs fall within this, and Cambodia will focus on making good on any areas where progress was not adequate (see a full list of the unmet CMDG targets in section 2). Going forward, emerging disparities and inequities will be a key marker in identifying priorities. 
• The alignment between the CSDG targets and existing and new national objectives must form the basis of Cambodia’s general prioritization approach. The use of the RS-IV and the CSDG Framework as joint inputs to the NSDP will deliver this operational prioritization. 
• Drawing on global experience and guidance, priority will be given to policy actions which serve as “accelerators” (those that drive progress across the whole CSDG agenda). This is supported by international literature and country experiences have highlighted the importance of understanding and identifying the causal interconnections within the framework. 
An awareness of these issues, alongside national aims and objectives, will provide a rigorous basis for prioritization, and MOP will seek to develop its capacity to undertake more sophisticated analysis as Cambodia progresses with implementation of policies and actions to deliver the CSDGs 
5.2  	Resourcing and enabling the goals 
This sub-section considers the steps Cambodia needs to take to identify and assemble the resources needed to deliver the CSDGs, alongside a set of enabling actions.  
It is therefore vital to recognize Cambodia’s specific resourcing constraints versus the level of ambition represented by the CSDGs, alongside Vision 2050 objectives. Delivering these will require major investments and a matching expansion in resource flows. Although the financing of the Goals will mainly be met from the national budget and ODA, given the CSDGs’ ambition and scale, there is still an important role for all actors – including the private sector, civil society and citizens themselves. Many of the Goals also require non-financial actions, including behaviour change and greater social cohesion, and these areas there is a requirement for broadbased buy-in and engagement.  
Projections from the Development Finance Assessment (DFA) undertaken by the Council for the Development of Cambodia (CDC) in 2017 underline that although Cambodia’s strong economic and fiscal performance is set to continue, including rapid increases in domestic revenue mobilization, financing challenges remain. Figure 9 shows that although government revenues (already above 20% of GDP)7 on the back of strong economic growth, are set to grow further, ODA and NGO flows will likely decline as Cambodia progress further as a MIC, and it will almost certainly be well-advanced in the process of graduating from the group of Least Developed Countries in the next decade. However, these flows still account for a significant share of the public investment budget. Going forward, public revenues will have to meet growing pressures on the recurrent budget, driven by increased expectations on public service delivery and rising public sector wages, and the gap left behind by previously ODA-supported and expanded, public investment needs. 
This will require capacity improvements and systems strengthening of the NSDP development process, and the RGC will seek to improve the analysis and forecasting of financial and other flows, by institutionalizing the DFA, and developing the analytical capacities of its core staff. MOP will also strengthen the Public Investment Programme (PIP) enabling it to function better as the Royal Government’s capital programme. This will also require further efforts to ensure stronger linkages are made between the PIP and the PFM/BSP reforms being spearheaded by the MEF to shift to programme (performance-based) budgeting and to integrate recurrent and capital budgeting. 
Figure 9: Projected Finance Flows to 2025 (low and upper scenarios) 
 
Additionally, as DFA projections also show, although private investment (domestic and foreign) will grow in line with the economy, they are likely to stabilize as a share of GDP. Yet these flows are vital to maintaining the momentum of the economy and ensuring Cambodia’s transition to higher value-added production. Economic growth remains the primary driver of poverty reduction and economic inclusion, and it provides the means of delivering higher tax revenues, which is essential for enhanced public service delivery.  
Boosting the level of investment from these sources, while also strengthening their linkages to other sectors of the economy, is a key underlying CSDG objective and is consistent with the policies of the RGC such as the Industrial Development Policy (IDP)8. The Royal Government will therefore continue to promote an investment-friendly climate while also continuing to improve the effectiveness of tax collection systems. Recognizing the distinct contribution that private sector actors can make, the RGC will also provide avenues for business, civil society and citizen-actions to contribute to the CSDGs. This includes motivating and incentivizing behavioral change in production and consumption to “green the economy”; and the RGC will consider introducing appropriate tax and other incentives. Additionally, further work to facilitate Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) to directly deliver CSDG objectives will be undertaken. The MEF has developed a national PPP policy and will now institute the necessary legislative changes to promote the viability of PPPs, initially for the provision of infrastructure, based on the retained earnings principle (i.e. Build-Operate and Build-Operate-Transfer Models). 
Finally, it is recognized that the discussion and proposed policy responses cover only the financing flows and delivery side of the equation. There is also a need to develop capacities and instruments to analyze and project the likely costs of meeting the CSDGs and hence estimate the financing needs so that these approaches can be incorporated into the national budgeting exercise. The CSDG Framework data provides only a starting position, further detailed analytical work will be needed to assess future trends and demands. 
However, past experiences with MDG cost estimation have revealed the weakness of detailed cross-sectoral costing exercises over long term periods. These generally provided inaccurate cost scenarios and were of limited value for resource and fiscal planning. Moreover, these challenges are likely to be accentuated by the expansion in the goals and the inclusion of broader developmental objectives. Nevertheless, managing and anticipating fiscal pressures remains an important consideration, and new techniques and approaches are being piloted by certain countries, notably by the Bangladeshi, Ethiopian and Pakistani governments. The MOP will explore these models and the options available, including the use of less ambitious fiscal space assessments and sector assessments over more limited timeframes (linked to programme-based budgeting and BSPs). 
5.3  	M&E and Policy Feedback 
This section sets out the key elements of the CSDG monitoring and evaluation (M&E) arrangements and summarizes issues that remain to be resolved. Recognizing modern reporting approaches and that the CSDGs reach beyond government, this section also discusses improvements to the M&E ecosystem (the environment in which wider CSDG-relevant data and information is generated and used). It refers therefore to how independent think tanks, the private sector and civil society can be included in tracking Cambodia’s progress, providing useful feedback to decision makers, and can support national dialogues on the CSDGs. 
Key Elements of the M&E arrangements 
Overall responsibility for the national M&E process lies with MOP, who is maintaining the CSDG indicator database and acting as lead technical focal point. The former task will include compiling data received and providing annual updates and five yearly milestone reports for review by the Royal Government.  
MOP’s technical responsibilities will include advising RGC stakeholders on design, estimation and calculation of indicators, data collection, and on reporting procedures and conventions. Responsibility for the specification of indicators and the provision of supporting data rests with the respective line ministries and agencies. Their capacity and data systems are urgently being strengthened through the National Strategy for Development of Statistics (NSDS), which is an important complementary initiative to designing and monitoring the CSDGs.  
In the CSDGs Framework, Chapter III in Part 1 reviews, the indicators at an aggregate level, and Part 2 (schedules 1 and 2) details the indicators, sources and data cycles to be used for M&E. Responsible actors will be required to provide up to date data to MOP on a timely basis, to enable regular reporting. Line ministries and agencies will also be required to provide a narrative assessment on progress as part of the routine NSDP review process.  
The narrative from line ministries will also provide an account of the underlying issues, and if possible, proposals to remedy any underperformance. The MOP will use a dashboard approach in reporting at target and goal level to allow rapid assessment of progress (grading targets as either green/amber/red based on the indicator data). Any proposals to amend baseline, milestone or end line values will require review and agreement by MOP as it is important that targets are not varied frequently, and values are established rigorously, and linked to defined CSDG policy objectives. 
The CSDGs Framework also identifies a number of data issues that need to be resolved, With the support of development partners, MOP in the next 12 months will undertake a goal by goal review of indicators to ensure their quality. The MOP will also organize a series of events to build SDG capacities within RGC ministries and agencies; and is considering sponsoring work to enable the collection of currently unavailable indicators. The latter will prioritize those considered important omissions to the CSDG dataset and will align with the master plan of the National Institute of Statistics. 
Improving the CSDGs M&E ecosystem 
Given the wide scope of CSDGs, and that their delivery requires the contribution of all Cambodian stakeholders and their partners, the Royal Government will also seek to build an ecosystem – supportive of wider feedback; and engage with the private sector, civil society and international organizations. This ecosystem refers to the environment (the people, connections and sources) where data is generated and used by official and non-official actors to support decision making on delivery of the CSDGs. It would, for example, include contributions based on government-generated data, by independent think-tanks to assist RGC decisions makers, and independently generated information. 
Building on practices implemented under the Cambodia MDGs, MOP, with development partners’ support, will move ahead with the following activities: 
• National campaigns to sensitize stakeholders and the Cambodian public on the CSDGs, along with communications for development initiatives to encourage mass CSDG monitoring and compliance, especially under those goals where improved consumer and producer behavior is important. This would make use of both traditional and new social media. 
• Specific engagement with businesses and private sector representatives to chart and encourage their contribution to CSDG achievement. 
• Development of CSDG policy circles and networks on thematic areas with think tanks and other CSO actors, potentially based on those sectors identified above within the CSDG NCC arrangements. 
• Sharing of official data and building of on-line portals to allow, informed users, including citizens, to engage in M&E and research, and engage in national dialogue on the CSDGs.  
5.4  	Awareness Raising 
RGC will seek to build the awareness of all actors on the topic of CSDGs, in order to promote the engagement of civil society the private sector, academia and citizens, in the implementation and monitoring of the CSDGs.  Campaigns will be carried out at both national and subnational levels, mobilizing and building partnerships, bringing together all sectors of society and boosting participation.  
As the closest level of government to the people, local administrations are well-placed to raise awareness and the relevance of the SDGs. Subnational governments bridge the gap between the central government and citizens and will play a strong role in fostering the involvement of civil society organizations, the private sector, academia and other community-based organizations. Locally elected leaders, in particular, have a democratic mandate to lead local development and can be held accountable.  
Awareness-raising activities will aim to increase the engagement of citizens and local communities in order to promote their sense of ownership of the agenda and their participation in the achievement of the SDGs at local level. Sub-national governments will be supported to recognize the 2030 Agenda as a framework for action and set up mechanisms that enable citizen participation and institutional accountability. 
5.5  	Capacity Building 
Initiatives aimed at developing or accessing skills and knowledge of civil servants are particularly important to enable SDG implementation, since capacity constraints are often identified as one of the main challenges for local administrations. Building the capacity of government officials to promote sustainable development can involve broader reforms and strengthen intergovernmental systems, leading to better governance. These measures may include enhancing capacities for strategic development and implementation, through improved planning, budgeting and financial management systems and most importantly capacity to collect and analyze CSDGs related data. 
The National Institute of Statistics (NIS), a division of the MOP is undertaking many activities to develop and implement the CSDG monitoring system including the establishment of a national implementation plan for CSDGs measurement and data collection framework. This includes improving the collection and systematization of relevant administrative data as well as to identify optimal ways to merge data from various sources. 
Specifically, NIS has been closely working with UN organizations and other international agencies to examine the potential for collecting currently missing SDG indicators classified as easily feasible to compile9,  within existing major national sample surveys (such as CSES and CDHS). As such, new survey modules will be designed and conducted. Additionally, the NIS as coordination agency of the National Statistical System (NSS) will review options for the future data collection framework (e.g. censuses, surveys, administrative data and big data) for comparative and cost advantages.   
The RGC will also continue to explore options for provision of additional support to NSS. This will include participation of development partners, especially the UN organizations, in the meetings of the Statistics Coordination Committee (SCC) and Technical Working Group on Planning and Poverty Reduction Sub-group Data for Development (TWG-PPR Sub-group D4D) to discuss financial and technical assistance needed for capacity building of the NIS and provincial statistical offices.  
Additionally, NIS will continue to work to establish a new statistical and administrative data input and dissemination/exchange tool using Stat Suite (with data based on the legacy CAMInfo platform) with support from UNSD, UNICEF, OECD and PRIS21. This new platform will cover SDG indicators and all other development related indicators. This work will include:  
 
• Building an open data and statistical ecosystem, linking with global SDG platforms, that: (a) provides platforms to enable timely collection and sharing of quality and reliable data; (b) promotes adequate disclosure and accountability of data producers; and (c) sensitizes non-government stakeholders to data as part of engagement in SDGs monitoring and implementation. 
• Supporting the adoption and contextualization of international practices and standards through development of protocols (concepts, methodologies, classifications, statistical registers, and guidelines for production, analysis, data exchange and dissemination); and supporting capacity-building to use these statistical protocols.  
• Reassessing the capacity of the NSS to compile the global and nationalized SDG indicators and to assess and measure progress toward the CSDGs in the country. 
5.6  	Enhancing Multi Stakeholder Partnerships 
The RGC recognizes that partnerships for sustainable development are multi-stakeholder initiatives, voluntarily undertaken by governments, intergovernmental organizations, major civil society groups and other stakeholders. In Cambodia, these types of partnerships are already contributing to the implementation of agreed upon development goals and commitments, as included in Agenda 21, the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, the Millennium Declaration, the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20), and the Third International Conference on Small Island Developing States. 
The RGC believes that these partnerships can make a major contribution to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and delivery of the CSDGs.  Under Goal 17, “Strengthening the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnerships for Sustainable Development”, the RGC is fully be committed to working in partnership with all relevant development partners to secure successful implementation of its policy agenda operationalized by the NSDP 20192023 and the CSDGs.  
With specific regard to partnerships with official actors, the RGC’s Development Cooperation and Partnerships Strategy (DCPS) will play a key role in efforts and relationships with all development actors. Complied with inputs of government and all stakeholders, its objectives are to mobilize and manage all forms of development finance so that resources are maximized, aligned with national development priorities, and achieve the best possible results10. 
 
 

Section 6: Conclusion 
 	 
 
Cambodia's Voluntary National Review 2019 of the Implementation of 2030 Agenda 

 
The adoption of the SDGs in Cambodia has been a comprehensive and rigorous exercise. The formal development process of the CSDGs Framework started after many rounds of debriefing sessions and fully developed after two years of concerted efforts made by ministries, agencies of the RGC, and other relevant stakeholders. The Framework includes proposals on how the goals would be integrated within Cambodia’s policy and delivery systems.  
The SDG nationalization process began with the assessment of achievements and unfinished Cambodia MDG targets and an analysis of those groups in danger of being left behind. Priority was also given to the alignment of the SDGs with national development strategies such as the RS-IV and the NSDP 2019-2023. These assessments also helped identify gaps and determine where plans and policies did not incorporate the CSDG targets.  
The RGC prepared VNR to facilitate the sharing of experiences, including successes, challenges and lessons learned, with a view to accelerating the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. The theme for the 2019 session of the High-level Political Forum of ‘Empowering people and ensuring inclusiveness and equality’ has also been central to its preparation and drafting.  The VNR focuses on six key goals including CSDG 4 (Quality Education), CSDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), CSDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities), CSDG 13 (Climate Action), CSDG 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions), and CSDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals). At this initial stage of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the VNR 2019 is an important step for the RGC to take stock of Cambodia’s progress and to engage in stakeholder consultations toward the achievement of the CSDGs. 
This review is based on a mixed research approach which consists of stock taking of the current position, desk reviews, and interviews among key stakeholders to evaluate progress, challenges, and key policies to accelerate the achievement of the CSDGs. Key documents reviewed include the RS-IV, the CSDGs Framework 2016-2030, and the NSDP 2019-2023, as well as sectoral policies and plans. These were thoroughly examined to get a better understanding of progress and challenges on the targets and indicators of each CSDG. 
The review shows that despite its early stage, Cambodia has made good progress on many fronts, and for both the six priority goals and the full set of CSDGs, most targets are on or above track.  
Data quality and management is a key challenge facing the implementation of CSDGs. Administrative data systems in many goal areas still need strengthening. In addition, like many other countries in the region, the lack of reliable data is a big challenge in judging the progress accurately as around 43% of all SDG targets lack evidence.14 As RGC moves forward with the CSDGs and implements its national development plans (NSDP 2019-20123 and sectoral development plans), enhanced support is required to strengthen ministries’ information systems, particularly in the areas where these cannot yet produce robust and disaggregated data on for CSDG indicators. 
The RGC will implement the CSDGs through the NSDP 2019-2023, using various financing sources identified in ongoing assessments of development finance and ODA. On-going PFM reforms, which strengthen the link between RGC policy, resource allocations and performance, will enable more detailed costing of programmes associated with CSDG attainment. Results-
                                                             
 
14 According to Asia and the Pacific SDG Progress Report 2019, released by UNESCAP, assessing the region SDG progress remains a big challenge as 2/3 of the global goal indicators cannot be measured due to the lack of data and insufficient information.  
based budgeting, with links to the NSDP and CSDG monitoring systems, can then be undertaken accordingly. The 2017 DFA estimated that 49% of 2015 GDP can be considered to be development finance and further resource mobilization efforts will focus on increasing domestic revenues. But, as the DFA has shown, it will also be important to maintain ODA levels and to promote private sector investment that contributes to the CSDGs implementation.   
The CSDG resource mobilization and management effort will require capacity improvements and systems strengthening of the NSDP development process. The RGC will seek to improve the analysis and forecasting of financial and other flows, which will be done by institutionalizing the DFA, and developing the analytical capacities of core RGC staff. MOP will also strengthen the Public Investment Programme (PIP), enabling it to function better as the Royal Government’s strategic capital programme. This will also require further efforts to ensure stronger linkages are made between the PIP and the PFM/ BSP reforms, and this is being spearheaded by the MEF to shift to programme (performance-based) budgeting and to integrate recurrent and capital budgeting. 
The Royal Government’s strong commitment to the 2030 Agenda has driven the VNR process. This commitment underpins the institutional arrangements set up for the CSDGs as well as their integration into the national planning frameworks. Going forward, the Royal Government will continue to engage a broad array of stakeholders to address the challenges identified in this report, learn from past lessons, and consolidate achievements as the country moves towards the realization of the NSDP 2019-2023, the Sustainable Development Goals and Vision 2050.
