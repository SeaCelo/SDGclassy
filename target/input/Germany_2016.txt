INTRODUCTION 
The globalised world we live in is characterised by numerous and complex interdependencies. These are times of great challenges, and overcoming them will determine the future of humankind and the planet. But we are also living in a world of new and diverse opportunities. The adoption of Transforming our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was a milestone in the recent history of the United Nations. This comprehensive and universal Agenda is an expression of the conviction that global challenges can only be tackled through concerted efforts and by systematically applying the principle of sustainable development across all policy areas and in every country.  
With this Agenda, the world is affirming its interdependence and providing a guiding framework for overcoming the crises. We have laid the foundation for bringing about worldwide economic progress that respects social justice and the planet’s carrying capacity. Now we must put it into practice. Sustainable development is about assuming responsibility – now and for future generations, nationally and internationally. And it means political, economic and social change and sustainable action at global, regional and national level. We could be the first generation that succeeds in eradicating poverty, and the last that has the chance to save our planet. 
Promoting sustainable development is one of the German Government’s fundamental goals in all its activities. Germany can already look back on a tradition of sustainability: the government’s first National Sustainable Development Strategy was presented in 2002. The key principles guiding its national sustainability policy are intergenerational equity, quality of life, social cohesion and international responsibility. Germany committed to an ambitious implementation plan for the Agenda from the outset, immediately taking important first steps towards national implementation and declaring at the summit in 2015 that it would report on implementation at the High-level Political Forum (HLPF) in 2016. With this report, we would like to promote open exchange among all states and encourage others to present at global level their contributions to the achievement of the global objectives. In this way, we want to support a process of mutual learning. Germany also has to work hard to implement the 2030 Agenda and benefits from the experiences and transparency of others: ”With the 2030 Agenda, the global community has taken on a considerable challenge for the next 15 years. The German Government is fully committed to implementing this Agenda in an ambitious manner. In Germany too, we are in some respects a long way away from achieving sustainability in the way we live, the way we do business, and the way we manage natural resources.“ (Federal Chancellor Dr Angela Merkel, government policy statement, 24 September 2015.) 
In this report we present the process to date, explain how we dealt with each SDG, and outline the thinking behind each German contribution. 
 
 	 
National approach to implementing the SDGs 
The National Sustainable Development Strategy provides a key framework for implementing the Agenda in Germany. Work on revising it in the light of the 2030 Agenda’s ambition and goal structure is scheduled to be completed in autumn of 2016. In the revision process, the German Government has placed particular importance on addressing the three dimensions of sustainable development – social, environmental and economic – in a balanced manner and on clearly outlining the global impacts of national policies through closer consideration of the international dimension. The transformative character of the SDGs calls for high levels of coherence and broad consultation within the government. Implementing a genuine multi-stakeholder approach means involving non-governmental actors in accordance with their respective roles. To this end, the existing participation formats are being reviewed.  
The comprehensive involvement of non-governmental stakeholders is a key concern of the German Government, and it is promoting this through a variety of dialogue formats. In keeping with the spirit of a new global partnership, the German Government is broadening the process of dialogue with these actors for the ongoing revision of the National Sustainable Development Strategy. Non-governmental stakeholders were also consulted in the process of producing this report, and were able to discuss their ideas with the government. The German Government will also give a representative of non-governmental stakeholders the floor for a statement on their behalf during Germany’s national voluntary review presentation.  
 
State of implementation 
For the German Government, the universal applicability of the Agenda means making appropriate contributions to meeting all 17 sustainable development goals – both in its national policies and internationally. To this end, national implementation approaches have been defined in all policy areas at three levels: firstly, with regard to implementation and impacts in Germany; secondly, with regard to impacts in other countries and on global public goods – i.e. on global well-being; and thirdly, with regard to supporting other countries through international cooperation. The German Government has identified measures for achieving each of the SDGs at all three levels.  
In doing so, the Government aimed to address national challenges, such as achieving gender equality and protecting biodiversity, as well as the energy transition (Energiewende), which also plays a key role in the implementation of the Paris Agreement.  
Concurrently, the Government deliberately focussed on identifying measures that require action in Germany while at the same time contributing to global well-being. In addition to the energy transition, our Resource Efficiency Programme and our policy on sustainable supply chains are examples of how Germany is taking responsibility for the global impacts of its actions at national level. Industrialised countries play an important role in the global development of sustainable consumption and production patterns and in increasing resource efficiency. Germany attaches great importance to this area and has, for example, set itself a national goal regarding the market share of products with ambitious environmental and social labels, and has launched a National Programme for Sustainable Consumption.  
In international cooperation, Germany remains a reliable partner and supports other countries in their efforts to implement the SDGs. The 2030 Agenda is the new compass for the German Government in international cooperation with developing countries and emerging economies. Germany would like to strengthen transformative, cross-sectoral approaches and assist partner countries in mobilising and making effective use of their own resources. Mobilising domestic income plays an important role for developing countries, and is being supported, for example, by the Addis Tax Initiative (ATI). Germany will double its support for the mobilisation and effective use of national domestic income in developing countries by 2020. Furthermore, in keeping with the pledge that no one is to be left behind, there is also a focus on combating the structural causes of hunger, undernourishment and malnutrition, and eradicating extreme poverty. The fact that global sustainable development without lasting peace is an illusion must always be taken into account. Therefore, Germany promotes conflict prevention, stabilisation and sustainable peacekeeping bilaterally as well as within the United Nations. Germany remains committed to the goal of dedicating 0.7% of GNI to ODA within the time frame of the 2030 Agenda; the German Government therefore plans to increase spending on development again in 2017 and, in addition, aims to double international climate financing by 2020 (relative to 2014).  
 
The way ahead 
Germany can build on existing experience in many of the areas mentioned above. However, it also still has a lot to do in order to achieve the SDGs. Implementing the Agenda means bringing about a comprehensive transformation in all areas of life. And for this, a new culture of sustainability is needed.  
The report presents the German implementation approaches for all 17 SDGs as outlined in the draft new edition of the National Sustainable Development Strategy. This draft is currently being discussed in consultations with non-governmental stakeholders and further governmental actors (parliaments, federal states, local authorities). It will be revised on the basis of these consultations and subsequently be adopted by the German Cabinet in the second half of 2016. For some of the issues that would merit the inclusion of a corresponding national goal in the National Sustainable Development Strategy, suitable indicators have yet to be defined; however, the intent is to develop these indicators. Following the next regular progress report on the National Sustainable Development Strategy scheduled for 2020, Germany plans to participate in the national voluntary review at the HLPF in New York in 2021 for the second time.  
 
 	 
FULL REPORT 
The adoption of the comprehensive 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development “Transforming our World” was a milestone in the recent history of the United Nations. This comprehensive agenda is a reflection of the conviction that global challenges can only be tackled through concerted efforts that must be based on the principle of sustainable development applied systematically across all policy areas and in every country. The international community has unequivocally stated that resolute action must be taken in order to achieve a transformation towards sustainable development. Global and universally applicable sustainable development goals (SDGs) indicate how we can reduce poverty, improve living conditions worldwide, and protect our planet. The simultaneous implementation of the SDGs and the Paris Agreement on climate change provides us with a great opportunity to achieve the transition to sustainable, lowemission lifestyles and economies worldwide. 
“With the 2030 Agenda, the global community has taken on a considerable challenge for the next 15 years. The German Government is fully committed to implementing this Agenda in an ambitious manner. In Germany too, we are in some respects a long way away from achieving sustainability in the way we live, the way we do business, and the way we manage natural resources.“ 
Chancellor Angela Merkel  
Government policy statement delivered on 24 September 2015 
 
Sustainable development means assuming responsibility – both for the present and for future generations, nationally and internationally. To make this happen, the 2030 Agenda calls on governments, the private sector and society to change tack and put their actions on a sustainable footing at global, regional and national level. Germany committed to ambitious implementation of the Agenda from the very outset and has already taken first steps towards putting it into practice at national level. The German Government is aligning its actions with the five core elements of the 2030 Agenda: People, Planet, Prosperity, Peace, Partnership. 
For the German Government, the universal applicability of the 2030 Agenda means that it will make appropriate contributions towards meeting all 17 sustainable development goals - both in its national policies and internationally.  
It is therefore considering its involvement in terms of the impacts on three levels:  
* Firstly, with regard to implementation and impacts in Germany,  
* Secondly, with regard to impacts in other countries and on global public goods, i.e. on global well-being (worldwide impacts – e.g. from trade or climate policy), and  
* Thirdly, with regard to supporting other countries (our international cooperation policy). 
 The 17 goals, and also these three levels, are closely interwoven and cannot be considered in isolation.  
 
When this report was drawn up, the German Government took its lead from the guidelines of the United Nations Secretary-General, which it found helpful, and which it believes ought to be updated in the light of experiences gained at the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) 2016. 
 
1. Our starting point: general information on Germany’s national context 
1a) The status quo in Germany 
According to figures published by the United Nations in the 2015 Human Development Report’s Human Development Index, Germany ranks sixth of the 188 states and territories listed. In the United Nations Gender Inequality Index, which covers 155 countries, Germany ranks third. According to the Global Footprint Network, Germany has an Ecological Footprint1 of 52. According to this calculation model, 3.1 planets would be needed to provide the resources required if everybody in the world were to live and work the way the Germans do. This puts Germany in the top quarter of all countries in terms of its ecological footprint. Furthermore, while the most recent Indicator Report on the National Sustainable Development Strategy, published by the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) in 2014, identified a slight overall improvement, shortcomings were noted in a number of fields, including resource conservation, biodiversity, indebtedness, mobility and agriculture2. 
Thus, while Germany has on the whole achieved a very high level of development, further efforts are needed to meet the SDGs at national level and in this way also make appropriate contributions to meeting the goals globally.  
 
1b) The existing National Sustainable Development Strategy  
Promoting sustainable development is one of the German Government’s fundamental goals in all its activities and the yardstick it uses to measure them. As early as 2002, the government presented its first National Sustainable Development Strategy. Since then, it has reported on its implementation status every four years in the form of progress reports that also update the strategy’s content. The preparation of the progress reports is always accompanied by a broad-based process of dialogue and consultation with civil society groups. The National Sustainable Development Strategy has included national sustainability goals and indicators since the very outset in 2002. They allow for a regular measurement of progress and help to identify any wrong turns in policy. Every two years, the Federal Statistical Office publishes an independent Indicator Report with information about progress towards meeting goals.  
The National Sustainability Strategy provides practical guidance on how the principle of sustainability is translated into the work of the German Government. Since its inception, it has developed a highly differentiated sustainability management system: procedures, bodies and instruments that are designed to guarantee that the guiding principle of sustainable development is applied throughout the work of the government. 
The State Secretaries’ Committee for Sustainable Development steers implementation of the Sustainable Development Strategy and oversees the updating of its content. It comprises representatives from all the ministries and is chaired by the Head of the Federal Chancellery. The committee provides strategic input for the work of the German Government and acts as a forum for the different government departments to share information on their sustainability activities at a high level. The committee invites external experts from the private sector, the scientific and research community, civil society, and from the federal states and local authorities to attend its meetings. It selects a so-called “beacon project” every year in recognition of especially exemplary innovative activities of the various ministries. 
The Parliamentary Advisory Council on Sustainable Development works to support the German Government’s National Sustainable Development Strategy and raises policy-related sustainability concerns in parliament. The Council also formally reviews whether the sustainability impact assessment of draft legislation of the government has been conducted in a plausible manner, and it regularly holds public hearings and publishes policy papers to trigger debate on various aspects of sustainable development. 
The German Council for Sustainable Development, an independent advisory panel, has been supporting the German Government since 2001. It consists of 15 figures of public life who, by virtue of their professional and personal background, represent the economic, environmental and social aspects of sustainable development in its national and international dimensions. The Council has two important tasks: it advises the German Government on all issues related to sustainable development and it fosters dialogue on sustainability within society.  
Sustainability Impact Assessments are used to examine every draft item of legislation and legal ordinance proposed by the government against the objectives, indicators and management regulations laid out in the National Sustainable Development Strategy for the impacts they can be expected to have on sustainable development. 
With its Maßnahmenprogramm Nachhaltigkeit (programme of measures for sustainability) the federal administration has also undertaken to align its actions with the imperatives of sustainability. This applies, for instance, to building construction and facility management, procurement and mobility, but also to achieving a healthy work-life balance.  
The key principles guiding the national sustainability policy are intergenerational equity, quality of life, social cohesion and international responsibility.  
Due to the sustainability principle’s high political significance and its cross-cutting approach, the Federal Chancellery is the lead agency for the National Sustainable Development Strategy. However, all government departments have the primary responsibility for their own contributions to implementing the National Sustainable Development Strategy and the 2030 Agenda in their respective policy fields. 
Regularly, government action requires prior consultation among all relevant federal ministries and the Federal Chancellery. This procedure, although time-consuming, ensures that the German Government resolves problems of conflicting objectives internally, and that the entire government then backs the actions of every ministry. The implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the measures laid out in more detail below is carried out within the framework of the budgetary and fiscal requirements of the Federal Government.  
In Germany’s federal system, the federal states and local authorities are responsible for making and enforcing laws in important areas relating to sustainable development. Two thirds of all federal states already have their own sustainability strategies or are currently in the process of producing a strategy of this sort. Regular meetings of federal and state governments are held to enable participants to share their experience of sustainability activities. 
The sustainability management system put in place by the National Sustainable Development Strategy is a major factor in the success of German policy in the field of sustainable development. In order to make still more progress, independent peer reviews of the German Government were conducted in 2009 and 2013; each review was conducted by eight recognised international experts and supported by the German Council for Sustainable Development. The experts analysed Germany’s sustainability policy and issued strategic recommendations, which were then incorporated in the updating of the strategy.  
The National Sustainable Development Strategy is currently being thoroughly reviewed and updated in the light of the 2030 Agenda, under the aegis of the Federal Chancellery. 
Germany’s sustainability architecture has become increasingly differentiated over the last 14 years, and has largely proved its worth. Nevertheless, this architecture will have to be modified and extended, in particular to enable Germany to implement the 2030 Agenda at national level. 
 
1c) Dialogue with civil society groups 
When seeking to implement proposed measures, especially before amendments to legislation, the German Government engages in a dialogue with stakeholders and other relevant parties. This creates an opportunity to explain the proposed measures and enables stakeholders to articulate their ideas, criticisms and suggestions for improvements. This dialogue is also indispensable to ensure rights-based accountability. Furthermore, it often improves the quality of government actions and increases public acceptance of decisions.  
In the field of sustainability as in many other fields, there is a long tradition in Germany of involving civil society actors. Throughout the process of updating the National Sustainable Development Strategy, citizens have been and will continue to be involved both via the Internet and through hearings which allow various interest groups to present their points of view. Embracing the spirit of a new global partnership, the German Government has put the process of dialogue with these actors on the updating the National Sustainable Development Strategy on an even broader footing. At the same time, the German Government is looking for ways to take the interests and concerns of civil society into account to an even greater extent in the future.  
For many years, the German Government has also organized a dialogue forum held three or four times a year in order to facilitate a regular exchange of ideas and information on the international sustainability agenda between the government and representatives of NGOs, churches, local authorities, the scientific and academic community and the private sector. Youth delegates for sustainable development bring the views of future generations into the national debate and also accompany government delegations to relevant negotiations and to the HLPF. In addition to these youth delegates, the German delegation to the HLPF also includes representatives of the private sector, trade unions and environmental and development associations. 
The Charter for the Future is a further attempt to involve civil society actors, especially in the dialogue to promote global sustainable development. Since 2014, discussions have been held with the involvement of over 100 organisations and initiatives and members of the public on how to create opportunities for the future for everyone worldwide, and establish what responsibility we in Germany can assume in this respect. In an open online dialogue and numerous special events, proposals were advanced which were subsequently complied in the form of a Charter along with recommendations. A nationwide tour brought these issues to a wide audience. The Charter was submitted to the Chancellor, generated impetus to make the new National Sustainable Development Strategy more international in its outlook, and is helping to implement the 2030 Agenda by initiating multi-stakeholder partnerships. A large number of sector-specific dialogue forums are also in place. The German Government uses these regularly and on a case-by-case basis to engage with concerned civil society groups.  
 
1d) Ongoing support for other countries  
German development policy in recent years has been systematically geared towards improving global framework conditions in the environmental, social, economic and political sense in order to eliminate the causes of poverty and promote global sustainable development. Following the adoption of the 2030 Agenda, the political priorities of our policy are oriented towards its five core areas (People, Planet, Prosperity, Peace, and Partnership). German development policy focuses in particular on:  
(1) Combating the structural causes of hunger and malnutrition and ending extreme poverty;  
(2) Creating sustainable opportunities for the future, particularly for young people, and tackling the root causes of displacement (especially through education/training, employment and investments in the green economy, social infrastructure and good statehood); 
(3) Making globalisation equitable, in particular by promoting fair trade and income and job opportunities that ensure sustainable livelihoods (with particular emphasis on promoting responsible supply chains and minimum social and environmental standards); 
(4) Promoting sustainable development in the private sector, private investment and the ability of the partner countries to contribute financially to their own development;  
(5) Climate change mitigation and adaptation and conservation of natural resources. 
 
Promoting good governance and gender equality are cross-cutting tasks that are also an important element in the bilateral and multilateral dialogue on development policy. In line with the new Global Partnership for Sustainable Development, the German Government is aiming to cooperate with its partners on an equal footing and to continually improve efficiency and effectiveness. These principles are being implemented through numerous bilateral and multilateral initiatives and programmes. 
 
In addition to the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development and the Federal Foreign Office, numerous other federal ministries are actively involved in international cooperation. 
 
The International Climate Initiative (IKI) of the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB) has been specifically funding climate and biodiversity projects in developing countries and emerging economies since 2008, along with projects to implement the SDGs. 
The Vision Zero Fund, a global fund initiated by the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (BMAS) and supported by the G7, mobilises practical support for poorer producer countries in their attempts to improve health and safety in the workplace.  
 
ODA percentage: Germany’s ODA (Official Development Assistance) has increased steadily in recent years; the OECD’s latest ODA estimate for 2015 shows continual increases to around 16.0 billion euros3. That makes Germany the third-largest donor in absolute figures; Germany’s ODA rose from 0.38% of gross national income (GNI) in 2013, to 0.42% of GNI in 2014 and 0.52% of GNI in 2015. About 0.09 percentage points of the increase recorded between 2014 and 2015 were accounted for by the costs of providing for refugees in Germany, some of which costs are classified as ODA. Spending on development cooperation continues to be one of the German Government’s top priorities. It has increased its spending several times in recent years and a further rise is planned for 2017. The German Government has also specifically promoted the involvement of the private sector in order to mobilise additional funding and implementation support (from various sources (public and private, national and international, including innovative financing and instruments)), which are then available to support sustainable development in developing countries. 
 
Active involvement in regional and international fora: For many years, the German Government has also proactively advocated strengthening sustainability policy in regional and international fora. As a member of the World Bank and the OECD, it is calling for the activities of these organisations to be aligned more closely to the imperatives of sustainable development. At the European level, Germany is pushing for an ambitious approach for implementing the 2030 Agenda, inter alia through a revision of the EU’s sustainability strategy and its CSR strategy, as well as revising the EU Consensus on Development. The German Government would like to strengthen the key role played by multilateral development banks in generating and leveraging financial resources, developing innovative instruments and disseminating knowledge, especially in the fields of climate change mitigation, health care, food security, crisis prevention and conflict transformation, addressing the root causes of displacement and stabilising fragile states. Within the G7, Germany is pushing for the ambitious implementation of the SDGs and, under the German Presidency in 2015, made an important contribution with its commitment to climate change mitigation: the G7 is aiming to decarbonise the global economy by the end of this century and put its energy sector on a new footing by 2050 in order to limit global warming to well below 2° Celsius, ideally to 1.5° Celsius. The G7 states are also aiming to apply labour, social and environmental standards more rigorously in global supply chains and have set themselves the goal to free 500 million people in developing countries and emerging economies from hunger and malnutrition by 2030. Also within the framework of the G20, the German Government is pushing for the across-the-board implementation of the SDGs, and is urging all member states to engage more strongly at national level, for example through national sustainable development strategies. The German Government will translate this into more specific terms in the course of the German Presidency in 2017 and will push for a stronger alignment of the G20’s work with the 2030 Agenda. 
Germany also has a seat on the Steering Group of the European Sustainable Development Network (ESDN). And last but not least, the German Government was an active member of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals, sharing a seat with the governments of France and Switzerland. 
 
Review: As a member of the OECD, Germany is involved in the regular peer reviews of the development cooperation of the members of the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee (DAC). About once every five years, the policies and performance of individual members are reviewed. The review reports assess the overall performance of members. The review embraces both policies and implementation, and looks at progress made on putting into practice recommendations of previous reviews. Germany’s last DAC peer review was conducted towards the end of 2015, and resulted in 14 recommendations; work on implementing these is ongoing.  
 
2.  Details on how this report was produced: process, participation, methodology, structure  
With the 2030 Agenda, United Nations member states agreed to “engage in systematic followup and review of implementation” of the Agenda.5 The fundamental principles for follow-up 
																																																												
5	2030	Agenda,	paragraph	72	
and review are already laid out in the 2030 Agenda: it is to be voluntary, country-led, participatory, transparent and effective. It is to embrace all dimensions of sustainable development and look at the means of implementation, as well as being evidence-based, building on sound data sources and pursuing a multi-level approach.4 The United Nations Secretary-General has drawn up guidelines with which this report complies. As one of the 22 first countries to report to the HLPF, Germany aims to strengthen political dialogue and mutual learning within the HLPF. Germany, too, can benefit from the experience and transparency of other nations. 
 
2a) Focus of the report 
The aim of this report is to describe the steps the German Government has already taken and those it plans to take in the future to implement the 2030 Agenda. The report includes details of the preparatory implementation endeavours, the processes involved in adapting our policies and the way in which all stakeholders are included in the implementation process. In this sense, it describes the path Germany has taken to reach the goal, but it also makes initial statements about specific details, experiences and priorities. It reports in detail on all 17 goals of the 2030 Agenda. The work on a statistical annex, which will be submitted to the United Nations after completion, is still ongoing. Updates about work progress are accessible via the following link: http://www.destatis.de/SDG. Germany will submit data on the global set of indicators at regular intervals in order to contribute to the United Nations’ international comparison of data. 
 
2b) The involvement of state and non-governmental actors  
It was important to the German Government to involve non-governmental stakeholders in the preparation of this report. It was discussed with representatives of NGOs, churches, local authorities, the scientific and academic community, the business community and the trade unions in the dialogue forum on the 2030 Agenda, where these non-state actors had the opportunity to engage in a critical exchange of views with government representatives and to suggest changes to the report. A representative of non-governmental stakeholders in Germany is also scheduled to speak when this report is presented to the HLPF in New York. This is intended to send the clear signal that the implementation of the 2030 Agenda in Germany is driven by a “whole of society” approach. 
 
3.  What the SDGs are changing in Germany: steps and contributions towards implementation  
3a) Integrating the Agenda and its SDGs into national implementation  
The German Government has decided that the new National Sustainable Development Strategy is to provide a key framework for the implementation of the sustainable development goals in Germany. The reworking and updating of the existing National Sustainable Development Strategy in the light of the goals and ambitions of the 2030 Agenda is planned to be completed by late 2016. In October 2015, the Head of the Federal Chancellery fired the starting shot for work on the new edition of the National Sustainable Development Strategy at a public conference in Berlin. By February 2016, four public regional conferences had been held, attended by state-level ministers, state secretaries and other representatives of federal, state and local governments, as well as a large number of stakeholders from the business community, the academic and research community, civil society and non-governmental organisations. In addition to the panel discussions, the 1,200 or so participants were able to voice their own ideas and proposals regarding the implementation of the 2030 Agenda in workshop settings. The results of the initial conference and the four regional conferences will be taken into account in the finalization of the new German Sustainable Development Strategy.  
The Federal Government, led by the Federal Chancellery and involving all ministries, has prepared the draft of the new edition of the National Sustainable Development Strategy. This strategy was presented by the Federal Chancellor on 31 May 2016 at the annual conference of the Council for Sustainable Development and simultaneously published on the Internet. The public can comment on the draft over the course of several weeks, both orally at a public hearing in the Chancellery as well as in writing. In autumn 2016, the revised National Sustainable Development Strategy is scheduled to be adopted by the Federal Cabinet. The next indicator report on the strategy will be published in 2018. The next progress report is envisaged for 2020. 
 
Implementing the 2030 Agenda at three levels   
3-a- aa) Measures with impacts in Germany  
The strength of the 2030 Agenda is that it brings together all the dimensions of sustainable development; the social, environmental and economic dimensions. The implementation of the 2030 Agenda by the German Government will therefore require the joint efforts of all ministries, and consistent compliance with the provisions of the 2030 Agenda in all policy fields. The German Government has set itself the goal of implementing the 2030 Agenda in its entirety in Germany.  
In preparing the new edition of its National Sustainable Development Strategy, the German Government is engaging with each individual SDG and defining the need for action relevant for Germany in that particular field. The aim is for the international dimension of Germany’s actions to also be incorporated.5 For every SDG there is to be at least one indicator-based political objective. They reflect areas in which Germany can make important contributions towards achieving the SDGs. Not all targets and international indicators are to be incorporated in the National Sustainable Development Strategy, partly because not all are appropriate (because they are simply not relevant in the German context) and partly because Germany’s own objectives and targets in some areas are further-reaching and more ambitious. National indicators should thus be seen more as key indicators which identify and reveal where relevant action is needed in the respective area, without making claims to comprehensively reflect all of its aspects. The German Government is also contributing to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda with the help of a wide spectrum of measures in the individual sectors. 
When elaborating objectives and indicators, every ministry analysed the areas in which action will need to be taken in view of the SDGs now agreed. The integrated nature of the SDGs means that responsibility for each individual SDG cannot be vested in any one ministry, but that all ministries affected by an SDG must work together, and produce joint proposals on ways of achieving the goal. 
Looking at the new objectives and indicators as a whole, the German Government is taking care to ensure that implementation is ambitious both domestically and in the light of Germany’s international responsibility. 
 
3-a-bb) Germany’s engagement for the global level  
With the 2030 Agenda, the world acknowledged its interdependence. Worldwide sustainable development can only be achieved if every state takes steps that benefit not only its own nation, but the entire global community. It calls for measures to be taken worldwide at national level that advance the global public good and structural frameworks for sustainable development. An extensive transformation will be needed in all aspects of life if the 2030 Agenda is to be implemented. 
 
The new edition of Germany’s National Sustainable Development Strategy pays more attention to the impacts of our actions beyond national borders. This applies, for instance, to our activities to fight poverty and hunger, as well as efforts to protect the global environment and climate, German entrepreneurial activities, respect for and realisation of internationally accepted human rights standards (especially in global value and supply chains), worldwide efforts to combat illegal financial flows and money laundering, and activities to promote transparent and independent certification systems.  
- For environmental and climate policy reasons, the German Government is working to usher in a global energy shift – or “Energiewende” as we say in Germany: a move away from fossil fuels towards renewable energy, greater energy efficiency and an overall reduction in energy consumption.  
- Sustainable development is a key issue for German entrepreneurial activities around the globe. Germany is producing a national action plan on business and human rights in order to strengthen corporate social responsibility and foster respect for and realisation of internationally accepted human rights responsibilities. The decision of the heads of states and governments of the G7 states at Elmau (2015) on “Responsible supply chains” also guides action in this area: “We strongly support the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and 
welcome the efforts to set up substantive National Action Plans. In line with the UN Guiding Principles, we urge private sector implementation of human rights due diligence. We will take action to promote better working conditions by increasing transparency, promoting identification and prevention of risks and strengthening complaint mechanisms.” 
- In order to respect the planetary boundaries and achieve a more socially equitable form of globalisation, more sustainable lifestyles and production methods are needed worldwide, as well as protecting and conserving biological diversity, reducing the absolute consumption of resources, raising resource efficiency, and respecting the core labour standards and international social, environmental and human rights standards along global supply chains. Transparent and independent certification and quality seal systems can help consumers to recognise products produced using sustainable methods, thus enabling them to make an informed decision when they buy. The precondition for achieving sustainable lifestyles and production methods is the existence of a functional regulatory framework that creates genuine incentives to increase sustainability. The guiding principle of sustainable development must also manifest itself in administrative action. This is not only because the public sector must lead by example; its activities also have relevant impacts on the three dimensions of sustainable development. Therefore, the Federal Government is committed to strengthening sustainable public procurement. 
- In efforts to fight illegal financial flows, Germany will ensure that the German economic and financial system is not misused for the purposes of criminal activities, including money laundering, tax evasion and corruption. Germany is thus taking steps to ensure effective internal legal assistance (including the return of unlawfully acquired assets) and is supporting other countries with requests for legal assistance. The recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to address money laundering and the financing of terrorism are also being implemented; the provisions of the UN Convention Against Corruption have already been implemented in full. 
Germany’s engagement for the global level is laid out in detail for each individual SDG (see below). 
In addition, the German Government is actively involved in a wide variety of ways in international and multilateral organisations and initiatives involved in implementing the SDGs.  
 
3-a-cc) International cooperation for sustainable development  
International cooperation for sustainable development is an integral part of Germany’s implementation of the 2030 Agenda, and also aims to support other countries in their efforts to realise the Agenda. The Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), which is responsible for development policy and development cooperation, has begun to reassess its development policy in the light of the 2030 Agenda, as well as re-examining procedures and processes. Thereby, in particular, transformative, cross-sectoral approaches and greater partner country ownership as well as a recognition of responsibility for the global public good by other states shall be strengthened.  
 
Germany remains committed to the goal of dedicating 0.7% of gross national income to ODA within the timeframe of the 2030 Agenda. The German Government thus intends to raise development spending again in 2017. Germany is working with its EU partners to have between 0.15 and 0.20% of gross national income earmarked as ODA for the least developed countries (LDCs). Concurrently, Germany is pursuing a comprehensive and integrated approach in order to mobilise all possible stakeholders as well as financial resources and other implementation support from all possible sources (public and private, national and international, including innovative financing and instruments) with a view to supporting sustainable development in developing countries.  
Germany aims to double its international climate finance by 2020, taking 2014 as a base year.  
 
The rising need for common global action calls for strong and united action on the part of multilateral cooperation, with the goal of improving the international framework for sustainable development, gearing multilateral organisations to the promotion of sustainable development around the globe, and ensuring that they make the best possible use of their comparative advantages. In its capacity as a member of the United Nations, the EU and the OECD, as well as other international organisations, and as one of largest shareholders in the World Bank and regional development banks, Germany is supporting the necessary reform and strategy processes within these organisations. Without a strong and efficient United Nations, there can be no solution to global problems. Germany is actively supporting the reform of the UN development system and is pushing for an anchoring of reform projects within the scope of the Quadrennial Comprehensive Policy Review negotiations.  
As a member of the European Union, Germany is working on a new strategic EU framework to realise the 2030 Agenda. The German Government is in favour of an EU strategy on sustainable development. The 2030 Agenda is to be taken into account in all strategies affecting more than one policy field, including the EU’s global strategy for foreign and security policy and the EU trade policy strategy. Germany has successfully pushed for a revision of the EU Consensus on Development, which dates back to 2005, in the light of the 2030 Agenda. Discussions have already commenced. In an effort to strengthen the philosophy of sustainability at a practical level and on a very broad front across Europe, the European Sustainability Network (ESDN) organised the European Sustainable Development Week (ESDW) for the first time in 2015. More then 4,000 projects in 29 countries took part in this first year. It is now to become a regular event, and will be held from 31 May to 5 June every year. 
 
3b) Multi-stakeholder approach 
Implementation will only be successful if we all pull together. The inclusive approach of the 2030 Agenda is at the heart of implementation: for the German Government this means mobilising civil society engagement and involving a wide variety of stakeholders in line with their relevant roles in implementation, and in the monitoring and follow-up. All parties are called on to get involved – federal states, local authorities, the private sector, trade unions, the science and research community, associations, foundations and NGOs, and consumers. The federal government is engaged in regular dialogue with the 16 federal states on matters relating to sustainable development, and in particular on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. The federal states, for instance, have participated in the new edition of the National Sustainable Development Strategy, with a contribution approved at the level of the states’ prime ministers, in which they stress the need for cooperation between the federal, state and local governments. Eleven of the federal states already have their own sustainability strategies or are currently working on such a strategy. The German Government is also looking at ways of involving the concerns of civil society to an even greater degree. 
 
In multi-stakeholder alliances, including the Partnership for Sustainable Textiles6, the German Water Partnership7, the National CSR Forum with representatives of the German Government and the Deutschland Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (D-EITI)8, the German Government is already fostering cooperation with a wide spectrum of civil society actors. The contributions of the local authorities and rural districts, which have significant authority as a result of Germany’s federal structure, allowing them to make important contributions to implementation, are also supported by the German Government, for example the initiation of municipal partnerships.9 With the Alliance for Sustainable Procurement and a Competence Centre for Sustainable Procurement, the German Government also encourages dialogue between the federal, state and local governments on putting public procurement on a new footing to favour sustainably produced goods. 
 
In the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, the private sector also plays a vitally important part in mastering global challenges, alongside the countries’ own efforts. Private businesses can generate important impetus to implementing the 2030 Agenda, if they integrate sustainable development into their business models. The German Government thus involves the private sector, which it considers to be a key actor, in sustainable development efforts. Currently, the German Government is actively involved with the private sector at international level within the UN Global Compact, and in Germany with, for instance, the German Initiative on Sustainable Cocoa and through the development of a national action plan for business and human rights. 
 
The German Bundestag’s Parliamentary Advisory Council on Sustainable Development fosters discussion in parliament relating to sustainable development. 
The German Council for Sustainable Development organises numerous campaigns to encourage dialogue within society on the principle of sustainability, and to put the philosophy of sustainability into practice. The establishment of what are termed Regionale Netzstellen Nachhaltigkeitsstrategien (regional network points for sustainability strategies) is designed to strengthen the nationwide networking of sustainability initiatives launched by federal, state and local governments. The German Council for Sustainable Development also supports the international networking of councils for sustainable development and similar stakeholders. One example of this is an international conference which the German Council plans to host in November 2016. 
 
3c) Cross-cutting issue and 2016 thematic focus area – leave no one behind 
“Leave no one behind“– this principle runs through the entire 2030 Agenda. Over the 15 years to come, even greater efforts will be needed in order to reach population groups suffering disadvantages or discrimination inside Germany and worldwide, and to improve their situation on a sustainable basis.  
At national level, a legal framework is provided by the 2006 Allgemeines Gleichbehandlungsgesetz (General Act on Equal Treatment), which aims to prevent and eliminate the disadvantaging of individuals as a result of their ethnic background, gender, religion or world view, disability, age or sexual identity. Individuals affected, having been disadvantaged on any of the above grounds, can seek information and support from various sources including the independent Federal Anti-Discrimination Agency (ADS). 
Gender equality is one of the 17 goals of the 2030 Agenda, as well as a cross-cutting issue applicable to all goals. Genuine gender equality is one of the central challenges that Germany must successfully master if it is to become forward-looking, successful and equitable. For this, women and men must have the same opportunities throughout their lives, in the personal sphere, in their professional and working life, and in the family. Currently, a second German Gender Equality Report is being elaborated, which is to be published in 2017. It builds on the first report, which was published in 2011, and will look at a number of issues including finding a first job, careers, founding a family, and caring for family members at home. The report will show the way forward for the German Government’s gender equality policy. 
At international level, the German Government supports the rights and development opportunities of women and girls, children and young people. 
Numerous measures support the members of minorities, people with disabilities, individuals living in isolated areas and indigenous peoples. Germany’s contributions to the SDGs are part of the country’s fundamental human rights commitments, because Germany sees the realisation of human rights for all as the central factor in promoting sustainable development worldwide.  
Within the framework of Germany’s international cooperation, and in multilateral processes, the extended human rights-based approach is realised, for instance through human rights and equal opportunities strategies, and action plans on gender equality and the rights of children and youth. A development policy action plan on the inclusion of persons with disabilities is to help ensure that all individuals contribute to the common good in line with their individual abilities, and that they can obtain the services provided by society on an equal basis. 
The impacts of the complex SDG targets on all sections of the population can only be identified if the implementation of the goals and targets in all relevant spheres can be verified with the help of convincing and disaggregated indicators. In Germany’s opinion, this makes the disaggregation of data according to a number of relevant factors, including gender and age, an important element in achieving all goals. Disaggregated data provide the necessary information on how measures affect different people to a different degree and in a different way, providing a basis for well-founded decisions. This is essential to ensure that no one is left behind.  
Reducing inequality remains a challenge that is now being addressed in a more strategic manner. In the field of international cooperation, Germany is supporting programmes that aim to reduce inequality, e.g. employment promotion activities that target the bottom 40% of the income scale. Other measures target fiscal policy in partner countries and help establish social security systems. Equal opportunities are promoted by facilitating access to and improving the quality of services in a number of sectors, including health, education, water, social welfare and energy, as well as promoting gender equality directly and indirectly. 
 
4.  Report on the goals and associated targets  
On the following pages, this report presents Germany’s approaches to implementing all 17 SDGs as they are laid out in the draft new edition of the National Sustainable Development Strategy. The draft is currently being consulted with non-governmental stakeholders who are invited to add their comments and ideas. In autumn it will be revised on the basis of these civil society consultations and subsequently adopted by the Cabinet. The SDGs are universally applicable and have been defined so that they can guide the actions of every country within its relevant national framework. Germany is making relevant contributions to achieving all SDGs on the basis of its capacities and circumstances. 
 
 
SDG 1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere  
With the 2030 Agenda, the international community has set itself the ambitious goal of completely eradicating extreme poverty by 2030. The 2030 Agenda states that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions is “the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development”.  
Progress towards achieving Goal 1 will send a very strong signal. But to achieve SDG 1, it will be crucial to make progress on all other SDGs. Efforts to achieve SDG 1 must ensure that no one is left behind; i.e. we will have to redouble our efforts in order to reach disadvantaged groups and individuals around the globe.   
 	 
National challenges 
The focus of the German Government’s national-level policy to achieve SDG 1 is, alongside the constitutionally guaranteed entitlement to the minimum sociocultural standard that would enable a person to live in dignity, to combat relative poverty in the form of restricted opportunities to participate. Poverty, thus understood, is a challenge, even for a wealthy nation like Germany. Single parents and people living in households with low work intensity are worst affected. Employment that generates an adequate income is the most effective means of fighting poverty. The German Government is undertaking the following activities: 
• Poverty avoidance through decent wages: The introduction of an across-the-board minimum legal wage in 2015 was an important step towards improving the income situation of workers in the low wage sector. The situation is evaluated at regular intervals and appropriate action can be taken as required. Since women previously accounted for almost two thirds of workers earning less than the minimum wage, they have benefited disproportionately from the introduction of the minimum wage.  
• To make it easier to reconcile family and professional commitments, childcare facilities are being expanded, to give one example. Other steps to improve the income situation of women involve building on the “Elterngeld Plus” and “Partnerschaftsbonus” parental benefits scheme (which enables parents of young children to work part time and share the responsibility of looking after their children) to encourage fathers and mothers to share family commitments more equally, enabling both partners to take up gainful employment, as well as creating fixed-term part-time working opportunities. 
• Poverty-resistant old age pensions, to ensure that the social welfare system remains “poverty-resistant” for future generations. The German Government thus plans first and foremost to strengthen company pensions schemes.  
• Protection against poverty through a minimum level of protection: Where it is not possible to earn an adequate income, Germany provides state support such as income transfers to prevent poverty. In Germany, taxes and social transfers reduce the risk of poverty by 74%10. Cash payments for families help them bear child-related costs, protect them from poverty, and enable children from low-income families equal access to education and participation in society. 
• Access to affordable housing is also promoted. 
 
Global responsibility 
Within the framework of the bilateral cooperation of the German Government, sustainable poverty reduction is the overarching goal. Poverty is seen as a multidimensional phenomenon in line with international standards.  
• Germany affirms its global responsibility and helps in all policy fields to eradicate all dimensions of poverty worldwide.  
 
 	 

• Structural and suprasectoral approaches to poverty reduction: Germany supports partner countries, for instance, in promoting inclusive economic growth and employment, improving access to education and health services, and building social welfare systems (health insurance, basic income, pensions). Special attention is paid to rural regions and to promoting agriculture. It is becoming increasingly important to strengthen the resilience of poor people and countries to the consequences of climate change and environmental destruction. 
 
Experience/challenges: The evaluation of development policy by the OECD DAC Peer Review in 2015 indicated a conflict of objectives between the political will to concentrate efforts on the poorest countries, and the desire to select the most effective and efficient development measure in each case. The Peer Review also pointed out that the comprehensive realignment to management for results remains a challenge. Ultimately, greater efforts will have to be made over the next 15 years, in order to reach disadvantaged or discriminated groups and women, perhaps by fine-tuning or adjusting political guidelines, further developing the instruments used, or reviewing selection mechanisms.  
 
The present draft of the National Sustainable Development Strategy 2016 envisages that national sustainability indicators and goals/measures concentrate on: Building on SDG 1.3, the German Government is reviewing the determination of indicators in the social welfare system.  
 
SDG 2: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture  
Today, almost 800 million people worldwide still go hungry, while two billion suffer from micronutrient deficiencies, or hidden hunger. Sustainable, resilient, innovative and productive agriculture is key to global food security. This 
is also essential if we are to ensure that ecosystems remain intact and that soil retains its fertility in all countries. This is why, during negotiations, Germany pushed to have food security and agriculture linked in one and the same sustainable development goal. The German Government supports the international human rights-based approach to the right to food and sees food as a fundamental right. Hunger and malnutrition are not only the result of insufficient production, but also the consequence of distribution problems. 98% of those who go hungry live in developing countries. This means that food security and the establishment of sustainable and resilient agriculture are focuses of the development activities of the German Government. 
 
 	 
National challenges 
When implementing SDG 2 in Germany, the focus is on ensuring better and more balanced diets. Agriculture depends on natural resources like no other branch of industry, and thus has a special responsibility to manage these resources sustainably. In view of existing challenges (e.g. improving animal welfare, protecting and managing ecosystems, preserving biodiversity and ensuring that it is managed sustainably, reducing nutrient surpluses), additional steps are needed to move towards a broader understanding of sustainability.  
Activities with effect at national level are concentrating on:  
• a national action plan on healthy eating with a wide range of initiatives and information; 
• implementing the National Action Plan on the Sustainable Use of Plant Protection Products; 
• elaborating a future strategy for organic farming with a target of having at least 20% of land farmed organically within the foreseeable future.   
 
Global responsibility 
At global level, the German Government is working in particular for the following:  
• Correcting and preventing trade barriers and distortions. To give an example, the German Government is endeavouring, within the framework of the WTO, to reduce tradedistorting subsidies in the agricultural sector; at the tenth WTO Ministerial Conference, agreement was reached on the elimination of direct export subsidies in the agriculture sector. 
• Ensuring that food markets function properly. Strong price fluctuations that harm producers and consumers, especially in developing countries, should be limited. In this context, the German Government supports moves within the WTO to regulate export restrictions more robustly, since these magnify undesirable price volatility on agricultural markets. And Germany is actively involved in the Agricultural Market Information System (AMIS) launched in 2011 by the G20 states.  
• Preserving genetic diversity and using it sustainably. Germany has established a national network to preserve genetic resources, and its central gene bank for crop genetic resources is an institution of international repute. The government promotes the development of European and international networks and global initiatives, also within the scope of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA) and the Global Crop Diversity Trust (GCDT). It also promotes investment to establish and develop regional and international genetic resources banks in partner countries.  	 
The German Government is working in particular for the following: 
• Ending hunger: The fight against hunger is a priority of international agricultural policy and German development cooperation. The German Government earmarks around 1.5 billion euros every year for development activities in the fields of agriculture, rural development and food security. Under the German Presidency in 2015, the G7 states agreed to free 500 million people from hunger and malnutrition by 2030. 
• Improving the quality of food; about 70 million euros were dedicated to fighting malnutrition in women and young children in 11 countries (under the special initiative One Word, No Hunger). 
• The rule of law, including property rights and equal access to resources and financial services for all, especially by promoting the elaboration, implementation and enforcement of international legal standards and guidelines (Principles for Responsible Investment in Agriculture and Food Systems (PRAI), Voluntary Guidelines for the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries, and Forests in the Context of National Food Security (VGGT), OECD/FAO guidelines).  
• Increasing sustainable agricultural productivity, partly by establishing 13 green innovation centres and specifically promoting agricultural research in developing countries; also by supporting the international Wheat Initiative.  
• Ensuring the sustainability and resilience of food systems: sustainable agriculture must seek to reconcile the divergent demands of resource management and protection, production and health protection. In an effort to reconcile these conflicting objectives, knowledge sharing is promoted, as well as the development of possible strategies and technology transfer. The German Government supports climate-smart agriculture as well as the integrative nexus approach to make use of synergies in the fields of water, energy and food security. 
• Retaining and enhancing soil fertility, partly by financing measures (currently in the amount of around 93 million euros) to rehabilitate 200,000 hectares across five countries (within the framework of the special initiative One Word, No Hunger). 
• Promoting socially acceptable structural change in rural areas with investment in building agricultural value chains in country as well as sustainable rural services and infrastructure with employment and income opportunities.  
 
The present draft of the National Sustainable Development Strategy 2016 envisages that national sustainability indicators and goals/measures concentrate on:  (a) nitrogen surplus and (b) organic farming. 
 
 	 
SDG 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages 
Good health is an objective of, a prerequisite for and a result of sustainable development. Respecting, promoting and guaranteeing good health is a human rights obligation. One central factor in this is ensuring that all people have access to affordable health care of an acceptable standard (universal health coverage or UHC).  
 
National challenges 
The German health system is often seen at international level as an example to be followed in order to achieve universal health coverage. The concept of prevention, which is integral to the goal, is the priority of Germany’s health policy. The Preventive Health Care Act, adopted in mid-2015, steps up health promotion and preventive health close to the citizens, i.e.in schools, pre-school childcare facilities and at the workplace, while the services offered by health insurance schemes in order to detect and diagnose diseases at an early stage are being further developed, and the interplay between health promotion in the workplace and occupational health and safety are being improved. The environmental policy of the German Government also serves to protect the population from harmful influences in the environment in the form of chemicals, contamination of air, soil or water, and noise pollution. 
 
Global responsibility 
At global level, Germany is working for the following in particular:  
• A global health policy and the strengthening of health systems, especially the fight against the spread of transnational health hazards. The framework for inter-ministerial work is provided by the German Government’s strategy entitled Shaping Global Health – Taking Joint Action – Embracing Responsibility. The road map Healthy Systems – Healthy Lives, initiated jointly by Germany and the World Health Organization, is an important measure. 
• Improving international crisis management when epidemics strike, partly by supporting structural reforms (UN High-level Panel on the Global Response to Health Crises) and developing solutions to address the risk of global pandemics (e.g. the World Bank’s Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility) and contributions to the WHO emergency funds. 
• Strengthening the World Health Organization in its overarching and coordinating role in global health architecture. Germany is the third largest contributor to the regular budget.  
• Health and environmental protection in bilateral and multilateral cooperation. 
 
 	 
In cooperation with developing countries, the targets that build on the Millennium Development Goals are still the priority fields of action (“unfinished business” of the MDGs, including improving maternal and child health, ensuring access to sexual and reproductive health services and realising reproductive rights, as well as eradicating and fighting communicable diseases). Within the framework of negotiations and international initiatives, the German Government is actively involved, for instance, in efforts to promote a rights-based approach to family planning and maternal health, comprehensive sexuality education and access, especially for young people, to sexual and reproductive health services, to better link sexual and reproductive health services and HIV/AIDS work, and in the field of sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI). Comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) is a central concern of the German Government. This should include age-appropriate explanations of human rights, sexuality, gender equity, partnerships and sexual and reproductive health on the basis of scientifically founded and value-free information.  
• The Initiative on Rights-based Family Planning and Maternal Health supports partner countries in efforts to increase the use of modern contraceptive methods, and helps ensure that no birth is unwanted and that every birth is attended by health professionals.  
• The German Government aims, with the help of Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance, to vaccinate 300 million more people by 2020, and to save 8 million lives and prevent 300 million new infections with the projects financed by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM). 
• Research activities on neglected and poverty-related diseases are being clustered, coordinated with G7 partners and the necessary data is being made available.  
 
The present draft of the National Sustainable Development Strategy 2016 envisages that national sustainability indicators and goals/measures concentrate on: (a) premature mortality; (b) smoking rate; (c) obesity; (d) pollutants in the air; (e) exposure to particulate matter. 
 
 
SDG 4: Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all  
The education people are given largely determines the opportunities open to them, and enables them to develop their individual skills, realise their professional goals and participate in society. Education is a human right. 
High quality institutionalised education and an enabling environment in society that allows individuals to learn successfully even outside educational institutions are crucially important. The German Government accords special importance to education for sustainable development. 
National challenges 
The education level in Germany is rising consistently. One challenge is that the educational and future opportunities of young people are still frequently dependent on their social background, and on the educational level of their parents.  
The German Government is working for the following: 
• Education for sustainable development. To implement the internationally agreed processes, the German Government has launched a political process and put in place a new structure in which the federal and state governments, parliament, the academic and research community, the business community and civil society are represented. In early 2017, a national action plan is to be adopted anchoring sustainable education in all parts of the education sector (e.g. by integrating it into curricula and training regulations).  
• Early childhood education, partly by promoting research and taking measures to improve equality of opportunity for children, e.g. agreeing on a quality process in day care, promoting language education and upskilling specialists to provide parents with the support they need.  
• Enhancing the work-life balance by improving childcare services and encouraging fathers and mothers to share family responsibilities, allowing both parents of young children to work, partly through the Elterngeld Plus parental benefit scheme with its Partnerschafts-
bonus, which allows parents to receive parental benefit for a longer period, provided both partners scale down their working hours in order to share the responsibilities of childcare.  
• School education that provides for children and young people with and without disabilities to learn together, partly by training and upskilling pedagogical experts in inclusive education. An education monitoring scheme that draws on a number of different instruments (PISA, PIAAC, education reporting) provides a precise overview. 
• Technical and vocational education and training, providing support for young people to help them make the transition from school to working life/vocational training.  
• Comprehensive literacy within the framework of the UN Literacy Decade, especially to motivate adults in the low skills group to pursue further learning. 
• Improving equality of opportunity in the education system, for instance by decoupling educational success from the social background of the learner and by promoting children and young people from high-risk backgrounds. To this end, there is a focus on extending and enhancing the quality of early childhood education, promoting language acquisition and reading skills, fostering passion for scientific subjects, and (out-of-school) cultural education.  
• Inclusive education building on the national action plan to implement the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. One measure is an initiative of the Federal Government Commissioner for Matters relating to Disabled Persons which awards a prize to schools considered exemplary in enabling children with and without disabilities to learn together. 

Global responsibility 
Germany attaches particular importance to open exchange in the education sector and considers itself a promoter of education services not only through activities outside Germany but also by opening the German education system to learners from other countries. To achieve goal 4b, the German Government has committed itself to increasing the number of students studying science, technology, engineering and mathematics subjects (STEM-subjects), as well as the number of research scientists from developing countries in Germany. The German Government is supporting UNESCO in implementing its Global Action Programme on Education for Sustainable Development at global level. 
 
Support for other countries 
Developing countries are receiving support to help them gear their education system to the guiding vision of lifelong learning, in particular by:  
• Providing support in the fields of extended basic training, university education and technical and vocational education and training. Henceforth Germany will invest a minimum of 400 million euros a year in education measures; the regional focus is on Africa, with special attention paid to areas affected by fragile statehood and conflict. 
 
The present draft of the National Sustainable Development Strategy 2016 envisages that national sustainability indicators and goals/measures concentrate on: (a) 18-24 year olds with no formal qualifications; (b) 30-34 year olds with tertiary or postsecondary non-tertiary qualifications; (c) all-day childcare 
  
SDG 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls  
Achieving gender equality and empowering women and girls around the globe are key factors for sustainable development. The way women and men actually live is more diverse today than ever before. Nevertheless, there are 
still drastic differences between women and men, and opportunities are far from equal, be it in terms of choice of occupation, founding a family or the likelihood of becoming a victim of violence. Modern gender equality policy aims to give people the chance to take charge of their own lives irrespective of their gender. 
 
National challenges 
The German Government’s current gender policy priorities are in the following areas: 
• Increasing the number of women working outside the home and making it easier for women and men to reconcile family and professional commitments by encourag-
ing both partners to share family responsibilities with the introduction of the Elterngeld Plus and Partnerschaftsbonus parental benefits scheme (which enables parents of young children to work part time and share the responsibility of looking after their children), while also improving childcare services and introducing a legal entitlement to part-time work for a limited period. There are plans to better enforce the principle of equal pay for equal work or work of equal value as well as making occupations that have traditionally been seen as “women’s jobs” more attractive. The Act on Equal Participation of Women and Men in Executive Positions in the Private and the Public Sector, which came into effect in May 2015, marks an effort by Germany to significantly raise the percentage of executive positions held by women, with a view to achieving gender parity in the medium term. 
• Combating violence against women and girls. About 25% of women aged between 16 and 85 in Germany have experienced physical and/or sexual violence at the hands of partners at least once in their lives. By the end of 2017, Germany plans to ratify the 2011 Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (Istanbul Convention) and thus, among other things, to improve the protection afforded to women that guarantees them the right to sexual self-determination. 
• Closing the gap between women and men in terms of educational opportunities, partly by increasing the number of top-level women academics and scientists and partly by the National Pact for Women in MINT professions (which boasts more than 200 partners from the realms of politics, business, the science and research community and the media). Girls’ Days and Boys’ Days also give young people a look behind the scenes in jobs that have traditionally been dominated by the other gender.  
 
Global responsibility 
The German Government will continue to implement the United Nations Security Council resolution number 1325 on Women, Peace and Security along with the follow-up resolutions, and demands that women be involved on an equal basis in foreign and security policy, crisis prevention and conflict transformation, and that women be better protected in armed conflicts. Germany also intends to use its Chairmanship of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to forge ahead with the Women, Peace, Security Agenda. And within the framework of the United Nations, Germany is helping to translate international regulations into more specific terms through an initiative focusing on the rights of victims of human trafficking. In 2012, Germany joined the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings and is involved in the monitoring and implementation mechanism. At international level, Germany has accepted responsibility for the practical arrangements of implementation with one German Vice-President in the Bureau of the UNWomen Executive Board, and one German Vice-Chair in the Bureau of the Commission on the Status of Women. Germany also led negotiations at the sixtieth session of the Commission on the Status of Women on the 2030 Agenda and its link to women’s empowerment. 
 
 	 
Support for other countries 
• The strategy Gender Equality in German Development Policy lays out binding directives for Germany’s state development cooperation, which is to take a three-pronged approach: gender mainstreaming, the empowerment of women and girls, and the systematic mainstreaming of women’s rights and gender equality in development policy dialogues.  
• Germany is currently supporting numerous projects and programmes with the primary objective of gender equality. The strategy Gender Equality in German Development Policy is binding for the design of all German state development cooperation activities and is implemented through a Development Policy Action Plan on Gender Equality (2016-2000) and annual road maps. In 2013, a total of 42% of Germany’s bilateral ODA services included gender equality and the empowerment of women as the primary objective or as a significant objective (as compared to an average of 33% among DAC member states).11 The central concerns of these projects are to give women access to the law and to the courts, to ensure their political participation, give them a say and ensure they are represented, as well as overcoming and preventing gender-based violence. German development cooperation is also supporting gender equality in the fields of economic promotion, rural development and food security, peace and security, education, health and climate change. A total of 22 projects currently have gender equality as their primary objective; for 2016, pro-women projects worth 2.3 billion euros are planned.  
• Special support for women and girls: Within the scope of its G7 Presidency in 2015, Germany launched the G7 initiative on Women’s Economic Empowerment. The G7 states agreed to increase by one third the number of women and girls in developing countries receiving vocational training through G7 measures by 2030, with a view to enhancing their participation in economic life. 
 
Within the framework of the OECD Peer Reviews, Germany’s experience is that progress can be made on cross-cutting issues like gender by strengthening managerial competence and using appropriate instruments. 
 
The present draft of the National Sustainable Development Strategy 2016 envisages that national sustainability indicators and goals/measures concentrate on: (a) the gender pay gap; (b) women in managerial positions in the private sector; (c) the number of women and girls in partner countries of German development cooperation with vocational qualifications. 
 
SDG 6: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all 
Water is the precondition for all life as well as being indispensable for food production and daily hygiene, as a habitat for flora and fauna in the form of oceans, lakes, rivers and wetlands, and for leisure pursuits. Water is also a source of energy, a means of transport and a raw material, making it an important factor in economies. Water is thus one of the most important resources we have, and we must use it with great circumspection and protect our water reserves. Every sort of water use leaves traces. Discharges of various substances, withdrawal of water and civil engineering interventions change the quality and quantity of our water, also our groundwater. This makes it important to reconcile different sorts of water use (to protect surface water, groundwater and oceans). 
 
National challenges  
While access to safe drinking water and to sanitation – universal human rights – are guaranteed in Germany, the main focus of implementing SDG 6 at national level is on improving water quality (6.3). With the exception of drinking water, which is already classed as having good or very good quality, significant efforts will still have to be made. The EU Water Framework Directive lays out the targets for good chemical and ecological water quality for surface water and good chemical quality and quantitative status of groundwater at European level. The provisions of the directive must be implemented in Germany by 2027. By 2015, however, a total of 82% of all bodies of surface water and 36% of all bodies of groundwater had still not attained a good condition in line with the definitions of the Water Framework Directive. The main reasons why surface water bodies failed to qualify as being in a good ecological state were civil engineering works, the straightening of water courses and obstructing installations that interrupt flowing water. Water failed to meet the standards for good chemical quality as a result of high levels of nutrients, primarily phosphates in the case of running water, as well as contamination with ubiquitous substances like mercury; permissible mercury levels were exceeded across the board in water bodies. The Water Framework Directive also calls for cooperation between states on international river basins. 
 
Global responsibility 
Within the framework of processes and initiatives of the United Nations, at regional level, for instance in transnational water commissions, and in the form of strategic partnerships with individual countries, the German Government is working to improve water supplies and sanitation, improve water quality and water efficiency, and implement the principles of integrated water resources management. The German Government is working for the following, to give some examples: 
• A UN coordinating body to strengthen the global monitoring, reporting and verification of water-related goals. 
• The development of a global, indicator-based monitoring system for water quality and water resources management. 
• The management and further development of a global database of water quality data within the framework of the UNEP programme GEMS Water.  
• Promoting the Global Water Partnership (GWP) to more robustly implement the principle of integrated water resources management worldwide. 
• Promoting the Water Integrity Network (WIN) to enhance transparency and performance in the water sector. 
• Promoting the integrative approach of the SDG within the scope of the water, energy and food security nexus. 
• Introducing resolutions within the framework of the United Nations (United Nations Human Rights Council and the Third Committee of the General Assembly) on the right to safe drinking water and appropriate sanitation, which also addresses the special needs of women and girls. 
• Developing and testing forward-looking technologies and transferable concepts on the sustainable management of water as a resource through the research promotion programmes Globale Ressource Wasser (Global Resource Water) (GROW) and Zukunftsfähige Technologien und Konzepte zur Erhöhung der Wasserverfügbarkeit durch Wasserwiederverwendung und Entsalzung (Viable Technologies and Concepts to Raise the Availability of Water by Re-
using and Desalinising Water) (WavE). 
 
Support for other countries  
Around the world the German Government is the second largest bilateral donor in the water sector. In more than 20 countries, the water sector is a priority area of bilateral development cooperation. Germany is supporting governments in connecting households to water networks and assuring the proper operation, maintenance and management of pipe networks. In addition, measures are increasingly being implemented to enhance the economic efficiency of utilities, including reducing economic and physical water losses and improving energy efficiency. The International Climate Initiative is making an important contribution to projects in the water sector that are relevant for the CO2 balance. The central focus is on the sustainable use of water resources by establishing national and transnational authorities, and improving water quality, partly with the help of comprehensive wastewater management.  
 
The present draft of the National Sustainable Development Strategy 2016 envisages that national sustainability indicators and goals/measures concentrate on: (a) total phosphorus/phosphate discharge into flowing water; (b) nitrates in the groundwater; (c) number of people gaining access for the first time to drinking water and sanitation through German support. 
 
SDG 7: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all  
A secure, affordable and environmentally sound energy supply is a key prerequisite for successful social and economic development. The way in which energy is produced and consumed has a significant influence on the parameters of sustainable development and the attainment of the SDGs. The decarbonisation of energy systems, based on renewables, energy saving and maximising energy efficiency, is therefore the guiding principle of Germany’s national climate and energy policy, external energy relations and energy-related development policy. 
 
National challenges 
Germany has succeeded in recent decades in cutting energy consumption despite rising economic output, while also substantially increasing the share of renewables in gross final energy consumption. The increased levels of renewables supply and the improved efficiency have further reduced net dependence upon fossil energy imports from abroad. 
SDG 7 is implemented at the national level through the energy transition (Energiewende), which provides the framework for sustainable energy policies with long-term goals. The energy transition is also a key component of German climate policy.  
Specifically, this means that: 
• Total primary energy consumption is to be reduced by 20% by 2020 compared with 2008, with a 50% reduction target for 2050. Gross electricity consumption is to decrease by 25% by 2050 against the 2008 baseline. Final energy consumption in the transport sector is to be reduced by around 40% by 2050 compared to 2005 levels. Primary energy consumption in the building stock is to be cut by 80%, making it nearly climateneutral by 2050.  
• Germany has set itself the goal of increasing the share of renewables in gross final energy consumption to at least 60% by 2050, with interim targets of 18% for 2020, 30% for 2030 and 45% for 2040.  
• A renewables share in Germany's gross electricity consumption of at least 35% is to be achieved by 2020, with at least 80% reached by 2050. 
• Decarbonisation of energy supply in the transport sector will require not only the expansion of renewables and the development and promotion of electricity-based fuels, but also the development of alternative forms of mobility. 
• Germany’s energy research is consistently focused on renewable energies and efficiency technologies. For example, through its Energy Research Programme, the German Government has provided around 3.4 billion euros to promote research and development of modern energy technologies. 
 
Global responsibility 
• The national energy transition is a key element of Germany’s climate policy. It is firmly embedded in the European framework and is implemented in cooperation with our international partners.  
• In addition, the German Government plays an active role in numerous multilateral organisations, forums and initiatives in order to contribute to the international dialogue on sustainable energy for the future. This takes place, for example, in the G7 and G20 frameworks, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the International Energy Agency (IEA), the UN’s Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All) initiative, the Africa-EU Energy Partnership (AEEP), the Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century (REN21), the Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM) and the World Bank’s Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP).  
• The German Government also supports the mobilisation of private capital via various tailor-made funding mechanisms (e.g. GET FiT, Geothermal Risk Mitigation Facility (GRMF), Renewable Energy Cooperation Programme (RECP), RE DEVCO and the Regional Liquidity Support Facility). In addition, the German Government advocates at the national and international level for the abolition of fossil fuel subsidies in order to create a level playing field for all forms of energy and to support progress towards decarbonisation.  
 
Support for other countries 
• Within the Africa Renewable Energy Initiative (AREI), the German Government supports the goal of delivering 10 GW of new and additional renewable energy generation capacity in Africa by 2020, which will provide much broader access to sustainable, renewable energy. The German Government remains committed to its goal of helping partner countries to give another 100 million people access to sustainable energy by 2030. Around 12 million people gained access to sustainable energy from 2012 to 2015.  
• The German Government also supports efforts to combat energy poverty in LDCs in Africa through multilateral initiatives such as AREI, Energising Development (EnDev) and the Renewable Energy Cooperation Programme (RECP). 
• The German Government maintains numerous bilateral energy partnerships with strategically important countries in order to support the global transition to a secure, affordable and environmentally sound energy supply. These partnerships facilitate the exchange of experience and best practice and put in place reliable frameworks for renewables expansion and improvements in energy efficiency.  
• The primary goal of the energy partnerships is to support the expansion of renewables and promote efficient energy technologies. Within these partnerships, the German Government promotes the development of infrastructure and modern energy systems through technical and financial cooperation. Energy is the German Government’s largest funding area, amounting to around 3 billion euros in 2014.  
• The International Climate Initiative (IKI) has been assisting developing countries and emerging economies to expand their use of renewables since 2008; to date, support has been provided for around 75 projects with a total funding volume in excess of 285 million euros. 
 
The present draft of Germany’s National Sustainable Development Strategy 2016 envisages that national sustainability indicators and goals/measures concentrate on: (a) energy productivity and primary energy consumption; (b) the renewables share in final energy consumption, and the RES share in electricity consumption. 
 
 
SDG 8: Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all 
The purpose of SDG 8 is to achieve a transition towards more sustainable patterns of production and consumption. This is essentially a matter of reconciling economic performance with environmental protection, climate change mitigation, natural resource conservation and social equity, at both national and international level, while also ensuring and creating decent and good work by inter alia realising the right to work and implementing the ILO core labour standards. 
 
National challenges 
Sustainable, internationally competitive, environmentally sound and socially equitable economic growth is a foundation of prosperity in Germany: it ensures rising income from employment and more secure jobs, and can broaden the public sector’s scope for action. Germany shapes its economic and financial policy so as to make growth more sustainable. To that end, Germany has set itself the goal of becoming one of the most efficient and environmentally sound economies in the world. In pursuit of that goal, the absolute levels of resource and energy consumption throughout the value chain are to be reduced and decoupled from economic growth while efficiency is to be increased continuously. Moreover, the Federal Government is considering how new metrics of progress towards sustainable development can be adopted to supplement the metric of gross domestic product. Good and decent work in Germany and worldwide shall ensure that everyone can lead a self-determined and secure life on the basis of their employment. The German Government’s key aims include: full employment, good work for all groups in the labour market, equal pay for work of equal value, well functioning transitions from schools to occupations and high workplace protection standards. 
 
The following measures in particular serve to implement SDG 8 at national level: 
• Germany’s Resource Efficiency Programme II and its National Programme for Sustainable Consumption (both adopted in 2016), the Waste Prevention Programme and further steps taken towards a circular economy.  
• To implement and refine the German Government’s Green Economy Research Agenda, an implementation platform has been launched to facilitate an ongoing process of stimulation, development and roll-out of innovation for socially, environmentally and economically sustainable patterns of production and consumption. 
• The German Government is committed to implementing the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and is currently formulating a National Action Plan (NAP) on Business and Human Rights. 
• The German Government uses the Enterprises and Biological Diversity 2020 platform to engage in constructive dialogue with private-sector and nature-conservation associations on measures to implement the National Biodiversity Strategy where it pertains to the private sector. 
• Plattform Industrie 4.0 – bringing together policymakers, the private sector, academia and labour unions – will formulate recommendations for action to make Germany’s industry fit for the 4th Industrial Revolution. 
• The German Government pursues a comprehensive approach towards boosting public and private investment. It will continue to amplify investment dynamics and will adopt additional measures within the context of its investment strategy. 
• The German Government will continue to enhance Germany’s standing as an internationally competitive location for venture-capital financing, as announced in the key issues paper on promoting venture capital. 
• Within the context of the Alliance for Vocational and Further Training 2015–2018, the German Government is cooperating with the private sector, labour unions, federal states’ governments and the Federal Employment Agency with the aim of showing each young person interested in pursuing training a ‘path’ that can lead him or her to a vocational qualification as soon as possible. 
• In order to make better use of the skilled-labour potential of severely handicapped persons, the initiatives launched in connection with the National Action Plan to implement the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities will now be taken forward. 
• The universal minimum wage, the Act on Equal Participation of Men and Women in Executive Positions and the planned act to implement the principle of equal pay for equal or equivalent work aim to foster the principle of equal pay.  
• Various approaches are aiming to improve the reconciliation of work, care and family life and ensure that gaps in people’s work histories are narrowed. These approaches include: Exemptions granted under the Home Care Leave Act (Pflegezeitgesetz) or the Family Care Leave Act (Familienpflegezeitgesetz); support to employees during leave period through interest-free loans; care support allowance as wage compensation for temporary loss of working capacity (up to ten working days); the Elterngeld and Elterngeld Plus paren-
tal benefits schemes (which enable parents of young children to work part time and share the responsibility of looking after their children); increase in relief for single-parent families; and the nationwide KitaPlus daycare programme. Furthermore, the envisaged amendment to the law on part-time employment to include a statutory entitlement to fixed-term parttime working opportunities aims to improve the equality of opportunities for men and women in the workplace.  
• Also, the draft legislation for amending the German Law on Temporary Employment and other laws serve the prevention of abusive contracts for work, the further development of temporary employment and the strengthening of decent work. 
• Research and pilot projects for sustainable tourism promote environmentally sound and socially equitable tourism in Germany and abroad. 
• The New Quality of Work Initiative brings together the federal government, federal states’ governments, industry federations, labour unions, the Federal Employment Agency, individual companies, social security agencies and non-profit foundations. These stakeholders are engaging in a broad discourse across society in search of answers to the question of how work can be shaped such that it is profitable for companies while also being healthy, motivating and attractive for employees. 
 
Global responsibility 
• To eliminate child labour, it is essential first and foremost to ensure that their parents participate in the labour force and receive fair pay. Germany works towards that goal, notably within the International Labour Organization (ILO) framework with its Decent Work Agenda. Germany also supports the ILO’s International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC) and its programmes on social protection (Social Protection Floor), on the promotion of youth employment and on the promotion of labour standards in global supply chains. 
• To combat human trafficking for forced labour, Germany has set up a working group involving the federal and federal states’ governments and all relevant governmental and non-governmental institutions and stakeholders. The group is to devise a strategy and effective structures for combatting this form of human trafficking. 
• During its German presidency, the G7 adopted in 2015 a Declaration on Action for Fair Production designed to improve the enforcement of labour, social and environmental standards. 
• The German Government takes account of the G7 commitment to promote multistakeholder networks for sustainable supply chains, for instance by supporting various initiatives such as the Partnership for Sustainable Textiles and the German Initiative on Sustainable Cocoa. 
• Based on existing UN frameworks, the German Government is also taking steps to establish the issue of sustainability in global supply chains more firmly on the global agenda, 
e.g. at EU level, in the OECD, in the ASEM process and during Germany’s G20 presidency in 2017.  
• The German Government urges high environmental and social standards and the fulfilment of human rights in EU free trade agreements and unilateral EU trade instruments (such as the Generalised Scheme of Preferences Plus). 
• Germany strives to improve resource efficiency worldwide. For instance, the G7 adopted its first decisions on resource efficiency during Germany’s presidency in 2015 and founded a G7 Alliance for Resource Efficiency. The German Government will promote such developments in other forums as well, such as the G20. 
• Germany promotes the diversification of value chains in the tourism sector to integrate new, local products and services of local cultures. 
 
Support for other countries 
• In relation to trade issues, Germany contributes approximately four billion euros per year to the establishment of productive capacities in developing countries within the context of the Aid for Trade Initiative. Germany also promotes the dismantling of tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade worldwide. 
• Germany promotes vocational training and the establishment of job placement systems in developing countries and facilitates access for disadvantaged groups, especially women, young people and disabled persons. Equal pay for work of equal value is the goal of these efforts. 
• In more than 30 countries around the world, Germany promotes inclusive and sustainable growth and the development of low-carbon, environmentally sound and resource-efficient patterns of production and consumption and sustainable resource policy. 
 
The present draft of Germany’s National Sustainable Development Strategy 2016 envisages that national sustainability indicators and goals/measures concentrate on: (a) overall resource productivity; (b) government deficit, structural deficit; (c) government debt; (d) ratio of gross fixed capital formation to GDF; (e) GDP per capita; (f) employment rate; (g) proportion of Germany’s textile and apparel market for which the members of the Partnership for Sustainable Textiles can provide evidence of compliance with the Partnership’s social and environmental standards throughout their supply chains, underpinned by reporting. 
As concerns the alignment of financial policy and the design of the individual measures to assure sustainability, the German Government refers to the update to the German Stability Programme 2016. 
 
 
SDG 9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialisation and foster innovation 
The three components of SDG 9 – infrastructure, industrialisation and innovation – are closely linked. It is vital that they are designed in a sustainable manner so that other SDGs –  such as sustainable agriculture (SDG 2), sustainable economic growth (SDG 8), sustainable cities (SDG 11) and sustainable consumption and production patterns (SDG 12) – can be attained. To build resilient infrastructure, it is essential that, both at national and international level, the requirements of human health, noise protection, air pollution control, climate change mitigation and adaptation, and natural resource conservation are taken into account early on in the infrastructure planning process. Further aspects must also be considered, such as the equal participation of all in social and economic life. Moreover, it is essential to foster innovation, enhance scientific research, build technological capacity and steadily expand public and private spending. 
 
National challenges  
Sustainable consumption and production is an ongoing challenge which industry will have to continue to tackle in the coming years; at the same time, it offers great opportunities. By means of structural and industrial policy measures, Germany aims to create an environment for companies that fosters dynamic and sustainable economic development. The following measures serve this purpose: 
• The Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan (Bundesverkehrswegeplan, BVWP) 2030 defines the investments in the federal road, rail and waterway networks which the German Government wishes to realise by 2030. Maintenance has priority over expansion and new construction. The BVWP 2030 and the associated environmental report are currently the subject of a public participation procedure, the purpose of which is to conduct a substantive review of the fundamental determinations made in the Plan’s draft, particularly with regard to the environmental impacts resulting from the overall plan. 
• Moreover, the German Government promotes infrastructure for local public transport systems and cycling. 
• The broadband strategy envisages providing all households in Germany with at least 50 MBit/s broadband Internet by 2018. 
• The German Government’s High-Tech Strategy aims to strengthen Germany’s position in global competition, combine resources more effectively and generate fresh impetus for innovation in industry and society. 
• The Research for Sustainable Development framework programme (Forschung für Nachhaltige Entwicklung, FONA³) will create the decision-making basis for forward-looking action and will deliver innovative solutions for a sustainable society. The German Government has pledged 2 billion euros for FONA³ to 2020. 
• With its BioEconomy Policy Strategy, the German Government will foster the transition to a more resource-efficient economy. The National Research Strategy BioEconomy 2030 will further serve to mainstream such a transition in industry. 
• The Climate Action Programme 2020 facilitates environmentally sound and resourceconserving mobility by promoting clean modes of transport and developing network and control technologies. Furthermore, Germany will set up a national action plan for green innovation. 
 
Global responsibility 
At global level, Germany promotes sustainable infrastructure investment in its capacity as shareholder of multilateral development banks, in international forums such as the G7 and G20, and through its own financing schemes. In public and private infrastructure investments alike, Germany’s policies seek to ensure quality and sustainability. Germany’s commitment within the G7 context includes cooperation with emerging economies and developing countries to improve resource efficiency. 
 
Support for other countries 
• In emerging economies and developing countries, Germany promotes the sustainable development of local and regional industries, the transfer of knowledge and technology, and investment in infrastructure. Assistance will concentrate even more strongly in future on the SDGs, especially on the key aspects of sustainability and quality stated in Target 9.2. 
• With regard to the rising share of transport in greenhouse gas and other pollutant emissions, more resources will be devoted to building capacity, promoting investment and delivering sustainable mobility services. The International Climate Initiative will be one of the channels used to deploy such resources. 
• Germany fosters processes that lead to poverty-reducing industrial development and sustainable economic growth through the establishment of local and regional industries (pro-poor growth).  
 
The present draft of Germany’s National Sustainable Development Strategy 2016 envisages that national sustainability indicators and goals/measures concentrate on: Private and public R&D spending. 
  
 	 
SDG 10: Reduce inequality within and among countries 
The successful integration of emerging economies into the world economy has lessened global income inequality. In Germany, the Gini coefficient for market incomes rose continually since the early 1990s. This trend has been reversing since 2005, which means that inequality is decreasing. After taxes and transfers, inequality in Germany is lower than the OECD average. 
In some OECD countries, however, wealth and income inequality is at its highest level since 1945. In the OECD countries, the richest 10% of the population own around half of total net assets (in Germany, the figure is even higher at 60%, according to the OECD), and around 80% of the population owns just one third (Germany: one quarter) of total net assets. Wealth and income justice, equality and opportunities for participation for everyone are key prerequisites for unlocking every person’s economic, social and educational potential.  
Policy measures that improve opportunities for economic and social participation, especially for low-wealth, low-income groups, are therefore essential.  
 
National challenges 
According to OECD figures, Germany is among the countries in which government redistribution through taxes and social transfers has reduced income inequality to the greatest extent, lowering the poverty risk by 74%. In the past decade, income distribution in Germany has remained almost unchanged. Nonetheless, a challenge facing Germany is to further strengthen opportunities for participation for all social groups. With that aim in mind, Germany has initiated the following measures:  
• It is improving educational equality by creating more opportunities for access and participation for all children and young people across all education sectors (see SDG 4).  
• It has introduced a statutory minimum wage, shown to be an effective means of raising lower earners’ incomes.  
• With the draft legislation for amending the German Law on Temporary Employment and other laws, the German Government aims to prevent the misuse of work and services contracts and to further develop temporary employment. 
• A National Action Plan to implement the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities takes into account the findings of the NAP evaluation and the recommendations made by the relevant UN committee (CRPD). 
 
Global responsibility 
• Global trade can help to narrow inequalities. The German Government therefore advocates for pro-active trade policies which lower tariffs and non-tariff barriers to trade. Nondiscriminatory trade policy instruments which are conducive to development are important, as are the mainstreaming of high environmental, labour, social and human rights standards in free trade agreements, trade policy transparency, and the participation of civil society stakeholders (and vulnerable groups in particular) in their development. The German Government is in favour of impact assessments – human rights, economic, social and environmental – being carried out early on in the context of free trade agreements; it also supports timely monitoring. 
• The involvement of all social groups is important for achieving goals. The German Government therefore supports the development of multi-stakeholder initiatives, such as the Partnership for Sustainable Textiles and the German Initiative on Sustainable Cocoa, and introduces this topic into international processes (e.g. G7 summits). 
• In the current negotiations on the reform of the World Bank’s weighted voting system, Germany advocates for fairer distribution, shifting voting power from the industrialised countries to emerging and developing economies with the aim of narrowing inequalities. The German Government also advocates for the mainstreaming of high environmental and social standards in the multilateral development banks, such as the new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and – with a particular focus on improving civil society participation – in the review and update of the World Bank Safeguard Policies. 
 
Support for other countries 
Among other things, Germany assists its partners to promote pro-poor growth and progressive fiscal policies and establish social security systems in order to reduce income and wealth inequality.  
 
The present draft of Germany’s National Sustainable Development Strategy 2016 envisages that national sustainability indicators and goals/measures concentrate on: (a) young non-Germans with school-leaving qualifications; (b) a proposal to be discussed could deal with the Gini coefficients for income and wealth distribution.  
  
SDG 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable 
SDG 11 underscores the value of long-term and sustainable urban development policies, recognising the major significance of the growing trend towards urbanisation. Sustainable, integrated and inclusive urban development policies that simultaneously address social, economic and environmental goals and encourage joined-up thinking across sectors are essential. The main challenges currently facing integrated urban development are: promoting social inclusion; redesigning urban buildings, districts and technical infrastructures to make them resourceefficient, environmentally friendly and accessible; and maintaining cities as attractive spaces, with due regard for demographic change. Sustainable urban-rural relations are also important, particularly in the context of urban food security.  
 
National challenges 
The social dimension – such as safeguarding access to affordable housing, to affordable public transport and to public and green spaces, maintaining and restoring a social mix in urban districts and avoiding segregation and ghettoisation, and ensuring residents’ safety – is especially relevant in Germany at present. Reducing pollution in cities is an important goal, mainly in order to protect urban residents’ health. In addition, Germany’s decentralised settlement patterns create particular challenges in terms of sustainable land use. 
In response to these challenges, Germany is taking the following action:  
• The current successful cooperation among the federal, federal state and municipal governments and local authority associations is continuing and expanding within the framework of Germany’s National Urban Development Policy. The aim is to mainstream integrated urban development across sectors in order to address the economic, environmental and social challenges facing cities and municipalities.  
• In order to implement the SDGs at local/municipal level, the State Secretaries’ Committee for Sustainable Development has set up an Inter-Ministerial Working Group on Sustainable Urban Development, which approaches urban issues from a national and international perspective and initiates, coordinates and supports a whole-of-government approach.  
• The findings of research can make a significant contribution to sustainable urban development. Key challenges are identified in the Strategic Research Agenda, which is implemented by the National Platform for the City of the Future.  
• Cities’ engagement for innovative and effective climate protection at the local level is supported by Germany’s National Climate Initiative (NKI). 
• Accessibility must be safeguarded in the construction, redesigning and expansion of the federally owned public building stock.  
 
Global responsibility 
With a representative in the 10-member Bureau of the Preparatory Committee, Germany is actively involved in the preparatory process towards the Habitat III Conference, which aims to agree a New Urban Agenda for the global level for the next two decades. 
 
Support for other countries 
• A large number of Germany’s programmes of cooperation with other countries support sustainable urban development, with a particular focus on building the capacities of municipal and national governments and promoting good local governance and citizen participation. Germany helps to build urban infrastructures by supporting integrated resource-efficient housing construction and energy systems and the expansion of sustainable systems for urban mobility.  
• Within the framework of the International Climate Initiative (IKI) and Urbanisation Partnerships, Germany supports sustainable urban development in other countries through integrated approaches (e.g. Smart City concepts) that build cities’ capacities for independent climate policy engagement, enabling them to launch their own climate initiatives and make ambitious contributions. 
• Through its Research for Sustainable Development Framework Programme (FONA), Germany delivers the knowledge, decision-making tools and innovative solutions needed to create a sustainable urban society in developing countries and emerging economies. The resulting research networks form the international core of the Platform for the Future of the City (see above).  
 
The present draft of Germany’s National Sustainable Development Strategy 2016 envisages that national sustainability indicators and goals/measures concentrate on: (a) the increase in land covered by housing and transport infrastructure; (b) reducing final energy consumption in freight and passenger transport; (c) access to high-quality local public transport; (d) the burden of high housing costs.  
  
SDG 12: Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns 
SDG 12 aims to bring about the necessary changes in our lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production. Sustainable consumption and production means consuming and producing today in a manner which does not jeopardise fulfilment of the legitimate needs of present and future gen-
erations, with due regard for the limits to the Earth’s carrying capacity and for universal human rights. To that end, growth and prosperity must be decoupled from the consumption of national resources to a far greater extent than at present.  
 
National challenges 
Two out of three Germans believe that the environment can only be protected in the long term if everyone’s consumption is resource-efficient. There is, however, a discrepancy between many consumers’ real-world behaviour and their environmental awareness. At present, German consumer behaviour does not take the Earth’s carrying capacity into account to an adequate degree and requires critical discourse. It must also become easier for consumers to opt for more sustainable products.  
The state is acting as a model of best practice; the 2016 amendment to public procurement law was an important step in this direction. The supply and demand sides carry equal responsibility. In order that competition in the marketplace for consumers’ favour on the one hand, and demand for the cheapest possible products on the other, do not result in a race to the bottom for workplace and environmental quality, environmental and social standards must be observed at the production and distribution stages and during product recovery and disposal. 
Sustainable production focuses, all along the value chain, on more efficient natural resource use, the preservation of an intact environment and natural assets, respect for human rights and social and labour standards, and fair trade. Sustainable products should, as far as possible, be long-lasting, resource-efficient and recyclable at the end of their useful life.  
The following programmes and measures contribute to the implementation of SDG 12 at national level:  
• The National Programme for Sustainable Consumption of 2016, implemented through practical measures and mechanisms such as social debate, education, consumer information, sustainable public procurement and research. The Programme identifies six main fields of action: mobility, food, housing and residential, work and office, clothing, leisure and tourism. 
• The German Resource Efficiency Programme (ProgRess) (updated in 2016), whose implementation and expansion are intended to increase resource efficiency all along the value chain. 
• The German Government’s Waste Prevention Programme and the expansion of the circular economy will be accompanied by measures to promote a stronger focus on aspects such as lifespan, reparability and recyclability in product design. 
• Measures to avoid and reduce food waste and loss, especially by consolidating and refining the ‘Too Good for the Bin’ initiative. 
• More information and support for companies (especially SMEs) with the implementation of the EU Directive on sustainability reporting. 
• Implementation of the Consumer Behaviour and Biological Diversity Initiative. 
• Implementation of the Strategy For The Future Of Organic Farming; continuation and development of the Federal Organic Farming Scheme and other forms of sustainable agriculture (BÖLN), agri-environmental measures, climate action, animal welfare programmes and the Protein Crop Strategy.  
• Implementation of the National Policy Strategy on Bioeconomy. 
• Accompanying research, e.g. on ways to promote the shift towards sustainable lifestyles and business models, sustainability assessments, and a framework for a green economy. 
• Implementation and expansion of the Maßnahmenprogramm Nachhaltigkeit, a sustainability package for public procurement by the federal authorities; federally owned properties are to be brought into closer alignment with the Assessment System for Sustainable Building (BNB); support for public procurement managers in applying the new procurement regulations for more mainstreaming of sustainability (Centre of Excellence for Sustainable Procurement, Kompass Nachhaltigkeit); use of scope afforded by the revised public procurement legislation to promote sustainability in this sector. 
 
Global responsibility 
• Industrialised countries have a key role to play in promoting sustainable consumption and production patterns and increasing resource efficiency worldwide. Due to their economies’ integration into global value and supply chains, they exert considerable influence on production methods in other countries. This in turn gives rise to a special responsibility for the resulting economic, environmental and social impacts. Germany will implement the G7 decisions on sustainable supply chains and resource efficiency and advocate for a stronger focus on these issues in other international processes, such as the G20.  
• Promoting sustainable consumption through more transparency and consumer information (e.g. www.siegelklarheit.de): this aims to raise awareness of sustainability labels and expand credible labelling schemes based on environmental and social standards (with an initial focus on the market share of products which have been awarded governmentsponsored eco-labels, e.g. the Blue Angel).  
• Continued expansion and implementation of global partnerships with businesses, trade unions, governments and civil society on promoting sustainable supply chains (e.g. Partnership for Sustainable Textiles, German Initiative on Sustainable Cocoa, Forum for Sustainable Palm Oil).  
• Germany will also continue its active support for the 10 Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production (10 YFP), UNEP’s International Resource Panel and the Partnership for Action on Green Economy (PAGE).  
• Germany advocates for better resource governance, e.g. via German reporting within the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI)12 framework. It is also working towards the rapid adoption and implementation of a draft EU regulation on curbing conflict financing from extractive resources, which is passing through the legislative process at present, and the G7 CONNEX initiative, which provides advice for resource-rich developing countries engaged in complex contract negotiations in the extractive sector. 
 
Support for other countries 
• Germany helps other countries to implement international environmental and social standards, supports their transformation towards an inclusive green economy and promotes pro-poor business models and environmental and climate-oriented investment; these forms of support are delivered through the International Climate Initiative (IKI) and German development cooperation. Integrated strategies for the water/energy/food security nexus are also promoted in partner countries.  
• Support is also provided for technology and knowledge transfer to emerging economies and developing countries, with a focus on sustainable consumption and production patterns and the development of a pro-poor, low-carbon, resource-efficient, green economy.  
 
The present draft of Germany’s National Sustainable Development Strategy 2016 envisages that national sustainability indicators and goals/measures concentrate on: (a) market share of products and services which have been awarded credible quality labels which meet high social and environmental standards (first step: market share of products which have been awarded government-sponsored eco-labels); (b) energy consumption/CO2 emissions resulting from private households’ consumption; (c) environmental management (EMAS). 
 
 
SDG 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts  
SDG 13 focuses on one of the most important planetary boundaries, which must be respected if humankind is to survive in its present form. Protecting the global climate is one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century. Swift and ambitious action to reduce climate-damaging emissions (i.e. mitigation) and support adaptation to the impacts of climate change is vital for global sustainable development.  
 
National challenges 
In accordance with the goal set out in the Paris Agreement of achieving global greenhouse gas neutrality in the second half of the century in order to hold the increase in the global average temperature below 2 °C while also pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C, and to boost capacity to adapt to climate change and make financial flows compatible with climate-smart development, Germany advocates for the transformation of economies towards more sustainability with the goal of achieving greenhouse gas neutrality in the second half of the century.  
• The German Government is committed to a minimum 40% cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, 55% by 2030, 70% by 2040 and 80-95% by 2050, compared to 1990 levels.13 
• In order to enable Germany to meet its climate target for 2020, the German Government adopted a Climate Action Programme 2020, including a National Action Plan on Energy Efficiency, in late 2014. The document lists around 100 measures in all GHG-relevant sectors (energy; buildings; transport; industry; commerce/trade/services; circular economy and waste management; agriculture). A national climate action alliance, comprising representatives from all groups of society, supports the implementation of the Action Programme. In order to monitor implementation, an annual climate action report is produced. 
• The next specific reduction steps will be defined with reference to the European targets and the outcome of the 2015 Paris Climate Change Conference, based on the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80-95% by 2050 compared with 1990 levels, and will be supported with measures developed in a broad-based dialogue process (Climate Action Plan 2050). 
• In the German Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change (Deutsche Anpassungsstrategie, DAS), the German Government has spelled out the risks posed by climate change, stated the needs for action, defined appropriate objectives and developed potential adaptation measures with the aim of reducing the vulnerability of natural, social and economic systems and maintaining and improving their adaptive capacity. The first Progress Report on the German Adaptation Strategy (December 2015) lists around 140 actions by the German Government in various policy areas, including transport, construction, coastal protection, health, research and international cooperation. A Monitoring Report describing the already discernible impacts of climate change with reference to more than 100 indicators and presenting further vulnerability analyses and future priorities for German adaptation policy will be presented every four years. The next Progress Report will be published in 2020.  
• The National Climate Initiative (NKI), which supports broad-based climate actions in Germany, and the DAS funding programme for adaptation projects will be continued.  
• The German Government’s Third Research for Sustainable Development Framework Programme (FONA3) improves the knowledge base and decision-making tools for climate change mitigation and adaptation.  
 
Global responsibility 
The German Government is a staunch advocate for ambitious international climate policies and appropriate mitigation targets within the EU, G7 and G20 frameworks, in the UNFCCC process, and in informal forums, its aim being to accelerate the necessary transformation towards decarbonisation of the world economy. This includes the following:  
• Germany is to double its contribution to international climate finance by 2020, compared with 2014 levels.  
• By making use of instruments aimed at leveraging funds on the capital market and mobilising private investment, Germany will make an appropriate contribution to the USD 100 billion target for 2020.  
• Germany supports climate change research and the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). 
• With the Petersberg Climate Dialogue moving in the right direction, Germany is supporting international exchange and cooperation on implementing the Paris Agreement.  
• During the German G7 Presidency in 2014/2015, Germany and the G7 established the Carbon Market Platform for strategic dialogue on carbon market-based and regulatory instruments, aimed at facilitating a worldwide low-carbon development path. Germany is engaged in other international initiatives to promote carbon pricing worldwide, including the Partnership for Market Readiness, the International Carbon Action Partnership (ICAP) and the Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition. 
 
Support for other countries 
• Germany is one of the largest donors to international climate action. Bilateral and multilateral programmes and funds available in the context of international cooperation are used to implement climate change mitigation and adaptation projects and protect forest and biological diversity, primarily in the following areas:  
• Sustainable energy through the expansion of renewables; forest conservation to curb deforestation and promote reforestation.  
• Expansion of low-emission and climate-adapted food production.  
• Building adaptive capacities and resilience to the impacts of climate change. 
• Dissemination of climate insurance schemes. 
• Utilising the International Climate Initiative, among other avenues, Germany assists developing countries and emerging economies to contribute to climate change mitigation. This is done by boosting capacity, identifying priority measures in national planning processes and providing climate finance. 
 
The present draft of Germany’s National Sustainable Development Strategy 2016 envisages that national sustainability indicators and goals/measures concentrate on: (a) greenhouse gas emissions; (b) international climate financing for mitigation and adaptation. 
  
SDG 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development  
Healthy, productive marine and coastal ecosystems are of great importance for global food security, sustainable economic development and adaptation by coastal inhabitants to the impacts of climate change. Given that the oceans’ fundamental functional capacity constitutes a planetary boundary that must not be exceeded, effective marine protection is indispensable. 
 
National challenges 
Germany aims to maintain and, where necessary, achieve a good ecological status of its marine waters in the North and Baltic Seas. The challenge is to protect marine ecosystems while at the same time safeguarding the potential for their sustainable use. This is true, in particular, for our ‘domestic seas’, i.e. the North Sea with its Wadden Sea, which is of special ecological importance, and the Baltic Sea with its sensitive shallow bays (Bodden).  
It is therefore Germany’s ambition to achieve the following: 
• Nutrient inputs into watercourses and marine waters from agricultural fertiliser applications are to be reduced following the current amendment of the Federal Fertiliser Ordinance. Additionally, an assessment must be made as to whether this will achieve the objectives of the EU legislation in force (Water Framework Directive, Marine Strategy Framework Directive). Where necessary, the federal states must take further-reaching measures to reduce nutrient inputs into watercourses, including inputs from sources other than agricultural sources.  
• Agri-environmental measures and climate measures as well as support for organic farming – on a net total area of more than 4 million hectares – also contribute to reducing nutrient inputs into the seas.  
• In the exclusive economic zone, the Federal Government is currently preparing to designate as nature reserves 8 protected areas designated under the Habitats Directive. These will supplement the existing terrestrial and coastal protected areas already designated by the federal states. The Federal Government will advocate for the introduction of EUlevel fisheries restrictions required to achieve the conservation objectives set for these protected areas. Proposals have already been tabled for the sites in the North Sea; these will now need to be coordinated and agreed with the EU Member States whose fisheries will be affected.  
• In future the Federal Government will more strongly seek to ensure that the framework plans under the Joint Task for the Improvement of Agricultural Structures and Coastal Protection (GAK) are consistent with sustainable coastal development.  
• With the implementation of the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive, an EUwide good environmental status of the marine waters is to be achieved by 2020. To this end, national programmes of measures based on an ecosystem-based approach are to be developed that contain an integrated, cross-sectoral protection strategy, allowing for the sustainable use of seas today and by future generations.  
• The Federal Government will assess whether the 2006 Integrated Coastal Zone Management Strategy must be further developed in the context of implementing the Marine Strategy Framework Directive.  
 
Global responsibility 
• At regional and EU levels and as a G7 member, Germany is committed to combating marine litter. Germany is closely involved with this issue in the context of the OSPAR and HELCOM marine protection conventions (Regional Action Plans on Marine Litter). Under the 
German G7 presidency in 2015, the G7 has adopted its own Action Plan to Combat Marine 
Litter. 
• With support from the Partnership on Regional Ocean Governance (PROG) initiated in 2015 by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the Potsdam Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS) and the Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations (IDDRI), Germany contributes to eliminating structural barriers to integrated management of marine resources. 
• In the contexts of both the EU and the UN, Germany promotes the negotiation of an Agreement for the Implementation of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea with a view to laying the foundations for effective marine protection in waters beyond national jurisdiction – on the high seas – i.a. by designating globally recognised marine protected areas. 
• The Federal Government supports the establishment of Arctic and Antarctic protected areas and will submit a complete proposal for the Antarctic Weddell Sea to the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) in 2016. Additionally, the Federal Government supports the designation of an Arctic High Seas Protected Area under the OSPAR Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the NorthEast Atlantic. 
• In the context of the EU Common Fisheries Policy, the Federal Government promotes efforts to ensure that by 2020 at the latest all fish stocks are fished in such a manner that their populations are kept at levels higher than required for achieving Maximum Sustainable Yields, that adverse impacts of fisheries on the marine ecosystem are minimised, and that discards are phased out by avoiding and reducing, as far as possible, unwanted catches, and by progressively implementing a landing obligation.  
 
Support for other countries 
• The Federal Government contributes to achieving protective designations for additional coastal and marine areas in developing countries and emerging economies, and to ensuring that these areas are managed effectively and sustainably, with secure funding. To this end, Germany supports measures for the conservation, protection, regeneration and sustainable use of coastal ecosystems as well as measures designed to eliminate the root causes of marine pollution and it will strengthen its commitment in this area. 
• The Federal Government also supports sustainable fisheries in developing countries and emerging economies and is committed to safeguarding in the long-term the livelihoods of people living in coastal regions in these countries. Germany supports partner countries in combating illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. 
 
The present draft of Germany’s National Sustainable Development Strategy 2016 envisages that national sustainability indicators and goals/measures concentrate on: (a) nutrient inputs into coastal and marine waters; (b) proportion of sustainably managed fish stocks to total fish stocks in the North and Baltic Seas. 
  
SDG 15: Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss 
Intact ecosystems are an indispensable basis of human existence and sustainable development. They are the basis for ensuring a varied diet 
and provide clean air, clean drinking water and important raw materials. Ecosystems buffer against temperature fluctuations and contribute to climate mitigation by sequestering carbon. Intact ecosystems hosting a natural diversity of species protect against environmental disasters such as flooding or landslides and they have a greater capacity to adapt to climate change. Goods and services provided by nature are both the foundation on which many economic sectors are built as well as their capital. 
 
National challenges 
Germany is an industrialised country with a high population density (approximately 229 inhabitants/ km2).14 More than half of Germany’s national territory is under agricultural land use; one third is covered by forests. Germany has made progress in reconciling protection and utilisation. However, the loss of habitats and species has not been halted. The following measures, among others, are taken to address these issues: 
• The German National Strategy on Biological Diversity sets out around 330 targets and 430 concrete measures to be taken in sixteen fields of action. One of these targets is that by 2020, forests with natural forest development will account for 5% of the wooded area. Other strategies, e.g. the Forest Strategy 2020 and the National Strategy for Agrobiodiversity also contribute to protecting biodiversity. 
• The number of nature reserves and national parks is growing continuously. Currently they cover approximately 4.3% of Germany’s land area. Roughly 15.5% of the country’s terrestrial area is designated as Natura 2000 sites under the EU Habitats and Birds Directives.17 
• National Natural Heritage Sites – i.e. nationally representative nature conservation areas owned by the German state – are excluded from privatisation and are transferred, free of charge, to the federal states, conservation trusts or conservation NGOs. In this manner, the preconditions for safeguarding important ecosystems have been met on a total of 156,000 hectares of federal lands.  
• The Forest Strategy 2020 aims at achieving a sustainable balance between the diverse and increasing demands made on forests and the forests’ functional capacities. In implementing the Forest Strategy, greater emphasis is given to the protection objectives of the National Strategy on Biological Diversity. Suitable measures are taken to include small and micro private forests in these developments.  
• The sustainable utilisation of soils as a resource is an important national objective. In accordance with the Federal Government’s 2015 Environmental Report, soil-related issues are to be given further increasing consideration, e.g. by reflecting the soil-related provisions of the 2030 Agenda in the National Sustainable Development Strategy. 
• The aim of the Bundesprogramm Blaues Band (Federal Blue Ribbon Programme) is to make available for the restoration of rivers and alluvial plains a 2800 km long subnet of waterways that is no longer required for transporting goods. Moreover, this will also involve new approaches to flood prevention, nature conservation and recreation. 
• With its Research for Sustainable Development (FONA3) framework programme, the Federal Government improves knowledge and decision-making tools for maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem services. The programme’s focal topics are ‘Ecological and socioeconomic dynamics’, ‘Long-term data and data management’, ‘Natural capital’ and ‘Land degradation’.  
• Since 2012, the Federal Government has been supporting the ‘Natural Capital Germany - TEEB DE’ study with a view to furthering an understanding of the value of ecosystems and the services they provide and promoting their consideration in national and local plans and development processes in Germany. 
 
Global responsibility 
• In 2013, the Federal Government established a Forest Climate Fund as part of its Energy and Climate Fund (EKF) special assets. The Forest Climate Fund supports measures aimed at maintaining and increasing the CO2 reduction potential of forests and timber, and at forest adaptation to climate change. 
• Since 2013, Germany has been providing more than 500 million euros per annum for the conservation of forests and other ecosystems worldwide. This represents a more than four-fold increase in its commitments since 2007 and includes bilateral commitments as well as multilateral payments as part of the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF). Germany seeks to increase, within its available budgetary resources, this funding in the coming years. 
• In September 2014, Germany committed to the implementation of the New York Declaration on Forests (2014) which calls for an end to the loss of natural forests by 2030 and for the restoration of more than 350 million hectares of forests and degraded landscapes worldwide. With its internationally renowned Bonn Challenge action platform, Germany supports the target to restore 150 million hectares of degraded and deforested land by 2020. The action platform also supports the African ‘AFR 100’ challenge, an effort to bring 100 million hectares of land in Africa into forest restoration by 2030. 
• With its signing of the Amsterdam Declaration in December 2015, Germany has also declared its aim to eliminate deforestation from agricultural commodity chains. 
• With a view to combating illegal logging, Germany established a Centre of Competence on the Origin of Timber as a central contact facility for government agencies, the timber trade, consumers and conservation associations and it initiated the Global Timber Tracking Network (GTTN) in order to promote tools to support or refute claims of timber provenance worldwide. 
• In 2015, the Economics of Land Degradation (ELD) Initiative, having received substantial support from Germany, presented its results on the economic value of soil and terrestrial ecosystems and the cost of ongoing land degradation.  
• Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) is the top priority in the development of solutions and approaches to the sustainable use of land as a resource at national and international levels. Two support measures currently address LDN.  
• By funding research on biodiversity and ecosystems, the Federal Government also supports the work of the IPBES (Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services). 
• Germany strongly supported the establishment of the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests as endorsed by the United Nations Committee on World Food Security (CFS) in October 2013. They represent the first global international agreement governing secure and fair access to natural resources and also address governance of land acquisition by investors, commonly referred to as land grabbing.  
• Efforts to combat wildlife crimes are among the focus areas of German environmental and development policy. The adoption of the first UN Resolution on Tackling the Illicit Trafficking in Wildlife at the UN General Assembly in 2015 is a milestone in the efforts to tackle the urgent problem of species protection. The resolution was primarily sponsored and negotiated by Gabon and Germany. 
• On April 21, 2016, Germany ratified the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization (Access and Benefit Sharing, ABS). Regulation (EU) No 511/2014 and accompanying national legal provisions bring German law in line with these international obligations. 
 
 	 
Support for other countries 
• Germany supports countries in Africa, Oceania and Latin America in their implementation of the Nagoya Protocol and the International Seed Treaty, in their valorisation of genetic resources and in the establishment of value chains that are compliant with current ABS rules and contribute to biodiversity conservation through benefit-sharing. 
• Since 2008, Germany has provided more than one billion euros under the REDD+ mechanism (Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation). Emissions reductions and the reduction of deforestation and forest degradation are also a focus of the German Government’s International Climate Initiative. Germany, Norway and the United Kingdom announced a collective aim to increase their annual REDD+ contribution to US$ 1 billion by 202018. 
• Germany also supports its partner countries in the establishment and sustainable management of nature reserves and provides ongoing financial support of more than 500 million euros for a total area greater than the territories of France and Germany combined. 
 
The present draft of Germany’s National Sustainable Development Strategy 2016 envisages that national sustainability indicators and goals/measures concentrate on: (a) species diversity and landscape quality; (b) ecosystem eutrophication; (c) payments to developing countries for proven conservation or restoration of forests under the REDD+ mechanism. 
  
SDG 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels 
SDG 16 is a key Goal of the Agenda. Good governance, peace and security are important objectives in their own right, as well as being a fundamental prerequisite for achieving other Sustainable Development Goals. The 2030 Agenda’s broad ambition to transform societies can only be achieved through improved governance and the realisation of civil and political rights; this is essential if communities are to effect, mainstream and safeguard social, economic and environmental change.  
 
National challenges 
• Equality and participation, especially the equal participation of women and girls in social development and political decision-making. To that end, the proportion of women in political leadership needs to be raised and the conditions for achieving a balance between work, 
																																																												
18	2015	Paris	Climate	Summit		
family and political life must be improved. In addition, accessibility and inclusion are essential to help people with disabilities lead a self-determined life and participate in society as provided for in the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  
• Protection of women, children and young people from (sexual) violence: prevention and interventions are required to protect these groups effectively from sexual violence and exploitation. Training for professionals working in this field and the adoption of protection strategies at centres dealing with these issues are key components. Germany’s Early Assistance for Parents and Children programme – a support scheme for parents-to-be and young families – is a further priority. Full implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, including the fundamental right to protection from abuse and neglect, is the guiding principle and target in this context.  
 
Global responsibility 
• Germany is working intensively at bilateral level, in multilateral forums and particularly within the United Nations for the promotion of good governance, the resolution of armed conflicts, crisis prevention, effective arms control, protection of and respect for human rights, and peace and security, recognising that these are indispensable bases for all forms of development. Germany emphatically supports appropriate UN reforms which facilitate progress towards these goals.  
• Re-elected as a member of the UN Human Rights Council for 2016-2018, Germany engages for the protection and promotion of human rights worldwide and will continue to make significant contributions to support and develop international and regional human rights mechanisms and institutions. Human rights are a guiding principle of German development policy. The German Government also works to protect the rights of persons with disabilities worldwide.  
• Germany attaches particular importance to the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security, including its follow-up resolutions, as a cross-cutting issue in foreign, security and development policy; this includes, in particular, actively engaging women in all phases of crisis prevention, conflict resolution and peacebuilding and protecting women and girls from rape and other forms of sexual abuse in situations of armed conflict. The German Government is also a firm advocate for the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1612 and its follow-up resolutions on the protection of children in armed conflict. 
• As a key policy issue for Germany, the German Government advocates for more intensive international cooperation on combating organised crime worldwide, for effective end-use control of German arms exports and for stringent criteria governing the granting of licences for ‘new for old’ small arms exports in order to prevent their proliferation. Germany actively supports the implementation of the Arms Trade Treaty and provides funding for numerous arms control projects in affected countries in order to combat arms trafficking and its negative impacts on the stability of entire regions. These projects can help to prevent conflicts and support the stabilisation of crisis countries. Germany takes effective measures to prevent and prosecute money laundering and terrorist financing and supports developing countries and emerging economies in these fields of action. 
 
Support for other countries 
• The German Government engages directly with fragile states and civil society within the framework of the International Dialogue on Peacebuilding and Statebuilding and aligns its cooperation with these countries to the peacebuilding and statebuilding goals defined in the New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States.  
• All of Germany’s development programmes in fragile states are conflict-sensitive, i.e. they aim to ‘do no harm’. Activities in fragile states are defined as a key priority of Germany’s development policy. Around one in three cooperation countries belongs to the group of fragile states. Approx. 25% of Germany’s ODA funding goes to measures in fragile states. Furthermore, Germany supports the establishment of African peace and security structures to strengthen regional capacities to prevent crises and manage conflicts, for example within the African Union. 
• Human rights are a guiding principle of German development policy. Promoting equality and non-discrimination, e.g. by strengthening the rights of marginalised and persecuted groups, is a priority for the German Government. Germany fosters good governance in partner countries in the fields of human rights, gender equality, democracy and political participation, freedom of expression and access to information, anti-corruption, the rule of law, administrative reform, decentralisation, good financial governance, and extractive industry transparency. In addition to improving governance performance and strengthening legal and institutional frameworks, it is essential to build civil society capacities in the interests of constructive state-society relations.  
 
The present draft of Germany’s National Sustainable Development Strategy 2016 envisages that national sustainability indicators and goals/measures concentrate on: (a) crime; (b) the number of projects focusing on the securing, registration and destruction of small arms and light weapons (SALW) being implemented by Germany in affected regions of the world. 
 
 
SDG 17: Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalise the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development 
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is underpinned by a global partnership that transcends the old donor-recipient mentality and assigns responsibilities to non-governmental stakeholders as well. The Agenda’s goals can only be achieved through such a global partnership – in mutual respect, with shared values and the combined efforts of all stakeholders. 
 
The German Federal Government considers the new global partnership to be pivotal:  
Key principles: 
• Universality of goals – all must act: The goals of the 2030 Agenda apply to developing, emerging and industrialised countries and to all policy realms. The diverse national circumstances, capabilities and development levels are taken into account, as are national policy approaches and priorities. 
• Shared responsibility – suitability of the contributions made by each individual. All states and stakeholders bear a shared responsibility for global wellbeing, notably for such global public goods which can only be maintained through joint action by the international community and for structural conditions conducive to development. This is reflected in contributions commensurable to each state or stakeholder. 
• Effectiveness, transparency and monitoring – mutual motivation. The international community needs information about the progress made in implementing the 2030 Agenda. The commitments made by states, the measures they have taken and the effectiveness of their actions are tracked and reported. The exchange of experience and mutual learning processes are intensified in order to foster developmental and transformational efforts. 
• Multi-stakeholder approach – all are part of the team. National governments alone will not be able to handle the challenges facing the international community. Successful implementation of the 2030 Agenda therefore requires new forms of cooperation, involving civil society, industry and academia at the local, national and global levels. 
The Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) has redefined the principles of global development financing. Such financing is an integral component of the 2030 Agenda and particularly relevant to SDG 17. While affirming the national-level ownership of development processes, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda underscores the key role of private and public national financial flows and the complementary role of development cooperation and South-South cooperation. 
 
The German Federal Government’s activities: 
1. Financing global sustainable development: In two packages for the period from 2014 to 2019, Germany has pledged a total of 10.3 billion euros in additional funding for development cooperation. Germany is thus moving ever closer to attaining the target of deploying 0.7% of Gross National Income for development cooperation. Promoting and harnessing the private sector for pro-development investments has long been an element of German development cooperation, as has the establishment of financial markets and systems. This involves creating incentives for private-sector investors, building and resourcing microfinance institutions, introducing insurance instruments, creating conducive settings for the promotion of sustainable economic growth, and fostering companies’ inclusive and green business models. The mobilisation of domestic revenue in developing countries is vital and is fostered by, among other things, the new Addis Tax Initiative (ATI). Germany will double its support for the mobilisation and effective use of developing countries’ own domestic revenue by 2020. Furthermore, to close tax loopholes, Germany has committed to implementing the G20/OECD Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) by multinational enterprises, has agreed a concrete roadmap and advocates for intensified cooperation with developing countries on these matters.  
2. The German Government participated constructively in recent years in the debate within United Nations forums on a state insolvency mechanism and advocates for the broader inclusion of contractual wording in government bond issues that permits rapid performance of debt restructuring should this become necessary. 
3. Trade policy: The German Government advocates for a fair and open world trading system in which trade liberalisation does justice to the requirements of developing countries. To enhance the coherence of agricultural, environmental, trade and development policy, the Federal Government continues to advocate for the dismantling of trade-distorting subsidies at the level of EU agricultural and trade policy and at the multilateral level, while at the same time creating sufficient political scope to pursue the SDGs effectively, especially in the fields of poverty reduction, food security, environmental protection and resource conservation. Germany further argues for a pro-development conclusion to the Doha Round, and when debating the new WTO issues will insist on the consideration of development and sustainability aspects as a concrete demand in WTO negotiations. 
Within the scope of the Aid for Trade (AfT) initiative, Germany provides targeted support for capacity-building with regard to trade and investment in developing countries and promotes the Global Alliance for Trade Facilitation, which seeks to mobilise and integrate the private sector for development goals. 
4. Technology: Germany promotes partnerships that enhance the transfer of environmentally sound and pro-development technologies and social and environmental innovations to developing countries. Germany supports the process to establish a technology facilitation mechanism and a technology bank for least developed countries. 
5. Germany addresses international structural issues in pursuit of the 2030 Agenda in international institutions such as the IMF and WTO and in the G20 and G7 groups of states. In its capacity as a member of the United Nations, member state of the EU and OECD and major shareholder of the World Bank and regional development banks, Germany supports reform and strategy processes within these organisations in order that they are able to make the best possible contributions to the 2030 Agenda within the scope of their respective mandates and comparative strengths. 
6. More policy coherence and partnerships: Germany’s updated National Sustainable Development Strategy contributes to further enhancing policy coherence for sustainable development within the Federal Government and requires efforts to implement the SDGs in all policy areas. With a view to the call to form partnerships, including within civil society, efforts to involve society in the formulation and implementation of the new National Sustainable Development Strategy will be stepped up. To that end, the Federal Government is launching initiatives such as the national platform for the 2030 Agenda partnerships, which will facilitate new forms of cooperation through a network that fosters the exchange of experience and knowledge among stakeholders in policy-making, civil society, academia and the private sector. 
7. New metrics of progress towards sustainable development: the work of the German Bundestag’s Study Commission on ‘Growth, Prosperity and Quality of Life’ and work on an indicator set to measure the quality of life as a part of the government strategy ‘Living well – Quality of life in Germany’ all contribute to developing metrics of progress that supplement the GDP metric. 
8. Dialogue processes with civil society: Dialogue processes such as the dialogue forum for the 2030 Agenda and the Charter for the Future ‘ONE WORLD – Our Responsibility’ (see above) help to communicate the goals of the 2030 Agenda to the broader public and make them a part of society’s narratives. 
 
The present draft of Germany’s National Sustainable Development Strategy 2016 envisages that national sustainability indicators and goals/measures concentrate on: (a) official development assistance (ODA) as a share of gross national income; (b) number of students and researchers from developing countries in MINT subjects; (c) German imports from low-income developing countries and least developed countries. 
  
5.  Next steps 
The draft of the new National Sustainable Development Strategy is currently open for comments by the public. Following consultations with non-governmental stakeholders and further state actors (parliament, federal states, local authorities) and any changes to the draft that may result, the revised strategy is to be adopted by the Federal Cabinet in autumn 2016. The next indicator report on the strategy is envisaged for 2018; the next progress report is to be published in 2020. 
For some of the issues that would merit the inclusion of a corresponding national goal in the National Sustainable Development Strategy, suitable indicators have yet to be defined. It is therefore envisaged that new indicators and goals leading up to 2030 be elaborated quickly for further areas pivotal to sustainability policy (covering, among other issues, avoidable food losses in Germany, consideration of sustainability criteria in public procurement with a focus on government agencies and facilities of the federal administration, education for sustainable development, soil protection).  
The inter-ministerial working group on sustainability indicators has been tasked with the assessment of an action-oriented indicator for land use. 
Following the periodic progress report on the National Sustainable Development Strategy due in 2020, the Federal Government intends to report to the HLPF again in 2021.
