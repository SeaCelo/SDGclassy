Executive Summary
Progress on the MDGs: Turkey has been successful in implementing almost all MDGs during the last 15 years. Comprehensive efforts to increase the level of achievement in all MDGs created a holistic development perspective among policy practitioners. Turkey is among the top ten performers as measured by average annual rates of relative progress, especially when goals such as eradicating extreme poverty, reducing child mortality, improving maternal health, ensuring environmental sustainability (in areas such as the improvement of accessibilty of drinking water and sanitation), are considered. Turkey has also indicated extensive advancement in the global partnership for improvement. As a direct result of these facts, transition to SDGs will be based on the lessons learnt in the MDG process of Turkey.
The Concept of Sustainable Development in Turkey’s Policy Environment: In Turkey, sustainable development policies are incorporated within numerous laws, legislations, regulations, policy documents and action plans in a variety of policy fields and sectors. Being defined as the highest-level national policy document in Turkey, Turkey’s National Development Plan (NDP) sets out all macro-level national policies and priorities. Turkey has first introduced the concept of sustainable development into 7th Development Plan in 1996 after 1992 Rio Conference. During the last decade, outcomes of Rio+20 have been harmonized with 10th Development Plan that covers 2014-2018.  One of the main principles of the 10th Development Plan is sustainable development and the Plan is based on a “human-centered development” approach. The content of the 10th Development Plan is placed in the context of sustainable development. A preliminary analysis indicates that there is a high consistency between the 10th Development Plan and the SDGs.
Integration of SDGs into the 11th National Development Plan: Turkey is currently in the stage of preparing long term vision of the 11th NDP. The vision provides the development perspective of the Plan by taking into account the international and national trends in development landscape and serves as the starting point for drafting the Plan itself. Turkey intends to take SDGs as one of the main inputs of the vision that 11th Development Plan will be based on.
Institutional Mechanisms to Implement SDGs: Ministry of Development (MoD), the Ministry responsible for the preparation of NDPs in Turkey, will follow a policy coherence approach at the center of the implementation process of SDGs. Given the coordination role of MoD and macro level place of NDPs at the top of policy-making process in Turkey, implementation of SDGs will be a responsibility shared by all stakeholders. In this respect, the integration of SDGs into all documents of relevant strategies and and policies at both central and local levels will be enabled in the best possible way. Turkey’s National Sustainable Development Commission (NSDC) will be strengthened and widened as a high-level technical setting, in line with its coordinating role and the comprehensive nature of the 2030 Agenda. The role and the structure of the Commission will be established according to the comprehensive and interconnected nature of the task lying in front of us. High level participation in the commission will be ensured for effective policy and decision making. The Commission will act as the main responsible body for the follow-up and review in the implementation process of SDGs.
Public Awareness and Ownership for SDGs: In the implementation phase of the Agenda, political ownership will be essential in order to achieve successful outcomes. Taking into account the comprehensive and universal nature of SDGs, political ownership at the highest possible level and effective coordination among all stakeholders will be a key factor for translating the global vision of the SDGs into national actions. 2030 Agenda assigns responsibility not only to governments but also to businesses, NGOs and academia. Turkey aims to guarantee a national setting that relies on the principles of participation, inclusiveness, accountability and transparency for the effective contribution of all relevant stakeholders. The Government of Turkey aims to prepare an agenda that will be embraced by all citizens.
SDG Indicators and How to Monitor Progress: In terms of how to proceed once the goals have been set, The Government of Turkey intends to develop a review framework that conforms with the UN framework on follow-up and review. National SDG Review Reports are expected to be prepared on a periodical basis in line with the HLPF agenda. Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat) will take the central role for the monitoring process of the Agenda, based on global SDG indicators. In addition, voluntary monitoring and reporting processes pioneered by the private sector will be encouraged. Since 2000, Turkey has already developed a national sustainable development indicator set, composed of 132 indicators under 10 categories. Turkey is going to further develop its current set by taking into account the results of UN Statistics work for global framework for common monitoring and the national priority lists of SDGs. TurkStat plans to initiate a study for analyzing the data gaps and further studies on building the capacity to monitor and fill those gaps.
Development Cooperation Setting of Turkey and Possible Partnerships for Future Collaboration: Turkey is an emerging donor in the field of development cooperation, and there has been a drammatical increase in the official development assistance (ODA) provided by the country in recent years. In 2014, Turkey’s net ODA amounted to USD 3.6 billion, representing an increase of 15% in real terms over the year 2013. The ratio of ODA as a share of GNI rose from 0.40% in 2013 to 0.45% in 2014. Preliminary data show that ODA reached USD 3.9 billion in 2015 (0.54% of GNI). Turkish Co-operation and Co-ordination Agency (TIKA) designs and co-ordinates Turkey’s bilateral co-operative activities of development and implements numerous projects in collaboration with other ministries, NGOs and various institutions in the private sector.
Challenges and Experiences in the Implementation of the Agenda: Breaking silos and working together on particular goals in an integrated manner will be a critical challenge for SDGs, due to the fact that this requires to change the current approaches in the particular policy making processes. Improving the usage and quality of administrative data, providing disaggregation and ensuring all stakeholders’ ownership of the Agenda are among the initial challenges that require immediate action.
Conclusions and Messages for the International Community: It is important to enable a mutual learning environment for all countries through the sharing of national reviews and processes. Turkey is willing to learn more about the other countries’ experiences on how they actually managed to integrate the SDGs and the Addis Ababa Action Plan into their own national agendas.

1Introduction      2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development offers an ambitious framework that urges countries to take action at all levels. The global agenda that such a framework presents has successfully provided a unique opportunity for countries not only to to integrate sustainable development policies into their national policy frameworks, but also to dealwith global challenges. In this process, strong ownership and leadership offered by governments is a key feature for effective and timely implementation. Success of the implementation of the SDGs depends on the right steps to be taken by governments at the very beginning of the process with active contribution of all stakeholders. They are the ones to be demonstrating the right strategies to integrate SDGs into their national development plans and perspectives in the long run. Government of Turkey is firmly dedicated to take action for the effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the objectives of which are reflected in Turkey’s national and international endeavors. Turkey welcomes the universal and integrated nature of the Sustainable Development Goals and embraces the “no one left behind” principle of this highly ambitious Agenda. To successfully implement the 2030 Agenda, and its complementary Addis Ababa Action Agenda, Turkey will accelerate its efforts to cooperate and engage a wide range of stakeholders including academia, civil society organizations, and private sector at local, national and international levels.
      The concept of sustainable development has a long history in Turkish policy environment. In Turkey, the legislative framework which supports sustainable development has been firmly established and the existing structure provides a conducive environment to achieve SDGs. Turkey has been consistently including and referring to sustainable development policies in its NDPs since 1992, following the Rio Summit. And the current 10th NDP of Turkey has placed sustainable development at its core with a green growth perspective. Turkey will definitely take the SDGs as a critical input in the process of drafting the vision of the next Plan in 2016 and integrate SDGs into the Plan itself.
      In Turkey, similar to MDG processes, the MoD plays the key role in the coordination of the implementation of the SDGs. The MoD has closely followed the international processes, including the Open Working Group and intergovernmental negotiations on SDGs. From the very outset of the implementation phase of the SDGs, the Ministry worked in close cooperation with all stakeholders for the preparation of the position of the country. Within the Ministry, a Task Force composed of relevant experts, has been assigned to integrate SDGs into public policy documents at all levels, including NDPs, regional plans, annual programs, and sectoral strategies. In terms of external coordination among line ministries and related organizations, the high level councils playing an important role in the decision making process will provide influential platforms to advance the SDGs. In this context, National Sustainable Development Commission (NSDC), with its renewed structure, will constitute a background for the high level technical setting  for the SDGs’ reviewing, implementation, monitoring, evaluation and international reporting processess.
      Specifically during the first year of SDGs, this National Report has been prepared under the coordination of MoD in close cooperation with all departments within the Ministry and with the contribution of all line ministries. Furthermore, a wide range of actors and representatives from NGOs, business institutions, academic community and the UN bodies were included to the process through online consultations. Based on these stakeholders’ feedback, the Report was finalized for the 2016 HLPF Meeting. For drafting the Report, several preparatory activities have been conducted. Several informative sessions had already been organized on SDGs and the 2030 Agenda within and outside the MoD. Monthly informative meetings within MoD, in addition to a couple of meetings among public institutions, and several other meetings among academia, private sector and NGOs have been held. Meetings with UN agencies and country offices have also been conducted. Thus, all stakeholders have had the chance to share their ideas during the preparatory process of the Report.
      Bearing in mind that each country will decide on the scope of their review and the format in which they want to present their voluntary national reviews, the National Report of Turkey focuses on the initial steps taken by the Government for implementing the SDGs.  The components of the Report are in line with the Secretary General’s Report and the proposal for common voluntary reporting guidelines. Since the main objective of the First National Report was primarily based on enabling mutual learning, the Report has covered the sustainable development background of Turkey with a particular focus on the policymaking process and institutional structure of the country. Specifically, MDG progress of Turkey, the coordination mechanism for implementing the goals and the corresponding targets, main features of the development cooperation program of the country and the concrete steps that will be taken to integrate SDGs into the 11th NDP are covered in the Report.

2Progress on the MDGs      Turkey’s MoD, formerly referred as State Planning Organization (SPO), is an advisory governmental body focusing on policy formulation, implementation, evaluation and monitoring of national development processes. It has been the primary institution that coordinates responsibilities for overseeing and monitoring the progress of the MDGs. Turkey’s first MDGs Report was produced in 2005 by SPO with the technical support of the UN Country Office. During the process of fulfilling its duty on MDGs, SPO worked together with the TurkStat and the UNDP Country Office.
      The Government of Turkey demonstrated its full commitment to the global pledge made by the world leaders in the Millennium Summit by aligning the MDGs with that of its national development priorities. The first MDGs Report of Turkey contributed significantly to the shaping of the country’s development policies and provided valuable input in preparation of the 9th Development Plan. Despite not being able to reach the same level for all, Turkey has advanced in all MDGs indicators, especially in the area of social development by implementing effective policies.
      In 2010, Turkey’s second MDG Report was prepared with the cooperative efforts of the SPO, and the technical support granted by the Office of the United Nations Resident Coordinator. Compared to the baseline study carried out in 2005, Turkey’s MDG Report for 2010 made it crystal clear that Turkey has made significant improvements with regard to the achievement of these development goals. According to the Report, although there were still challenges related to substantial rural/urban, regional and gender related inequalities, Turkey has managed to make considerable achievements in reducing poverty, achieving universal primary education, reducing maternal and infant mortality rates as well as ensuring environmental sustainability. In addition, Turkey has also successfully demonstrated its progressively increasing role in international development cooperation with special emphasis put on the Least Developed Countries (LDCs).
      And in the period between 2010 and 2015, Turkey accelerated its efforts to achieve MDGs. Turkey reached the MDG targets in the area of mother and infant health, registering sharp reductions in infant, children under five years of age, and maternal mortality rates with ease by the year 2015. Another area in which Turkey showed a remarkable improvement has been Goal 8. Turkey has considerably increased its Official Development Assistance (ODA) given to developing countries. Some specific goals such as the reduction in the proportion of children under five who are underweight, under-five mortality per 1,000 live births and access to improved water source – the ODA Progress chart has recognized Turkey to be among the top ten performers as measured by average annual rates of relative progress. The box below presents a brief summary of progress in terms of implemantaiton of specific goals:
Box 1: A Brief Summary of Progress by MDG
Goal 1: Eradicate Extreme Poverty and Hunger
The proportion of the population living under $1.25 a day, which was 1.1% in 1994 and 0.2% in 2002, was reduced to nil in 2006. The food poverty ratio, which was 1.35% in 2002, declined to 0.48% in 2009.
Goal 2: Achieve Universal Primary Education
Increasing access to quality education on the basis of equality of opportunity has been the main focus of Turkey. In this context, net enrollment rate in primary education for 2015-2016 has reached to 96.44%. In the last few years, important developments have been achieved in primary education, and the net enrolment ratio has nearly reached 100%.
Box 1: A Brief Summary of Progress by MDG (cont’d)1
Goal 3: Promote Gender Equality and Empower Women
The share of women in wage employment in non-agricultural sectors shows an increase from 17.7% in 2000 to 26.6%1 in 2015; though the increase was not very rapid during this period. On the other hand, after the global financial crisis that hit Turkish economy in 2008, the participation of women in the labor force has started to increase more rapidly. This is not only due to the increase in educational attainment of female citizens and declining fertility levels over time but also to the employment subsidies towards females. In fact, since 2008, employers are exempted from social security contributions for a limited period of time provided that they hire additional female workers. Still, labor force participation of women is relatively low in Turkey due to the low labor force participation of less educated women in urban areas.
Goal 4: Reduce child mortality
Based on the data issued by the Ministry of Health, child mortality rate for children under the age of five per 1,000 live births, which was 52.1, and infant mortality rate, which was 42.7 in 1998, declined to 9.7 and 7.6 respectively in 2014.
Goal 5: Improve maternal health
The success achieved regarding the rate of infant mortality was also achieved in that of maternal mortality, and similarly, in the last 10 years, Turkey has reached the same level of progress made by the OECD countries in the last 20 years in terms of maternal mortality. The maternal mortality rate per 100.000 live births, which was 132 in 1993 and 64 in 2002, declined to 15.2 in 2014.
Goal 6: Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases
Based on the data issued by the Ministry of Health, the total number of HIV infected cases diagnosed with AIDS in Turkey reported in the period between 1985 and 2013 is 1,103. The number of HIV infected cases diagnosed was 158 in 2000 and 93 in 2013.
Box 1: A Brief Summary of Progress by MDG (cont’d)
Goal 7: Environmental Sustainability
It is observed that the land area covered by forests in Turkey is increasing. While total forestland in 1973 was 26.1%, it went up to 26.6% in 1999 and to 27.7% in 2012.
Turkey’s Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions also illustrate an increase. Main reasons for this upward tendency are economic growth, population growth, increase in energy demand and industrialization.
While the ratio of municipal population who benefit from drinking and using water supplies was 95% in 2001, this ratio increased up to 97% in 2014 due to the extension of investments in that area. When the rate of using sanitation systems is considered, 75% of municipal population benefited from these services in 2001, while this rate increased up to 91% in 2014.
Goal 8: Develop a Global Partnership for Development
Turkey has expanded the scope of its development assistance to developing countries in 2000s. Turkey’s development aid increased from 85 million USD in 2002 to 3.6 billion USD in 2014. Turkey is also one of the biggest donors in humanitarian aid and the figure for 2014 in humanitarian aid is 1.8 billion USD. In 2014, Turkey’s development aid increased in real terms with respect to the previous year by 8.2 per cent.
      Following the first Millennium Development Goals Report on Turkey issued in 2005, Turkey’s 9th Development Plan, covering the period between 20072013, was prepared. In the process of drafting the 9th Development Plan, the aim of achieving the MDGs was taken into consideration, and Turkey’s development goals were designed in line with MDG targets. National policy documents prepared within the framework of the 9th Development Plan had also been in line with the Millennium Development Goals.  It should hereby be noted that integrating MDGs into national policy documents had contributed to policy coherence to the development challenges of the country. Building upon the MDG experience, Government of Turkey will ideally follow the same path to integrate SDGs into the existing national policy-making process and use the already established governmental structures.
      Monitoring the process of MDGs has also improved the capacity of public institutions. During the preparation of the MDG Progress Reports of Turkey, relevant goals and targets were analyzed. For each of the eight MDGs, the indicators for Turkey were described, starting with the oldest available data since 1990. Some important surveys carried out by universities have contributed to the monitoring process for filling the data gap. In the progress reports of Turkey, national policies of the country regarding MDG targets have been steered and the challenges have been identified. Developments anticipated in the near future have been predicted according to the available information and data; areas of weakness have been pinpointed, and expectations for the future have been set out. All these efforts have contributed to the enhancement of the country’s capacity to respond to globally set development agendas. This very capacity is considered an asset for the achievement of SDGs by 2030. Government of Turkey firmly aims to build on and address the unfinished business of the MDGs in order to implement SDGs in the best possible way for the 15 years to come.

3The Concept of Sustainable Development in Turkey’s PolicyEnvironment      In Turkey, sustainable development policies are already incorporated within numerous laws, legislations, regulations, policy documents and action plans in a variety of policy fields and sectors. Being defined as the highest-level national policy document in Turkey, Turkey’s National Development Plan (NDP) sets and puts forth all macro-level national policies and priorities. NDPs lead the society to achieve higher levels of prosperity and set long-term objectives and priorities beyond short-term approaches.
      NDPs are prepared by using a holistic and participatory planning approach that is consistent with long-term targets and takes into consideration inter-sectoral balance. During the NDPs’ preparatory period, Ad-hoc Committees (namely Special Expertise Committees) are convened in order to gather diverse viewpoints of the experts from various policy fields. Through these committees, the economic and social policy views, recommendations and targets of the diverse stakeholders in society are reflected in the NDP. Turkey has prepared ten development plans so far and MoD has launched the process of preparing the long terms vision of 11th Development Plan in 2016.
      For effective implementation of the Development Plans, medium term programs, annual programs, strategic plans, regional development plans and sectoral strategies have been prepared in accordance with the Plan. Public institutions determine their policies, investments, institutional and legal arrangements accordingly.
      The Medium Term Program (MTP), which initiates budget preparation processes, are annually prepared in compliance with the policies in the Plan for a three-year-period. It provides an opportunity for reviewing and sometimes renewing the priorities of the plan. The annual programs cover the measures that enable the implementation of the policies that are declared in NPD and MTP in the corresponding year.
      The principles and methods related to monitoring and evaluation of the Plan is set by a Cabinet Decree and performed by the Development Plan Monitoring and Direction Committee. This committee is chaired by the Undersecretary of the MoD and embodies high level administrators from related ministries.
      The development approach of the plans is inclusive and sustainable. It is based on strategic priorities, has a holistic view, and takes the country’s potential and requirements of being a social state. MoD has the duty to plan the development process with a participatory approach, and advise the Government, and provide guidance to all groups within the society in order to achieve sustainable development.
      Turkey has introduced the concept of sustainable development for the first time in 7th Development Plan in 1996 following 1992 Rio Conference. Recently, Rio+20 outcomes have been integrated into 10th Development Plan of Turkey.  One of the main axes of the 10th Development Plan is sustainability and the Plan is based on a “human-centered development” approach.
      The 10th Development Plan was prepared with a participatory approach by convening 66 ad-hoc committees and working groups on macroeconomic, sectoral and regional issues. More than three thousand academicians, public employees, private sector and non-governmental organization (NGO) representatives participated in and contributed to these committees. The planning processes were also carried out at the local level. Views of local administrations and local actors about development priorities of Turkey were received through Regional Development Agencies. More than seven thousand individuals and organizations across Turkey contributed to this task. When drafting the Plan ad-hoc committee reports, results of consultation meetings were utilized and all background documents were made available to public.
      The 10th Development Plan, covering the 2014-2018 period, is a milestone in advancing the Turkish society to high prosperity levels. The 10th Development Plan is designed to include not only high, stable and inclusive economic growth, but also issues such as the rule of law, information society, international competitiveness, human development, environmental protection and sustainable use of resources. As a part of this Plan, economic and social development processes of Turkey are discussed with a holistic and multidimensional view. In order to accelerate the development process by mobilizing potential, regional dynamics and human capabilities of Turkey, improving position of Turkey in international division of labor and value chain hierarchy progressively to higher levels in the reshaping the world economy is aimed.
      Compliance of the development plan with medium and long-term objectives, basic principles, targets and priorities of public institutions  and resource allocation is important for effective implementation of development policies. With the aim of ensuring compliance and integrity among all respective actors from the public sector actors, a policy set is formed that will lead and help them in determining their implementation programs by adopting an inclusive approach.
      The purpose of development is to permanently improve the well-being of people and raise the living standards, establish a fair, safe and peaceful living environment by strengthening fundamental rights and freedoms, which all constitute the pillars of sustainable development. The Plan consists of four main axes.
      The policies, which aim to adopt a participatory development approach with human focus and to extend the progress to different segments of the society, are covered under the “Qualified People, Strong Society” title. Objectives and policies for structural transformation of production and increase in welfare are discussed under the “Innovative Production, High and Stable Growth” title. Objectives and policies in the context of increasing social and economic benefits of environment-friendly approaches, enhancing urban and rural life quality in a sustainable way and reducing disparities between regions are placed under the title “Livable Places, Sustainable Environment”.
Main priorities and policies regarding the external dynamics of development and bilateral, regional and multilateral relations are examined under the “International Cooperation for Development” title.
      To achieve the objectives of the 10th Development Plan, 25 Priority Transformation Programs on crosscutting areas that require coordination and responsibility among institutions are designed, in order to solve main structural problems and contribute to the transformation process. In this context, the programs have been designed in a limited number of priority issues to facilitate monitoring and evaluation process of the 10th Development Plan, to make the programs manageable and their impacts measurable. In the context of these programs which have been prepared with a sectoral and cross-sectoral approach, central enforcement mechanism and intervention tools have been designed; institutions responsible for implementation and coordination have been determined; objectives have been set.
      Turkey believes that sustaining the existence of human beings in a strengthened way is only possible by realizing the principles of equity and sustainability. Turkey will further enhance the economic and social transformation programs implemented in the last 10 years which are compatible with and contribute to sustainable development goals in the forthcoming period. Turkey will maintain its important mission to accomplish global targets for sustainable development by utilizing the advantages of its increasing income and prosperity to the whole country by giving importance and priority to relatively disadvantaged segments of the society, and offering its experience and knowledge on sustainable development through bilateral and multilateral cooperation and aid programs to the world, especially in its region.
      The Government of Turkey regards the new sustainable development agenda as a unique opportunity to advance its development objectives both at national and international levels. 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development, having SDGs at its core, is closely reflects the objectives of Turkey and its national and international endeavors. After the adoption of SDGs, Government of Turkey conducted a rapid screening of the recent 10th Development Plan for looking at the consistency with SDGs. Although there is a need to explore what the global goals and targets mean in Turkey’s particular development policy environment, that preliminary analysis confirms a high degree of consistency between 10th Development Plan and the SDGs. In the box below the public policies of the 10th Development Plan have been categorized in the form of specific “goal”s for providing an instant idea about Turkey’s national agenda.
Box 2: Consistency of SDGs and 10th National Development Plan of Turkey
Goal 1. End poverty in all its forms everywhere
The plan aims at decreasing the absolute poverty to negligible levels and focusing on relative poverty. By ensuring easier access of the population segments that are under the risk of poverty and social exclusion to the opportunities, and by enhancing their participation to economic and social life, alleviating poverty may be fought in a systematic way. As for the needs of families, it is aimed to conduct the establishment of a supply-oriented and employment-linked system in the field of social services in an integrated way.
Goal 2. End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture
The Plan also aims at creating an agriculture sector that provides sufficient and balanced nutrition for the society, by utilizing advanced technologies, resolving infrastructural problems, and building up effective organization and high productivity in a sustainable manner. Effective stock management and diminishing the losses along the production, marketing and consumption chain are plannedIn order to ensure food security .
Goal 3. Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages
Encouraging healthy life-style and providing more accessible, convenient, effective and efficient health care services constitute another item of the Plan. Developing patients’ and health professionals’ safety and contentment is an important objective for healthcare provision. In order to provide effective and rational use of drugs, health service providers and citizens should be trained with the purpose of reaching wider awareness in the implementation period of the Plan.
Box 2: Consistency of SDGs and 10th National Development Plan of Turkey (cont’d)
Goal 4. Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all
Ensuring full access to primary and secondary education, especially for disabled and female students is one of the main objectives of the Plan. Between the years 20142018, social, mental, emotional and physical development of students will be expanded in a way that facilitates the access of disadvantaged families and regions to educational opportunities. In addition to this, quality-oriented transformation in the education system, strengthening compliance with the labor market within the framework of lifelong learning and an educational perspective based on equality of opportunity will continue in the implementation period of the Plan. Increasing the enrolment and attendance rates of girls, increasing the participation of youth who are not in education or employment to economic and social life are also targeted in the Plan.
Goal 5. Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls
In terms of gender equality, the main objectives of the Plan are to empower women in all aspects of social, economic and cultural life, to improve the status of family and to strengthen social integration.

In order to eliminate discrimination and violence against women, increasing the level of social consciousness with formal and informal education particularly starting from the early childhood is aimed.
Goal 6. Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all
Another objective of the Plan is to ensure public access to healthy, safe, drinkable and usable water. All of the requirements of settlements for drinkable and usable water be met, non-revenue water will be prevented, healthy and environment friendly material usage will be popularized through the improvement of current networks during the Plan period. The Plan also focuses on improving sanitation and wastewater treatment infrastructures in cities and encouraging reuse of treated wastewater.
Goal 7. Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all
The main objective of the Plan is to reach a competitive energy system that exploits domestic and renewable energy resources to the highest possible extent, to support the reduction of energy intensity of the economy, and to minimize waste and environmental effects of energy for a continuous, qualified, secure, minimum-cost energy to the end-user in energy supply. Within the period of the Plan, efficient use of energy in all sectors will be ensured and the ratio of loss and illegal use of electricity will be reduced to minimum.
      
Goal 8. Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all
One of the main objectives of the Plan is to accelerate the increase in welfare and ensure a high and stable growth with a long term perspective. The main strategy for high and stable growth is developing the private sector-led, open and competitive production structure. The main objective is to form a labor market in which decent job opportunities are provided to all segments of the society, skills of the labor force are upgraded and utilized effectively, gender equality and occupational health and safety conditions are ameliorated and flexicurity is embraced. Taking into account requirements of decent work, working conditions will be improved and wageproductivity relationship will be strengthened in the implementation period of the Plan. Moreover, it is planned to eliminate children’s deprivation stemming from poverty, to increase the enrollment and participation of youth, especially girls, in education and employment.  For a sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, green growth approach is aimed to be ensured through exploiting potentials of environment friendly approaches in terms of new job opportunities, income sources, product and technology development in areas like energy, industry, agriculture, transport, construction, services and urbanization.
Goal 9. Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation
In the Plan, green growth opportunities on many areas, specifically in areas such as industry, energy, agriculture, transportation, construction, services and urbanization, are aimed. And new business areas, R&D and innovation that provide environment sensitive economic growth will be supported in the Plan period. In order to develop internationally competitive and high value added new sectors, products and brands; R&D and innovation programs are aimed to be implemented. Increasing awareness about economic and social benefits of use of ICT and developing the skills related to these technologies are the main objectives in the Plan. Moreover, a transformation in the manufacturing industry is planned, with special emphasis placed upon innovativeness and corporate capabilities, effective contribution of regions to national productive activity, effective collaboration among sectors, green technology and sustainable production. Increasing productivity and domestic share in value added sectors is targeted by means of developing greener production capacity in the Plan.
Goal 10. Reduce inequality within and among countries
In the Plan, by ensuring that the population segments under risk of poverty and social exclusion may achieve easier access to opportunities, by enhancing their participation in economic and social life, increasing their quality of life and improving income distribution and alleviating poverty are the main objectives. Specifically, income distribution equality that reduces the heavy burden of taxes and opportunities for social transfers are aimed to be increased. As stated in the Constitution, guaranteeing fundamental rights and freedoms of all citizens and non-discrimination on the basis of gender, age, race, language, color, philosophical view, religion, sect, health condition, income, nationality, ethnic origin, immigration status and political views areregarded as essential elements of the Plan.
Goal 11. Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable
The issue of sustainable human settlement has a high level of importance for the implementation of the Plan. Policies are related to both urban and rural settlements and buildings; urban transformation, housing standards, disaster risk management and urban architecture issues are highlighted to achieve sustainable living areas in the Plan. Providing livable spaces with higher standards that conform to geographic conditions, preserving urban-rural differentiation, historical, cultural and environmental values; having larger public spaces in order to meet the needs of people and the society, are the main goals. Required measures will be taken in order to meet the basic housing needs of the people, especially for those with low income, and alternative and sound solutions will be developed for the housing problems throughout the Plan. Providing high standard of livable spaces, increasing public spaces that meet the needs of society are also covered asimportant targets. In the Plan, it is aimed to upgrade design and construction standards for building structures that are useroriented, safe, environment friendly, energy-efficient and architecturally aesthetic. In urban transport, utilization of information technologies and intelligent transport systems in traffic management is targeted. Strengthening the implementation mechanisms that will reduce disaster risks and building resilient buildings and infrastructure are other significant objectives to be listed.
Goal 12. Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns
The Plan sets a specific objective on sustainable consumption and production issues. In order to support sustainable production and consumption, environment friendly products will be encouraged in public procurement throughout the Plan. In order to foster innovation and green manufacturing capacities of domestic firms, public procurement is to be used as an effective tool. Practices towards improving environmental consciousness, especially protection of nature and support of sustainable consumption will be promoted between the years 2014-2018.
Environmental sensitivity and life quality are planned to be improved with practices such as waste and emission reduction, energy, water and resource efficiency, recycling, prevention of noise and visual pollution, use of environment friendly material in line with sustainable urban approaches. Developing greener production capacity via green technology and sustainable production are also aimed.
Goal 13. Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts
In the Plan, adapting and combatting climate change are to be maintained in line with the principles of “common but differentiated responsibilities” and “respective capabilities” while considering national circumstances. By evaluating the effects of climate change and all activities in catchments on water quantity and quality, measures for saving water, combatting drought and preventing pollution are put emphasis between the years 2014-2018.
Goal 14. Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development
In the Plan, maritime safety is given utmost importance. It is planned to establish safe maritime navigation corridors. In the fisheries sector, carrying out efficient resource management based on scientific data is one of the main objectives. Environmental sustainability is given high priority taking into consideration  the aqua cultural activities. Additionally, institutional capacity will be strengthened throughout the Plan.
Goal 15. Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss
The main objective hereafter is ensuring detection, protection, sustainable use, development and monitoring of bio diversity that is important for agriculture, forests, food and pharmaceutical industry. Efficient use of land and water resources and overseeing the balance between protection and utilization of natural resources are considered as a priority. Taking effective measures is planned with the purpose of protecting high quality agriculture lands and forests. Efforts for combatting desertification and erosion will be improved and monitoring environmental and social impacts of agricultural activities on agricultural land resources will be launched throughout the Plan. Besides, efficient management of production and marketing of wood and non-wood forest products, especially industrial products, are main targets. The Plan also maintains that, in forestry, capacity to fight against fires, pests and diseases is to be improved; afforestation and rehabilitation activities are to be accelerated.
Goal 16. Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels
The Plan further maintains that in order to improve the accessibility of justice, the right of defense and judicial assistance are to be enhanced. As stated in the Constitution, guaranteeing fundamental rights and freedoms of all citizens and non-discrimination on the basis of gender, age, race, language, color, philosophical views, religion, health conditions, income, nationality, ethnic origin, immigration status and political views is considered essential in the Plan. The main objective is to constitute a social structure that respects all religious beliefs and life styles as a fundamental principle that is convenient for individuals and different segments of society to express themselves freely through a pluralist perspective of liberal democracy. Fundamental rights and freedoms are to be continuously enhanced in the light of the universal criteria and practices. Within the framework of pluralist and participatory democratic political processes, strengthening mechanisms to get opinions and preserving the viewpoints of different social groups and NGOs are two of the the main objectives.
Goal 17. Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development
The main objective is to attain a higher level of national, administrative and human resources capacity in order to strengthen the international dynamics of development process of Turkey, with the ultimate purpose of sharing knowledge and experience with countries in need and attaining sustainable and strong economic, social and cultural relations in international cooperation activities. Via the Plan, it is aimed to provide better quality and stronger contribution to the global development agenda through effective participation in international organizations, to accelerate the efforts towards the improvement of global governance, and to develop relations at global scale, particularly with emerging economies and LDCs.
Turkey will carry out active policies on multilateral platforms to improve global economic governance and make every effort to ensure closer cooperation and coordination among member states. The aid committed to the LDCs is planned to be used in line with the strategies aiming at developing the capacity of the target countries and also improving long-term economic and trade relations. Moreover, institutional and operational cooperation with international aid organizations, the UN in particular, is to be enhanced as a part of the Plan.
      
      Briefly, the recent 10th Development Plan of Turkey has placed sustainable development at its core with a human-centered development approach. The 10th Development Plan has reflected the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development in a balanced way and has put special emphasis on the international cooperation for development. Green growth perspective has also been covered by the 10th Development Plan. Having a strong ground for sustainable development at the highest level policy document, Turkey is completely dedicated to operationalize 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in line with its national circumstances. By this endeavor, Turkey is committed to take the SDGs as a critical input when drafting the vision of the next Plan in 2016 and to integrate SDGs into the 11th Development Plan.

4Integration of SDGs into the National Development Plan      As it was discussed broadly in the previous section, the 10th NDP of Turkey covers almost all 17 SDGs, some more directly and some more indirectly. Following the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development at the Summit held in New York in September 2015, Turkish Government initially referred to the outcome of the Summit in 2016 Annual Program, which is a high level policy document approved by the High Planning Council and the Council of Ministers. The Annual Program follows the systematic guidance of the Plan and sets out the objectives and policies to be pursued in 2016. So, in the middle of the period of 10th NDP, as a practical approach, MoD outlined 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in the 2016 Annual Program, including Addis Ababa Process. In the Program, it is emphasized that Turkey’s development policies mirror the global shift to sustainable development with all its three dimensions. And it is also stated that green growth perspective has been gaining importance on the national context in line with international developments. In the Program, as a first step for integrating SDGs into national policies, conducting a stocktaking analysis study for determining current status of Turkey in terms of SDGs has been programmed. This study will be completed under the coordination of MoD with the help of other line ministries, private sector, academia and the NGOs. It will detect the shortcomings of the country and identify the priority areas to put the country on a sustainable development pathway. Stocktaking analysis has been scheduled after the HLPF Meeting in 2016 for learning from other countries’ experiences and carrying those experiences onto the implementation process.
      Stocktaking analysis will be the first concrete action taken by the Turkish Government in the implementation process. This analysis will serve as an important instrument for framing the development policies of Turkey in the next NDP period.
      During the budget negotiations in the Parliament, Turkish government’s dedication to adjust SDG agenda and its targets to national policies and to advance their implementation has been stated at the ministerial level. This statement indicates the intention of Turkish Government to support SDG-linked projects and programmes of public institutions by allocating adequate resources.
      Furthermore, in the case of some particular SDGs, public institutions are already working on integrating SDG targets into their strategic plans or action plans. Migration, women’s empowerment, health, agriculture and food are the pioneer fields that these institutions have started to work for nationalizing SDGs. Additionally, some business related organizations have started to prioritize SDGs.
      Those concrete steps for nationalizing SDGs will be followed by steps for mainstreaming 2030 Agenda into the 11th NDP. Turkey is currently at the stage of preparing long term vision of 11th NDP. That long term vision provides the development perspective of the Plan by taking into account the international and national trends in development landscape and serves as the starting point for drafting the Plan itself. Key importance have already been attached to SDGs in outlining the long term vision of the Plan. Therefore, taking SDGs as one of the main inputs of the long term vision of the 11th Plan will pave the way to insert SDGs into the 11th NDP itself.
      NDPs are adopted in Turkey after deliberate discussions, consultations and a long participatory process. Even though the new global agenda attracts positive interest among policy makers, there is a huge challenge remaining to transfer SDGs into the operational level. For responding this challenge, raising awareness on SDGs during the preparations process of the Plan is highly important. This entails conducting various events for engaging all the stakeholders to the process. The Government of Turkey is ready to work together with the civil society, academia, private sector, international organizations and the local authorities in drafting process of the Plan.
      Additionally, producing innovative policy tools for empowering the preparations of the Plan and facilitating its ownership at national and local levels is a must for integrating SDGs to the 11th Development Plan. Those policy tools will provide evidence-based information for the prioritization of SDGs and identifying the need for action. Turkish Government will also work closely with international actors and organizations in this endeavor. This partnership will no doubt lead to a mutual learning environment for all and serve as a capacity building program at the same time.

5Institutional Mechanisms to Implement SDGs      Founded in 1960, SPO was reorganized as the MoD in June 2011. MoD of the Republic of Turkey is an expert based organization which plans and guides Turkey’s development process at macro level and focuses on the coordination of policies and strategy development in line with global and regional trends and challenges.
      Since sustainable development requires a multi-sectoral and multistakeholder perspective, it has aspects related to the responsibilities and duties of different public institutions. MoD, which administers the planning and programming process among these institutions, is the national coordination authority of sustainable development in Turkey.
      In order to provide an integrated perspective to the diversified institutional structure, National Sustainable Development Commission (NSDC) was established under the Ministry of Development in 2004. The coordination, monitoring and assessment of sustainable development became partially possible with the participation and active engagement of Climate Change Coordination Board, National Committee for Combatting Desertification, Energy Saving Coordination Board, Energy Efficiency Coordination Board, High Commission of Environment, National Biological Diversity Committee, High Commission Disasters and Emergency, High Commission of Science and Technology and Economical and Social Council. In spite of high level representation from respective government institutions, private sector, academia and NGOs in these commissions, there is still need for a dedicated commission on sustainable development given the ambitious targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Moreover, NSDC needs to evolve into a more functional commission to become more suitable for the broad and interlinked nature of SDGs, as well as to establish high level political ownership.
      In the near future, NSDC will be strengthened and widened in line with its coordinating role, particularly because implementation and reporting processes of the SDGs will be taken into account to maintain the comprehensive nature of the 2030 Agenda. The Government of Turkey has been planning to extend the role of the Commission by increasing the number of its members, with the purpose of creating an integrated and holistic approach to the drivers and progresses of SDGs. MoD will undertake the responsibilities of the secretariat within the NSDC, while the Commission will serve as the central political body in the follow-up and review process of SDGs. The Commission will provide periodical reporting to the High Planning Council, Cabinet and Turkish Grand National Assembly.
      In the implementation phase of the Agenda, Turkey believes that political ownership and commitment are crucial factors when trying to reach successful outcomes.  Taking into account the comprehensive and universal nature of SDGs, political ownership at the highest possible level and effective coordination among all stakeholders will be essential for translating the global vision of the SDGs into sustainable national actions. As for promoting the SDGs at national and local levels, using the existing structures and current high level councils are considered as a practical approach. For instance, High Planning Council chaired by the Prime Minister, (the secretariat of which is under the MoD) is the first national council that comes to mind for acting effectively on national policies. High Planning Council functions as a political mechanism for integrated decision making in terms of policy formulation and for integrating sustainable development principles into implementation and will also perform the role as political platforms for national implementation of SDGs.
      At this stage, the Government of Turkey is discussing the options for transferring the SDGs to the highest possible level. A draft ministerial circular has been recently prepared. However, many processes and decisions still need to be finalized through political endeavors in the near future. Therefore, especially institutional arrangements of  Turkey’s roadmap for implementing SDGs are still at preliminary stage to be completed only by the end of 2016.
      But above all, the Ministry of Development, the Ministry that is in charge of the National Development Plans of Turkey, will follow a policy coherence approach at the center of the implementation process of SDGs. Given the coordination role of Ministry of Development and macro level place of national development plans at the top of policy making process in Turkey, the task of implementing SDGs will be fulfilled by all ministries. The distribution of responsibilities to implement SDGs will support the integration of SDGs into all relevant strategy and policy documents at central and local levels.
      Thanks to this mechanism, it is envisaged that SDGs and its relevant targets will be reflected in current strategies and work plans of institutions. Respective budget allocations will be ensured through this mechanism. Ministry of Development, as the coordinative body for developing national plans, programs and investment budgets will closely follow the whole process and ensure vertical and horizontal policy coordination.

6Public Awareness and Ownership for SDGs      An important lesson learnt from the MDGs in Turkey has been about the involvement of media and the civil society organizations throughout the process.  Public discussion around the MDGs – in media and by NGOs – was not active enough in the first ten years of the MDGs. When it first started, public consultations that involve civil society organizations played a minimal role in discussions on the adoption of goals. However, they did play a role in campaigning and supporting ground level implementation of sector specific programs, particularly in health and education.
      Media discussion around the MDG goals has similarly been passive. Having learnt from the MDGs implementation process, Turkey aims to guarantee a national setting that complies with the effective contribution of all relevant stakeholders for the planning, implementation and review of SDGs.
      For the new global development agenda, new mechanisms have to be created in order to establish strong communicative ties among different segments of the society. The participation of different stakeholders such as local administrations, academia, NGOs, and private sector in the policy formulation and implementation regarding sustainable development will be accelerated with regard to principles concerning the inclusiveness, accountability and transparency. Improving dialogues especially among women, children, and youth is important for providing participation at the widest level, with the ultimate purpose of achieving SDGs. Additionally, the principle of “leaving no one behind” means reaching to everyone for ensuring that every individual achieves the full package of opportunities expressed by the SDGs.
      Turkey is aware of the fact that NGOs have a great potential for extending sustainable development perspective and  spreading them to all levels of the society. It is obvious that what is urgently necessary is to ensure mechanisms that will trigger this potential.  Within the scope of Rio+20 national preparation processes, different stakeholders are invited to share their projects that aim at sustainable development. 181 applications from public institutions, actors from the private sector, NGOs and academia have submitted. With the help of independent assessment procedures, the contribution of these projects to sustainable development has been rated in a two-staged evaluation so that 24 “best practice examples” are defined. This study indicates successful implementations and fields having high potential and areas that Turkey has to give more priority.	Turkey intents to carry this experience into the implementation process of SDGs and create similar opportunities that will serve mutual learning.

      The vision and responsibilities of the private sector (as the chief producers of goods and services) to enhance sustainable development bear vital importance at every levels. The main principle is to increase productivity and competitiveness by minimizing input costs. This will contribute to the protection of natural resources. In Turkey, extreme effort has been made to utilize legal and financial instruments to help increase productivity and competitiveness of the private sector. Turkey believes that national SDG processes will also contribute to the empowerment of business environment from a point of view that favors sustainable development.

7SDG Indicators and How to Monitor Progress      Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat) will have the central role for the monitoring part of the Agenda based on global SDG indicators. TurkStat has contributed to the whole global process that was started in 2014 for adopting global sustainable development indicator list. Apart from the international consultation process on SDGs, TurkStat has also been involved also in regional initiatives and consultation processes mainly conducted by the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE). In addition, TurkStat signed the “Declaration on the role of national statistical offices in measuring and monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals” that was adopted at the 63rd plenary session of the Conference of European Statisticians. Through this declaration, signatory countries declared the national statistical offices’ commitment to contribute their expertise to measure SDGs in a professional, independent and impartial way.
      In Turkey, official statistics are produced and issued by TurkStat and the related institutions specified in the Official Statistics Programme. Data compilation, evaluation and dissemination responsibilities of the institutions are also defined in that programme. TurkStat; the official body for the coordination of production and publication of official statistics, is authorized to publish and disseminate the official statistics compiled by related institutions. The Official Statistical Programme is prepared in a period of every five years in order to define the principles and standards regarding official statistics production and dissemination; and to ensure the production of up-to-date, reliable, timely and unbiased statistical data at national or international levels.
      The coordination of Turkish Statistical System was assigned to TurkStat. Turkey is one of the signatory countries of CES declaration mentioned above. Therefore, both the data that will be compiled by UN umbrella organizations and the indicators that will be produced in Turkish Statistical System have to operate after passing through the filter of official data producers and supervision of TurkStat.
      TurkStat is planning to coordinate the monitoring process by cooperating with other institutions through the Official Statistics Programme, which will be shaped by Statistical Council. Thematic working groups composed of TurkStat and other data producer institutions are responsible for conducting the Official Statistics Programme. In 2016, existing working groups of the forthcoming “Official Statistical Program 2017-2021” will address the needs for SDG indicator gaps. Moreover, a new Official Statistical Program working group which is dedicated to the monitoring of SDGs will be established, in order to operate between 2017-2021 for a five-year period.
      After the adoption of SDGs in September 2015, United Nations Statistical Commission (UNSC) has accomplished its mandate and adopted the global indicator list at its 47th session in March 2016. After the agreement on 241 global indicators, TurkStat has started the first internal inventory study in April 2016. In this inventory study, for each indicator, the production status is mainly inquired. Additionally, the data producer institution (TurkStat or other institutions) are inquired for available indicators and potential data producer institutions are attained for non-produced indicators.
      However it should be kept in mind that the results of this inventory study are only provisional. That is because the inventory study needs to be completed through an in-depth research that contains face to face evaluations with data producers of each indicator and requires more complete metadata.
      Provisional results of the inventory study carried out by TurkStat, is reported based on 241 indicator rows. The study reveals that 108 of total 241 indicators (45%) are currently produced in Turkish Statistical System and the rest (55%) are not produced. Of these 108 available indicators, 53 of them (49%) are produced by TurkStat and 55 of that (51%) are produced by other institutions. It should be noted that the status of each indicator is described as “produced” independent of having data disaggregations or not.
Table 1. Provisional Distribution of SDG Indicators Status, March 2016
Number% in Total% in GroupProduced10844,8100,0TurkStat5322,049,1Other Institutions5522,850,9Non-Produced13355,2100,0TurkStat2811,621,1Other Institutions9037,367,7Undefined156,211,3Total241100,0      Another result is that, TurkStat will be responsible for producing 28 indicators out of 133 non-produced indicators (21%). 14 indicators out of 28 are evaluated as likely to be produced within three years. Moreover, the work started already to produce 8 indicators out of these 14 indicators.
      Other institutions which are responsible for producing official statistics are attained as the potential producers for 90 indicators out of a total of 133 nonproduced indicators (68%). It should be repeated that indicators that are appointed to partner institutions by TurkStat, have not been examined in detail with these institutions in this pre-assessment stage of inventory study.
      On the other hand, 15 indicators out of 133 non-produced indicators (11%) could not be assigned to any potential producer institutions (Table 1).
These 15 indicators cover indicators that are not related to Turkish Statistical System (landlocked countries, relating to the least developed countries’ indicators etc.), or country tracking indicators of certain qualifications and unattained indicators due to lack of metadata.
      The most striking result of the inventory study is that 45% of SDG indicators are currently produced in Turkish Statistical System independent of having disaggregations. After completing the first assessment study on sustainable development indicators; this step will be finalized throug in depth review with other institutions, allowing to describe a portrait of Turkish Statistical System with its capacity and to identify gaps on methodology and on data production. The next step should be scheduling a calendar for non-produced indicators which necessitate a prioritization of targets on the national level.
      It is obvious that the best monitoring and follow up of sustainable development goals can be attained by improving administrative record basis of the statistical system of Turkey. According to the provisional results of the first inventory study, 68% of non-produced indicators are likely to be produced by partner institutions based on their administrative records. Thus, statistical capacity of Turkey needs to be improved especially through the modernization of the registry systems of data producing institutions and developing high quality official statistics, based onhigh quality registry data generated by data producers.
      In the light of the evaluations stated above, the national roadmap on monitoring will include following steps;
• Completion of the inventory study by working in close cooperation with other institutions. What is more, once the indicators and metadata are clarified in a global level, the inventory study will be reassessed.
• Integrating other institutions to the SDG monitoring system and making them embody the essential values of SDGs framework.
• Following the national action plan and prioritization of targets; classifying the non-produced indicators in categories of being produced in the short term, mid-term and long term. Scheduling the calendar for each category.
• Identifying the needs for non-produced indicators to contribute capacity building efforts.
• Exploring the possibilities of developing national indicators which will be considered through national priorities and which will be complementary to the global and regional indicators.
• Improving statistical infrastructure and establishing data sharing mechanisms to fill data gaps and exploiting new technological opportunities to achieve an effective data dissemination system for SDG indicators.
• Following other countries best practices on SDGs monitoring, reporting and dissemination.
• Contributing to the global efforts for enhancing evaluation and monitoring framework for SDGs and sharing Turkish experience through conferences and forums.
      In addition to indicators, indices could also prove useful in monitoring progress and communicating this progress to the public or decision makers effectively. For this purpose, a SDG index is planned to be developed for Turkey. This index will be more practical to measure the progress compared to the use of hundreds of indicators for the interdisciplinary fields.
      Although monitoring the progress on the 2030 Agenda will be mainly carried out by TurkStat, the voluntary monitoring and reporting by private sector will also be encouraged. For instance, sustainability reporting that could be done under various reporting standards will be a contribution of the private sector. In Turkey, a successful example to the involvement of private sector to the sustainability monitoring is the BIST Sustainability Index. That index, launched in 2014, aims to provide a benchmark for Borsa Istanbul companies with high performance on corporate sustainability and to increase the awareness, knowledge and practice on sustainability in Turkey.
8Development Cooperation Setting of Turkey and PossiblePartnerships for Future Collaboration      International development cooperation plays an important role in complementing the domestic efforts of countries to achieve sustainable development, especially in the poorest and most vulnerable countries with limited resources. The 2030 Agenda puts emphasis on that aspect and aims to enhance development cooperation, in order to provide adequate and predictable means for developing countries, in particular least developed countries, to implement programmes and policies to end poverty in all its dimensions.
      Turkey has advanced its cooperation efforts in the international arena in recent years comparable to her economic growth, and has taken actions of economic, commercial, technical, social, cultural and educational cooperation in all parts of the world, regardless of development levels of partnering countries. To that end, Turkey has further reinforced, through new actions, the already strong, long-standing relations and cooperation with countries in the Balkans, Caucasus and Central Asia. Turkey has also extended its friendly hand to all those in need in the Middle East and Africa. Projects have been developed to respond to emergency needs of peoples in those regions; and the necessity to solve chronic problems of the region have given Turkey valuable experience in furthering development cooperation.
      Turkey’s development cooperation is provided in line with legal framework adopted in 2011. The Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency (TIKA) designs and coordinates Turkey’s bilateral development cooperation activities and implements projects in collaboration with other ministries, NGOs and the private sector. Other public institutions, NGOs and those from the private sector also implement projects and programmes funded through Turkey’s ODA.
      TIKA carries out bilateral cooperation projects and programs through its more than 50 world-wide program coordination offices. As a result of the positive developments in Turkish economy, Turkey has increased its ODA figures and has reinforced its development cooperation in recent years, leading to being denominated as an emerging donor. In 2014, Turkey’s net ODA amounted to USD 3.6 billion, representing an increase of 15% in real terms over 2013. The ratio of ODA as a share of GNI rose from 0.40% in 2013 to 0.45% in 2014. Preliminary data show that ODA reached USD 3.9 billion in 2015 (0.54% of GNI).
      Turkish ODA by major category focus on the sectors of social infrastructure and services (62.4%), economic infrastructures and services (7.8%), production (1.4%) and cross-cutting issues (28.4%).
      In accordance with the commitments made in the 4th United Nations Conference on Least Developed Countries (LDCs) in Istanbul, Turkey has implemented cooperation projects within those countries with over 200 million USD aid flows originating from the country. Since 2011, excluding humanitarian aid, almost 20% of the Turkish total ODA was delivered to LDCs. Turkey will continue to share its sustainable development experiences with the rest of the world in the context of development cooperation activities.
      There is no doubt that international development agenda is rather intense and billions of people live in difficult conditions devoid of even basic needs. Turkey has started to take more responsibility than ever in international development agenda. To facilitate development cooperation activities in a more systematic way, there is a priority transformation program in the 10th Development Plan. Program for Improving the Infrastructure of International Cooperation For Development is designed to  establish a strategic framework for the development cooperation policy; strengthening the legal basis together with financial, institutional and human capacity for development cooperation; using development cooperation opportunities for improving the social welfare of Turkey and partner countries; increasing the awareness about international cooperation and strengthening cultural cooperation between Turkey and partner countries.
      Turkey is ready to make every effort to contribute to the achievement of SDGs all around the world. SDG-17 on means of implementation and the remaining goal-specific means of implementation targets will provide guidance in TIKA’s operational activities. To this end, Turkey sees both NorthSouth and South-South Cooperation as valuable instruments for international development cooperation; therefore it works for comprising its own policies in accordance with these modalities.
      On the other hand, Turkey’s figures over ODA/GNI have recently been quite positive. It is highly expected that this upward trend will continue in the following years. Turkey, as an emerging donor country, would like to continue to increase its contributions to global sustainable development and diversify its activities. The process of Turkey to become an emerging donor country was in parallel with the adoption of MDGs. In this regard, there is no doubt that this process will continue within the scope of SDGs.
      Turkey will continue to geographically widen its technical cooperation activities and diversify the sectors. Also, within the framework of South-South Cooperation, Turkey will continue to establish new partnerships. In addition, of the increase in triangular cooperation projects (another ODA modality) is likely to take place in Turkey’s future partnership activities.
      Turkey also recognizes the importance of bilateral and multilateral cooperation for sustainable development in terms of mobilizing finance, partnerships and assistance. Turkey, being a candidate country pursuing accession negotiations with the EU, a member of G-20, OECD and the Standing Committee for Economic and Commercial Cooperation of the Organization of the Islamic Cooperation (COMCEC), prioritizes sustainable development in the bilateral and multilateral cooperation activities. For example, under the presidency of G-20, Turkey moved the emphasis from growth to development and highlighted inclusiveness. Moreover at the G-20 Summit, an action plan is decided to be prepared for the implementation of 2030 Agenda.  Following this decision, Turkey submitted her national actions to G-20. In November 2015, MoD prepared a report titled “Turkey’s Sustainable Development Pathway towards Agenda 2030” which is submitted to COMCEC. In addition, sustainable development is one of the strategic goals in the partnership strategy formed with the World Bank and in the development cooperation strategy developed with United Nations (UN). Sustainable development is included as a component when international financial resources (GEF, World Bank, EBRD, FAO etc.) are utilized.
      Considering the significance of sharing information and widening our experiences, to ensure sustainable development at each level, particularly at regional level, Turkey contributes to sustainable development by raising awareness and advocacy via hosting international and regional activities. Second UN Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat II Summit) in 1996, Regional Meeting of Millennium Development Goals in 2010, the Fourth United Nations Conference on Least Developed Countries, 2nd International Entrepreneurship Summit in 2011 and Global Human Development Forum in
2012, SDGs themed 31st COMCEC Inter-ministerial Meeting in 2015 and World Humanitarian Summit in 2016 were all held in Istanbul. In 2013, as a result of Turkey’s increasing role on the international arena, the United Nations Development Programme’s Regional Service Centre for Europe and Commonwealth of Independent State (UNDP-RSC) was opened in Istanbul in 2013. Moreover in 2015, the 12th session of Conference of Parties (COP12) to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) was held in Ankara. In this conference, Turkey launched Ankara Initiative, a multilateral platform for actions that specifically combat desertification, drought and land degradation, committing 5 million dollars as its contribution, as well as capacity-building training. In addition, in Antalya, tenth G-20 Summit was held in 2015 and the High-level Midterm review of the implementation of the Istanbul Programme of Action (IPoA), which was adopted at the Fourth United Nations
Conference on the Least Developed Countries, was undertaken in 2016. Turkey is also a candidate for hosting COP-26 for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to be held in 2020.

9Challenges and Experiences in the Implementation of theAgenda      The planning paradigm is shifting as a result of dominant global trends that bring about economic systems with a more active and effective private sector and a public sector that increasingly focuses on regulatory activities, supervision and coordinative functions. Although open economies with free markets have become more common, ongoing impact of the global crisis reveals the importance of public sectors’ strategic moves about policy-making and preventive measures. In this context, national plans that are prepared with a strategic perspective and broad participation of all stakeholders have increasingly become more important.
      The increasing interaction between sectors, the impact of policy implementations in a variety of fields, thus the necessity of an interdisciplinary approach to overcome the challenges, together reshape the scope and content of development plans. While this requires a comprehensive approach that covers all sectors, it also highlights programmatic approaches that handle sectors in relation to each other.
      Turkey offers an enabling environment for institutional structuring of the public administration, distribution of duties and responsibilities among public authorities and ownership at all levels. And in line with the global changes, there is a shift in the development paradigm of the country to the integrated development approach at NDPs since 9th Development Plan of Turkey, covering the period between 2007-2013. In that Plan, thematic analysis was the main instrument for responding to the development challenges of the country. This plan aimed to avoid sectoral analysis and looked at the problems with an interdisciplinary manner. However, breaking down the silos at policy level is not an easy task and does not always bring an interdisciplinary perspective at operational levels. There are still various bottlenecks in the decision making process for breaking down the silos that will create challenges in the implementation phase of the SDGs.
      Many institutions still have hierarchical, siloed, and fragmented processes and cultures and are working across institutional boundaries. Especially working on a task as comprehensive as SDGs is rather difficult under these circumstances and will take time and resources at all levels.
      The real challenges are to coordinate efforts across different sectors and functions, keep all institutions and stakeholders focused on the delivery of the actions and gain political ownership on the process. For overcoming these challenges, new and innovative communication tools are urgently required. A series of structured and facilitated forums for bringing people together across levels, functions, and geographies to solve common problems are a prerequisite for the achievement of this ambitious global agenda by 2030. Turkey is ready to engage with all stakeholders at national level and international forums for having a mutual learning environment in that long and challenging journey.
      Another challenge of the implementation process of SDGs is so called “data revolution”. Although 47th session of UNSC has adapted a global indicator list to monitor sustainable development until 2030, there exists a large number of unclear issues related to this monitoring process. Some of these issues may be listed as; uncertainty in indicator list itself (some of the indicators are subject to be revised), inadequacy of metadata and absence of data flow procedures.
   Another dimension of that challenge is the funding of the data revolution. Fulfilling an effective monitoring process based on disaggregated data can only be accomplished by making investments on data generation. And channeling financial resources on capacity building programs and projects will not be an easy task given the budget pressures.
10 Conclusions and Messages for the International Community
      In the context of new development agenda, Turkey believes that continuing its human centered development approach which has the main axis of equality and sustainability is crucial. Turkey’s utmost priority at the moment is fighting poverty for ensuring an honorable life quality for each and every citizen. Additionally, a peaceful society, ensuring rule of law and good governance are enablers of our goals and targets and support a level playing field for all. Turkey views rule of law, peace, governance and strong institutional capacity as the 4th pillar of sustainable development. Without these inevitable elements, it is almost impossible to realize goals and targets.
      Since speeding up sustainable development requires mobilization of financial resources, it is necessary to use existing financial resources in an effective and productive manner, as well as creating innovative cooperation for future collaborations. Considering the principle “Ensuring that no one is left behind”, Turkey will maintain its important mission to accomplish global sustainable development goals for offering its experience and knowledge on sustainable development through bilateral and multilateral cooperation and aid programs to the world, especially in its close region. But in the field of development cooperation, it is not visible to reach SDGs by following an approach that solely maintans the idea “business as usual”. Since ODA can not be sufficient to implement Agenda 2030, not only the sources should be increased but also efficiency should be improved. As stated in Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) there is a need for new sources of finance. In this respect, private sector investments could be employed, in addition to the advancements to be made in ODAs.
