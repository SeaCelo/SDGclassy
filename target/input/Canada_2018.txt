The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development presents Canada and the world with a historic opportunity to positively shape how societies of tomorrow grow and develop sustainably and inclusively to the shared benefit of all. It is an opportunity to build a more prosperous and resilient future where the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development are advanced in a balanced and integrated way, \0xECleaving no one behind. 
Canada is committed to implementing the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at home and abroad. As Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in his address to the 
United Nations in September 2017, 
\0xECthe SDGs are as meaningful in Canada as they are everywhere else in the world.
Canadais Voluntary National Review underscores the Government of Canadais commitment to implement all 17 SDGs and the principles that underpin the 2030 Agenda, including \0xECleaving no one behind. As Canadais first review, this report takes stock of national actions, achievements and challenges, and identifies next steps in implementing the 2030 Agenda. Canadais implementation of the 2030 Agenda is a work in progress. While Canada has attained an overall high standard of social and economic development, three million Canadians 
still struggle to satisfy their basic needs. Indigenous peoples, women, youth, the elderly, the LGBTQ2 community, newcomers to Canada and persons with disabilities are more likely to face poverty, discrimination and social exclusion. 
Canada is responding to these challenges through concrete actions to reduce poverty, advance gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, narrow the socioeconomic gaps that exist between different groups, foster inclusion and celebrate diversity, and improve equality of opportunity for all.  
While Canada has a relatively small population, it also has a large landmass with most of it located in the northern half of the northern hemisphere. These factors contribute to relatively heavier energy and transportation needs. To respond to these national circumstances, the Government of Canada is taking firm action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and support clean technology and innovation. 
Canadais priorities at the global level align with its priorities domestically. In June 2017, Canada announced its Feminist International Assistance Policy, which seeks to eradicate poverty and build a more peaceful, more inclusive and more prosperous world. Canada firmly believes that promoting gender equality and empowering women and girls is the most effective way to achieve this goal and drive progress on all SDGs. 
National strategy and coordinating structures
The Government of Canadais policies, programs and priorities are already well-aligned to the SDGs. Canadais 2018 federal budget allocated new funds to establish an SDG Unit to ensure effective 2030 Agenda coordination across federal departments and agencies and with Canadian stakeholders, and to track Canadais progress on the SDGs. Federal departments and agencies have been tasked to further examine how their policies and programs are contributing to the 2030 Agendais goals and targets. Canada will mainstream a gender-responsive perspective in the implementation of the SDGs, consistent with its emphasis on gender equality as a cross-cutting priority.
The Government of Canada will launch a process in the coming months to develop a national strategy on the 2030 Agenda through collaboration with all levels of government, Indigenous peoples, civil society and the private sector. Data is key to developing solutions to challenges facing the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, to ensure no one is left behind, and to track progress on the SDGs. As such, this report includes validated Canadian data for the SDG Global Indicator Framework.
Partnerships
Canada recognizes that innovative, multi-stakeholder partnerships are essential to achieving the 2030 Agenda, including to mobilize additional sources of capital in support of the SDGs. Across Canada, governments, organizations and individuals are already answering the 2030 Agendais call to action and convening new partnerships to respond in new ways to the challenges we collectively face. Going forward, the Government of Canada will strengthen efforts to bring together all segments of society in Canada around the SDGs, including in the development of the national strategy. Canada will also continue to work with its domestic and international partners to foster new and innovative solutions to realize this historic and transformative agenda.
 

Leaving no one behind: building a more peaceful, more inclusive and more prosperous world  

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is among the defining global frameworks of our time. It is an ambitious action plan to end poverty, reduce inequality and protect the planet from the ravages of climate change. 
The Government of Canada strongly supports the overarching principle of the 2030 Agenda to \0xECleave no one behind. For Canada, leaving no one behind means that everyone can participate in, contribute to and benefit from the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.
The 2030 Agenda is a transformative agenda, rooted in the principles of inclusiveness, diversity and the need for meaningful international partnerships that deliver positive change for all. It is an agenda that values human dignity and emphasizes fairness and opportunity for everyone.
Diversity extends beyond race and ethnicity. It spans language, gender, religion, sexual orientation, age, individual ability and economic status. Diversity is a proven path to peace and economic prosperity. Canadais own story is proof of that. But in the Canadian experience, that path was neither easy nor perfect. In particular, Canadians recognize that for Indigenous peoples, the Canadian reality is not, and never has been, equitable or fair. 
Everyone should be able to safely drink the water that comes out of their tap. Everyone deserves access to a safe and affordable home. No young person should have to move far from home to get a good, basic education. Yet throughout Canada, these are the disparities faced by Indigenous peoples. 
Indigenous peoples, non-Indigenous Canadians and the Government of Canada agree that the situation has long been untenable and must change. The Government of Canada and Indigenous peoples are forging a new relationship based on recognition of rights, respect, cooperation and partnership. The Government of Canada is developing\0xF3in full partnership with First Nations, Inuit and M\0xC8tis\0xF3a Recognition and Implementation of Rights Framework that will lay the foundation for real and lasting change on issues that matter most. Additionally, the Government of Canada is taking steps to eliminate long-term boil water advisories, improving primary and secondary education on reserve and taking further steps to better align Canadais laws and policies with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.
To succeed in a rapidly changing world, diversity needs to be reflected in the economy. Canadian women are among the best educated in the world; however, they earn 31% less than men on an annual basis. They also earned $0.87 for every dollar earned by men in 2017, based on average hourly earnings. Studies show that by closing the wage gap between women and men, Canadais economic growth would jump significantly. The Government of Canada is leading by example and putting in place measures to address the gender wage gap by shining a light on pay practices in the federally regulated sector and moving forward with a proactive pay equity regime. This robust pay equity regime will cover businesses and organizations operating within the federally regulated sector, applying to around 1.2 million individuals. It will include strong oversight and enforcement, require regular maintenance, and take an innovative approach to ensure that on average, women and men receive the same pay for work of equal value. When women have equal opportunities to succeed, it ensures powerful economic growth and encourages a more inclusive dialogue around the questions that will shape our future. Improving the quality of life for women also contributes to growing healthier families and more vibrant communities.
As Canadians, we all benefit from accessibility when we are all able to fully participate and contribute, barrier-free, to our communities and workplaces as equal participants. This is why the Government of Canada introduced accessibility legislation in June 2018 to help address barriers and strive toward a more accessible Canada by increasing the inclusion and participation of Canadians who may have disabilities or functional limitations.    
Everyone deserves to live free of persecution and discrimination\0xF3no matter who they are or whom they love. Canada is actively promoting human rights related to sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression at home and on the international stage, where Canada is co-chair of the Equal Rights Coalition. The Coalition is the first intergovernmental network formed to promote and protect the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI)1 people around the world. More than 30 countries have joined the coalition since its launch in July 2016.  
We are correcting what needs correcting because fundamentally, every Canadian deserves a fair and equal chance at success. In common with people across the world, Canadians work hard to build a more prosperous future for themselves, their children and their grandchildren. And Canadians are proud of their leadership in building a more just, safer and equitable world for others. 
Canadians understand that quality of life and future economic success are inextricably linked to the commitments we make today to protect the air, earth and water that sustain us. That is why Canada remains steadfast in implementing its commitments made in the Paris Agreement and is driving action on climate, clean energy and oceans. 
We can only eliminate poverty and safeguard our natural environment if the SDGs that we have agreed to become more than lofty words. Human ingenuity, combined with unprecedented development in technology, now gives us the capacity to feed the hungry, educate all children and protect the natural environment.
One nation alone cannot drive the achievement of true and lasting global transformation. Canada can inspire, and lead by example, but to attain these ambitious goals, the world must join hands and work together to achieve our shared ambitions.


1 LGBTI is a common international term. In the Canadian domestic context, however, this report uses the term LGBTQ2 (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and two-spirited). This term includes Indigenous two-spirit identities and is used in Government of Canada titles and documents.
Government of Canadais approach to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development presents a historic opportunity for all countries to work together to take bold and transformative action toward a more resilient and sustainable future. The Government of Canada is working to build a more peaceful, more inclusive, more prosperous and resilient future where no one is left behind. Canada firmly believes that all people should enjoy prosperous and fulfilling lives and be given the same opportunities to succeed. Achieving this vision will require concerted, consistent and balanced efforts to advance all three dimensions of sustainable development: economic, social and environmental. 
Building opportunities for inclusive and sustainable economic growth for all is a priority for the Government of Canada, both at home and abroad. Domestically, the Government is working to ensure that the benefits of a growing economy are enjoyed by an increasing number of Canadians. Canada is committed to an inclusive, people-centred approach to reduce poverty, improve equality of opportunity and strengthen Canadais social safety net. Abroad, the Government of Canada is advancing a progressive trade agenda that seeks to ensure that all segments of society can take advantage of and benefit from the opportunities that flow from trade and investment.
Actions taken to help to build strong, resilient economies and societies must be balanced with measures to protect and conserve our natural environment. Global challenges such as climate change, environmental degradation and unsustainable use of marine resources necessitate greater cooperation among all countries and stakeholders.
The Government of Canadais Federal Sustainable Development Act (2008) provides the legal framework for the development and implementation of the Federal Sustainable Development Strategy (FSDS), which currently facilitates greater transparency and accountability for environmental decision making, and sustainable development planning and reporting within the federal government. It sets out Canadais federal environmental priorities, establishes goals and targets and identifies actions to achieve them. 
The 13 aspirational goals laid out in the FSDS are a Canadian reflection of the environmental SDGs. The goals and targets consider Canadais unique responsibilities: to conserve our vast land area, coastline and oceans, to sustainably develop our natural resources and to protect vulnerable northern regions from climate change impacts.
An inclusive approach to the implementation of the SDGs in Canada needs to broadly span the diversity of Canadian society to truly leave no one behind. That is why Canada is focusing its efforts on putting people at the centre of our decision making and ensuring our policies and programs respond to the distinct challenges faced by under-represented and marginalized groups\0xF3such as women, youth, newcomers to Canada, single parents, seniors, racialized communities, Indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities and LGBTQ2 and nonbinary individuals\0xF3to ensure that everyone can benefit and share in the Canadais economic and social prosperity. 
The Government of Canada is working to renew its relationship with Indigenous peoples, including by moving toward their greater self-government and addressing the socio-economic gaps that exist between Indigenous and nonIndigenous Canadians. 
The Government of Canada believes that achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls at home and around the world is central to realizing transformative social and economic outcomes: it is at the heart of the Government of Canadais approach to implementing the 2030 Agenda. The Government put gender equality at the heart of its mandate by prioritizing actions to increase representation of women at all levels of decision making, increasing womenis economic prosperity and security, addressing gender-based violence and advancing a feminist foreign policy. In June 2017, Canada launched its Feminist International Assistance Policy, which seeks to eradicate poverty and build a more peaceful, more inclusive and more prosperous world. Canada firmly believes that promoting gender equality and empowering women and girls is the most effective way to achieve this goal and drive progress on all SDGs. This is being pursued alongside a progressive trade agenda and a commitment to women, peace and security. 
Coordination structures for implementing the 2030 Agenda
The Government of Canadais current priorities, policies and programming initiatives align well with the SDGs. We are proud that many Canadian priorities, such as growing and strengthening Canadais middle class, reconciliation with Indigenous peoples, advancing gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls, and ensuring access to justice for all Canadians, support Canadais progress toward the 2030 Agenda and its overarching objectives.
The Government of Canada is committed to implementing the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals at home and abroad. As Canadais Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in his address to the UN General Assembly in September 2017, \0xECthe SDGs are as meaningful in Canada as they are everywhere else in the world. The 2018 federal budget reaffirmed 
Canadais commitment to the 2030 Agenda with support for data strengthening, monitoring and reporting and greater coordination to ensure continued progress on our efforts on the SDGs both domestically and internationally.
To meet Canadais commitment, Prime Minister Trudeau mandated the Honourable Jean-Yves Duclos, Minister of Children, Families and Social Development, to lead Canadais implementation of the 2030 Agenda, in collaboration with all other ministers and their departments. This includes responsibility to develop a national strategy through engagement with provinces and territories, municipalities, Indigenous peoples 
and other stakeholders; raising public awareness of the 2030 Agenda and fostering new partnerships and networks to advance the SDGs; and administering a funding program for innovative and horizontal initiatives that support the achievement of the SDGs. 
To support Minister Duclos in this new role, an SDG Unit is being established to coordinate, monitor and report on activities related to the implementation of the national strategy and the funding program. All federal ministers, departments and agencies are accountable for implementing the 2030 Agenda and supporting the development of the national strategy. Departments will examine how their policies and programs contribute to the 2030 Agendais goals and targets, with a view of identifying gaps and areas where action is needed. In addition, a group of seven ministers will help Minister Duclos steward these efforts. They are: the Minister of International Development and La Francophonie; the Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs; the 
Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development; the Minister of Indigenous Services; the Minister of Environment and Climate Change; the 
Minister of Status of Women; and the Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Labour.
The Government of Canada will also continue to work, through Statistics Canada, with the United Nations and Canadian partners on the global SDGindicator framework to help Canada and the world measure progress. In May 2018, the Government of 
Canada launched the new Sustainable Development Goals Data Hub, which will serve as a one-stop online resource with valuable statistics and metrics to track Canadais progress in achieving the 17 SDGs.
Canadian priorities for implementing the 2030 Agenda  
The Government of Canada is working to advance all 17 SDGs, with a particular focus on five key areas to eliminate poverty; advance gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; grow the economy and narrow the socio-economic gaps that exist between different groups; advance self-determination and improve relationships with Indigenous peoples; foster inclusion; and advance action on climate change and clean growth.
Eliminating poverty
Poverty is often a vicious cycle. Though Canada enjoys relative prosperity, 10.6% of Canadians continue to live in poverty. This means that 3.7 million Canadians struggle to make ends meet and satisfy their basic needs, resulting in a lack of access to adequate and nutritious food, lack of access to safe, affordable housing and poorer health outcomes.  
Over 1 million Canadians are working hard but still live in poverty and they lack workplace pension plans and other benefits, predictable schedules to facilitate worknlife balance or opportunities for advancement due to barriers they face in accessing post-secondary education and skills training. 
The Government of Canada is committed to the development of a Poverty Reduction Strategy, so that all Canadians can have a real and fair chance to succeed. The Poverty Reduction Strategy will be long-term and will work to address the multiple dimensions of poverty to ensure that all Canadians can share in Canadais 

prosperity. The Strategy will set targets to reduce poverty, align with existing provincial/territorial and municipal strategies, and include a plan to measure and publicly report on progress.
The Government of Canada has already built a very solid foundation for the Poverty Reduction Strategy through a number of significant investments. 
Lifting children out of poverty is a top priority. Evidence shows that children who grow up in poverty are more likely to remain poor later in life. Recognizing this, the Government of Canada has bolstered benefits for families with children through the new, tax-free Canada Child Benefit. The Canada Child Benefit is helping to lift hundreds of thousands of children out of poverty. It has also improved the quality of life of hundreds of thousands of additional children and families. 
Some Canadians struggle more than others, even with a job. Through the Canada Workers Benefit, beginning in 2019, low-income Canadians will get an added financial boost to the money they take home from work. The Government of Canada is also improving access to this benefit by taking steps to ensure that all eligible workers who file a tax return will receive it. The Government has also begun work on improving the delivery of the Canada Workers Benefit to provide better support to low-income Canadians.
It is important for Canadais seniors to know they have a strong support system in retirement that they can rely on after many years of hard work. The introduction of the Old Age Security pension and the Guaranteed Income Supplement significantly reduced poverty amongst seniors, and the Government of Canada has continued to strengthen it. By restoring the age of eligibility from 67 to 65 for the Old Age Security pension and the 
Guaranteed Income Supplement, 
100,000 future seniors, aged 65 and 66 will be kept out of poverty each year. To help seniors who are living in poverty or most at risk of living in poverty, the Government increased the Guaranteed Income Supplement for the lowest-income single seniors. This increase is helping improve the financial security of close to 900,000 vulnerable seniors and has helped to lift 57,000 seniors out of poverty.
Actions already taken have helped to lift more than half a million Canadians out of income poverty. The 
Government has also made historic, long-term investments in areas such as infrastructure, housing, clean water, health, transportation, and skills and employment that will help to promote sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all.
To help more Canadians find affordable places to call home and to protect those already living in community housing from being displaced, the Government of Canada is implementing a comprehensive National Housing Strategy. It is also making historic investments to create over 100,000 new housing units and repair 300,000 housing units for Canadians. Recognizing that there is an intrinsic link between access to housing and poverty, the Government of Canada is helping to reduce homelessness through Reaching Home, Canadais redesigned homelessness strategy by providing direct support to communities across Canada.
Provinces and territories are also playing a pivotal role in reducing poverty by providing social assistance and delivering social programs and services, including access to postsecondary education and early childhood development programs for low-income Canadians within their jurisdiction. 
While progress is being made to improve the lives of all Canadians, challenges and barriers persist for specific vulnerable and marginalized groups, including Indigenous peoples, single parents (the vast majority of whom are women), persons with disabilities, LGBTQ2 and non-binary persons, newcomers to Canada, seniors and youth.
Feminist International Assistance Policy 

In 2017, Canada launched the Feminist International Assistance Policy, which refocuses Canadais development, humanitarian, and peace and security assistance on helping the poorest and most vulnerable and supporting fragile states. The policy seeks to eradicate poverty and build a more peaceful, more inclusive and more prosperous world. The Government of Canada firmly believes that promoting gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls is the most effective approach to achieving this goal. That is why Canada will ensure that 95% of its bilateral international development assistance will advance gender equality by 2021-2022. 
Canadais international assistance works through six action areas:
1. Gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls (core action area)
2. Human dignity (covering humanitarian action, health and nutrition, and education)
3. Growth that works for everyone
4. Environment and climate action
5. Inclusive governance
6. Peace and security
Canadais international assistance will be directed to areas where it can significantly improve the lives of the poorest and most vulnerable, including those living in fragile states. Canada will ensure that no less than 50% of its bilateral international development assistance is directed to sub-Saharan African countries by 2021-2022. 
Canada has announced several initiatives to advance implementation of the Feminist International Assistance Policy, including $650 million for sexual and reproductive health and rights; $150 million to support local womenis organizations and movements in developing countries through a new Womenis Voice and Leadership Program; and up to $300 million for leveraging new investments and partnership with the private sector, investors and philanthropic organizations to advance gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls in developing countries.   
The Government of Canada recognizes that achieving this objective requires a broad set of policy levers to support Canadians throughout their lives and ensure that Canadians have equal access to the resources, opportunities, education and supports they need to lead a prosperous and fulfilling life. 
Growth that works for everyone
Building a stronger and more inclusive middle class and ensuring that all Canadians have the opportunity to share in the benefits of a strong economy is a top priority for the Government of Canada. Countries are most stable and economies are strongest when everyone has an equal opportunity to participate in, contribute to and benefit from sustainable economic growth. A 
large and financially secure middle class invests in education for their children and can weather unforeseen downturns. An inclusive economy is the kind of economy that Canadians want: one where success can be achieved through hard work and determination regardless of where one starts out in life, where citizens have confidence in the security of their jobs and incomes, and where living standards are continually improving for everyone.
In Canada, post-secondary education and vocational skills training continue to be central to securing decent employment and wages. In the past, however, not all Canadians had equal access to these training opportunities, with individuals from lower-income families having lower rates of participation in postsecondary training. Recognizing that equal opportunity is the foundation of growth that benefits everyone, the Government of Canada has made significant investments to make postsecondary education more accessible and affordable for individuals from low- and middle-income families, including by providing federal student financial assistance and easing access to these benefits for lowerincome families. Canadais efforts in international education have contributed to advancing Canadais Innovation Agenda and Global Skills Strategy.
Even with the best training and career preparation, Canadians will still, from time-to-time, experience bouts of unemployment or displacement from their jobs. The Government of Canada believes that an inclusive economy is one where social supports are in place to mitigate the negative impacts of such events and to support Canadians along their path to their next job or career. Recent reforms to Canadais Employment Insurance 

system have been made to better align it with the realities of todayis labour market, making it more flexible, inclusive and easier to access. Investments are also being made to support Canadians who have been displaced from their job mid-career or who need a second chance to acquire critical skills for the labour market.
The Canada Workers Benefit will also encourage more low-income Canadians to join and remain in the workforce by putting more money in the pockets of lower-income workers transitioning from social safety nets to the workforce. The Government of Canada has also put in place significant measures to boost economic outcomes for women, Indigenous peoples and for persons with disabilities. 
Achieving Canadais vision for a more inclusive and sustainable economy is not possible without investing in core drivers of economic growth. The Government of Canada has increased its investments in innovation, infrastructure and science and technology. Significant and ongoing efforts to reduce poverty, improve equality of opportunity and strengthen income security for all Canadians have set a transformative course for Canadais economy: one that is inclusive and sustainable and considers the security and stability of future generations of Canadians. 
Internationally, \0xECgrowth that works for everyone is one of the six action areas for Canadais Feminist International Assistance Policy, recognizing that inclusive and sustainable economic growth cannot be achieved without the full and equal participation of women as economic actors. When women and girls are given equal opportunities to succeed, they can transform their local economies and generate economic growth that lifts them, their families, communities and countries out of poverty. 
Canada recognizes the importance of the full participation of women in economic decision making and is committed to helping improve opportunities for women through its international assistance, and is:
\0xEF focusing its international assistance on increasing economic leadership and supporting the empowerment of women at all levels;
\0xEF helping to improve economic opportunities for and the resilience of rural women, including through promoting womenis equal access to and control over land, property, natural resources and assets;
\0xEF promoting womenis greater financial inclusion, including equal access to capital, markets, digital technology and business development services; 
\0xEF promoting womenis economic rights and access to decent work; 
\0xEF supporting technical and vocational training for women; and
\0xEF helping to address the disproportionate burden of unpaid work and care shouldered by women and girls.  
Canada is also working with the private sector in developing countries to increase and diversify the range of mechanisms available to support sustainable development. For example, Canadais newly established Development Finance Institute, branded FinDev Canada, will support sustainable development by providing financial services to the private sector in developing countries to reduce poverty through job creation, advance womenis economic empowerment and act on climate change. With an initial capitalization of $300 million, FinDev Canada will focus on three priority, high-impact sectors: green growth, agri-business and financial services for small and medium-sized enterprises. On June 9, 2018, FinDev Canada partnered with other G7 development finance institutions to announce the 2X Challenge, which aims to mobilize US$3 billion by 2020 to support investments in business activities that benefit women in developing countries. 
Reconciliation with Indigenous peoples  
Many Indigenous people do not enjoy the same quality of life as other Canadians, due to the impacts of colonialism compounded by a long history of neglect and failed policies\0xF3 such as the Indian Residential School system. In recognition of this, Prime Minister Trudeau has made reconciliation with Indigenous peoples and the renewal of our nation-tonation relationship his top priority. For the Government of Canada, the realization of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development cannot be achieved without collective action that recognizes and includes the diverse voices and participation of First Nations, Inuit and M\0xC8tis. There is significant alignment between the SDGs and the work of reconciliation\0xF3 centered on closing socio-economic gaps between Indigenous people and non-Indigenous Canadians, advancing self-determination and improving relationships with Indigenous peoples. 
Canada is taking important steps in the work of reconciliation through historic investments. Canada is building on programs for First Nations, Inuit, and M\0xC8tis communities to deliver clean water, housing, child and family services, training and health care, as well as establishing new funding relationships with First Nations intended to secure a better quality of life for Indigenous peoples by moving toward predictable and sustained funding for First Nations communities. Most recently the 2018 federal budget announced $5 billion over five years to support Indigenous communities and peoples by taking further steps to improve the quality of life for Indigenous peoples and to support the recognition and implementation of Indigenous rights.
In acknowledging the recommendations of the 1996 Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, in August 2017 the Government of Canada announced its intention to transform and dismantle old colonial structures by replacing the Department of Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada with two new departments: Indigenous Services Canada, and Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada. 
The new Department of Indigenous Services Canada aims to improve the quality of life for First Nations, Inuit and M\0xC8tis; support the provision of high-quality services; and facilitate a path to self-determination for all Indigenous peoples, allowing them to control service delivery for their respective peoples. 
The new Department of CrownIndigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada will work to accelerate progress on existing rights and recognition mechanisms to identify priorities for individual Indigenous communities; support the efforts of Indigenous peoples to rebuild and reconstitute their nations; and help to enable Indigenous peoples to build capacity that supports implementation of their vision of self-determination.
For too long, Indigenous peoples in Canada have had to prove the existence of their inherent rights and fight to have them recognized and fully implemented. In February 2018, Prime Minister Trudeau announced the Government of Canadais intention to develop a 
Recognition and Implementation of Rights Framework, in full partnership with Indigenous peoples. While the contents of the framework will be determined by a national engagement process currently under way, the Government of Canada believes that as a starting point, the framework should include new legislation and policies that will make the recognition and implementation of rights the basis for all relations between Indigenous peoples and the federal government going forward. 
In this vein, the Government of Canada has launched a review and reform process of its laws, policies and operational practices to help ensure it meets its constitutional obligations with respect to Indigenous and treaty rights, adheres to international human rights standards, including the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and effectively implements the 94 Calls to 
Action of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada.
The Government of Canada is committed to joint priority-setting, co-development of policy and monitoring progress with Indigenous peoples through regular meetings of permanent bilateral mechanisms with the Assembly of First Nations, selfgovernment and land claim agreement holders, the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami and the four Inuit Nunangat regions, and the M\0xC8tis National Council and its governing members. 
Canada is committed to including and amplifying the voices of diverse Indigenous people, including women, youth, elders and two-spirit individuals from across Canada. The 2018 federal budget announced a number of Indigenous-related initiatives that align with the SDGs, such as keeping Indigenous children and families together, making progress to close gaps in Indigenous health outcomes and promoting equal access to training and jobs for Indigenous women. 
In response to calls for action from Indigenous families, communities and organizations, as well as nongovernmental and international organizations, the Government of Canada launched the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls in September 2016.
Composed of four commissioners from across the country, the National Inquiry is independent from federal, provincial and territorial governments, Crown corporations and Indigenous forms of government. The commissionersi mandate is to examine and report on the systemic causes of all forms of violence against Indigenous women, girls and LGBTQ2 and non-binary individuals in Canada by looking at patterns of violence and underlying factors.
Shining a light on all the causes of violence, murders and disappearances is a daunting task, but it is a necessary one. The National Inquiry is looking at the root causes of violence against Indigenous women and girls and the systemic factors such as colonization, racism and sexism. The National Inquiry will result in a set of recommendations aimed at ensuring the safety of Indigenous women, girls and LGBTQ2 and nonbinary individuals.
On June 5, 2018, the Government announced it would provide the Inquiry with an extension to ensure it has time to hear from families and survivors of violence, while balancing the need for it to make timely recommendations on concrete measures to improve the safety of Indigenous women and girls. At the same time, the Government announced new initiatives to respond to the recommendations of the Inquiryis November 2017 report. The Government will provide greater health and victims services supports for families and survivors, establish a commemoration fund to honour the lives and legacies of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, and support efforts to review police policies and practices. 
Moving forward, the Government of Canada will continue to work with Indigenous partners to advance the work of reconciliation and support the development of Indigenous-led solutions, recognizing that a truly renewed relationship cannot be achieved in the span of a few years\0xF3 there is much work that remains to be done. 
Internationally, the Government of Canadais effort to advance the rights of Indigenous peoples are rooted in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples: to promote and protect Indigenous rights, to create prosperity and to foster sustainable development. The Feminist International Assistance Policy takes an intersectional, human-rights based approach to reaching the poorest and most vulnerable, including Indigenous peoples, to better ensure that no one is left behind. Canada is an active participant in a number of multilateral forums working on Indigenous 
issues, such as the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues and the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.
The Government of Canada believes strongly that Indigenous peoples have the right to participate in the decisions that affect them at all levels: before, throughout and after the development and implementation of policies, programs and projects. That is why Canada advocates for meaningful inclusion and enhanced participation of Indigenous peoples in multilateral, regional and national organizations and processes. Canada recognizes that Indigenous peoples are important partners in international development efforts, including in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Canada is committed to seeking the advice of Indigenous partners and organizations and to identifying opportunities to include Indigenous peoples and issues in its international assistance policies and programs. 
As part of Canadais Progressive Trade Agenda, Canada is engaged in ongoing dialogue with Indigenous governments, organizations, associations and communities to enhance the ability of Indigenous peoples and businesses to benefit from the opportunities created by international trade and investment.  
Being mindful of the potential impact of natural resource extraction on Indigenous communities, Canadais approach to promoting responsible business abroad, particularly in the context of the extractive sector, is grounded in the concept of Free Prior and Informed Consent, which promotes meaningful engagement and partnership with Indigenous peoples on issues of concern, with an aim of achieving consensus.
Under the UN Framework 
Convention on Climate Change 
(UNFCCC), Canada is working with Indigenous partners to advance the implementation of a robust local communities and Indigenous peoples platform for exchanging knowledge, experiences and views, building capacity and enhancing their engagement in the UNFCCC.
Gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls
Gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls are key priorities for the Government of Canada. The world cannot leave half of humanity behind and expect to realize sustainable development by 2030. The Government of Canada is committed to advancing its feminist agenda\0xF3both at home and abroad.
Equality between individuals is enshrined in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Canada is committed to upholding gender equality in all sectors of Canadian society.
Canada has made significant progress in many areas that support greater gender equality, such as education and workforce participation; however, women in Canada continue to face challenges in achieving full equality. Women are under-represented in politics and leadership roles, earn less\0xF3on average\0xF3than men and continue to experience high rates of gender-based violence. Certain groups of women and girls face multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination that create disproportionate obstacles to their equality, including Indigenous women and girls, migrant and refugee women and girls, women and girls who live in rural and remote areas, and disabled women and girls. LGBTQ2 and non-binary persons also face similar discrimination and obstacles to the realization and enjoyment of their rights.
Recognizing the significant and important socioeconomic benefits of gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, the Government of Canada has prioritized diversity, inclusion and gender equality. It is estimated that closing several important gender gaps in the labour force could add $150 billion to Canadais GDP in 2026.2  
To tackle existing barriers from all angles, the Government of Canada has focused its efforts on encouraging increased representation of women in all fields and at all levels of decision making, increasing womenis economic security and prosperity, and helping to reduce poverty and eliminate gender-based violence. 
Canada has made it a priority to address the issues of pay equity, invest in womenis entrepreneurship and move the dial on getting more women in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) field. We are also improving the participation of young women and girls in science education and careers, which will enhance the diversity of talented and innovative people who fuel our future.

The Government of Canada is encouraging gender equality, not only at work but also at home. Recognizing the deep connection between child care and economic security, we are working with our provincial and territorial partners to make early learning and child care more flexible, inclusive and affordable across the country, helping families to balance work and family responsibilities and to give more women a choice about participating in the workforce. The Government is providing a new Parental Sharing Benefit that aims to increase gender equality and promote more equal parental roles.
The Government of Canada has strengthened its implementation of Gender-based Analysis Plus (GBA+) to make evidence-based policies and programs that benefit all Canadians. GBA+ also provides the foundation for gender-based budgeting, which will ensure that the impacts of individual budget proposals on different groups of people are understood and will support more effective and inclusive priority setting and decision making. The 2017 and 2018 federal budgets each included a statement examining the gender impact of budget measures.
Building on these efforts, the 
Government introduced the Gender Results Framework in 2018: a wholeof-government tool that identifies Government of Canada objectives in advancing gender equality and the empowerment of women and 
girls domestically and internationally, and allows progress against these objectives to be measured. The Framework supports gender-based budgeting and underpins a wide range of gender equality initiatives. Its six pillars3 represent Canadais top priorities for achieving greater gender equality in Canada and around the world. The gender governance review report of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), released in June 2018, will help identify opportunities to improve Canadais approach to gender budgeting.
Canadais feminist foreign policy seeks to apply a feminist lens across all international policies and programs in trade, security and diplomacy, focussing on addressing systemic barriers to gender equality by supporting women and girls as equal decision makers and by amplifying their voices, promoting and protecting their rights and fostering conditions that enable them to have greater access to and control over productive resources. 
In seeking to meet its goals to eradicate poverty and promote a rights-based approach to international assistance while fostering prosperity, supporting lasting peace and achieving sustainable development, the Government of Canada has prioritized advancing gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls as the most effective way to achieve its desired impact. 
In June 2017, the Government launched a new Feminist International Assistance Policy. The Policy is strategically aligned with the 2030 Agenda. By using SDG 5 as an entry point, the Policy aims to effect progress across all 17 SDGs through six action areas: gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls (core action area); human dignity, including health and nutrition, education, and humanitarian action; growth that works for everyone; environment and climate action; inclusive governance; and peace and security. The Policy also recognizes that engaging men and boys as stakeholders is crucial to achieving gender equality.
In addition, a feminist approach is being developed to other key Government of Canada policies and strategies for international engagement.
Canadais Progressive Trade Agenda seeks to ensure that all segments of society can take advantage of and benefit from the opportunities that flow from trade and investment. While gender equality had been one of 
many elements pursued by Canada during trade negotiations, notably via commitments to non-discrimination in our labour chapters, we are now looking at ways to incorporate more gender considerations in our free trade agreements (FTAs). For instance, in June 2017, Canada finalized its first Trade and Gender chapter in the modernized Canada-Chile FTA and aims to make this a standard practice in all future FTA negotiations. Consequently, the modernized 
Canada-Israel FTA, signed in May 
2018, contains a dedicated Trade and Gender chapter in line with the one in the Canada-Chile FTA. 
Canada is also advancing progressive trade initiatives through enhanced bilateral and multilateral engagement and participation in international economic forums, such as the WTO, G7/20, the OECD and APEC. For instance, Canada recently championed the Joint Declaration on Trade and Womenis Economic Empowerment, which was endorsed by 123 WTO members and observers at the Eleventh Ministerial Conference in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in December 2017. Canada hosted the first seminar organized under the Declaration in Geneva on March 16, 2018.
The Government of Canadais National 

3 The Gender Results Framework pillars are: equal opportunities and diversified paths for education and skills development; full and equal participation in the economy; gender equality in leadership roles and at all levels of decision making; eliminating gender-based violence and harassment and promoting the security of the person and access to justice; reduced poverty and improved health outcomes; promoting gender equality to build a more peaceful, inclusive, rules-based and prosperous world.
Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security guides our development assistance, humanitarian action and peace and security efforts in fragile and conflict-affected states. Launched in November 2017 and supporting the UN Security Council Resolutions on Women, Peace and Security (WPS), the 5-year plan entitled Gender Equality: A Foundation for Peace contains five objectives: 
1. increasing the role of women in conflict prevention and resolution, and post-conflict state- and peacebuilding; 
2. promoting and protecting womenis and girlsi human rights, gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls in fragile, conflict and post-conflict settings; 
3. preventing and responding to sexual and gender-based violence; 
4. meeting the specific needs of women and girls in humanitarian settings; and
5. strengthening the capacity of peace operations to advance the WPS agenda.
The Government of Canada is highly engaged in advancing gender equality and the empowerment of women 
and girls through its participation in bilateral, multilateral and international forums, including: 
\0xEF prioritizing gender equality and womenis empowerment as one of five main themes of Canadais 2018 
G7 presidency, integrated across all 
G7 themes, activities and initiatives. To help inform and enhance this work, Prime Minister Trudeau established the Gender Equality Advisory Council, co-chaired by 
Ambassador Isabelle Hudon and 
Melinda Gates;
\0xEF promoting the advancement of gender equality and women as economic actors, leaders and innovators in international forums, such as the G7, G20, OECD, WTO and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, and including through the G20 Business Women Leaders Taskforce, a Canadian-led initiative agreed to by Leaders at the Hamburg Summit, all of which enable and support the globalization 
of thousands of Canadian womenowned businesses through the Business Women in International 
Trade program; and
\0xEF working to make gender equality, the empowerment of all women and girls, and the realization and enjoyment of their human rights a core priority of the international community, through Canadais broad engagement in the UN system and other international forums, such as the Commonwealth, La Francophonie, the G20 and the OECD. 
Climate, clean energy and oceans
Achieving a more sustainable future requires tackling climate change, improving the health of the worldis oceans and transforming the way we produce, transport and use energy. The interconnected world that we live in requires us to work together to develop truly global solutions. 
Today, the effects of climate change present a real and growing threat, affecting our lives in multiple ways. Responding to these threats requires a global transition from the energy that has powered our societies for generations to energy that comes from clean and non-emitting sources. The pace of that transition may vary from country to country, but it is essential. 
Canada is committed to advancing action on climate change and clean growth, both at home and abroad. The Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change is Canadais comprehensive climate plan that includes a Canada-wide approach to pricing carbon pollution, measures to reduce emissions across all sectors of the economy, actions to build resilience to the impacts 
of a changing climate and efforts to accelerate clean technology, innovation and create good jobs that contribute to strong economic growth.
Through initiatives such as the Low Carbon Economy Fund and the Investing in Canada Plan, the Government of Canada is making historic investments to support implementation of Canadais climate plan, leverage Canadian ingenuity and accelerate clean growth innovation. This includes improving energy efficiency, generating more energy from renewable sources, investing in resilient energy systems and infrastructure, and driving new solutions for the sustainable extraction and use of fossil fuels. 
Climate change is also significantly affecting our oceans and maritime ecosystems. Oceans are a major and growing source of food for the worldis population, a key driver of national and local economies, and an opportunity for new sources of renewable energy. Healthy and resilient oceans can also mitigate the effects of climate change. 
Oceans and ecosystems in Canada and around the world face many challenges, however, including marine pollution, overfishing, the loss and destruction of habitat, acidification and warming temperatures. In particular, marine pollution has become one of the worldis largest environmental problems, while remaining among the least visible. Unprecedented levels of plastics are entering the ocean every year and this is only expected to increase. Globally, plastic waste and marine litter, including micro-plastics, pose a serious threat to the health of our oceans, waterways and well-being. Marine litter and micro-plastics are also found on all of Canadais coasts and in freshwater areas, including the Great Lakes.
Through its 2018 G7 presidency, Canada is exercising leadership to promote sustainable oceans and fisheries and support resilient coasts and coastal communities and to combat marine plastic litter. A key outcome of the G7 Leadersi 
Summit this year is the Charlevoix Blueprint for Healthy Oceans, Seas and Resilient Coastal Communities, which covers substantive actions to support adaptation planning and emergency preparedness; increase financing for coastal resilience; expand earth observation and increase the availability and sharing of ocean science and data; combat illegal, unregulated, and unreported fishing; and expand marine protected areas. Five of the G7 countries also agreed to the Ocean Plastics Charter, which includes ambitious targets to move toward a more resourceefficient and sustainable approach to the management of plastics. Canada will invest $100 million to bolster this initiative.
The Government of Canada has also introduced the Dialogue on Plastic Waste to gather Canadiansi views on plastics and identify ways to achieve zero plastic waste and reduce marine litter. In consultation with Canadians, Indigenous peoples, industry, municipalities, nonprofit organizations and research institutions, the Government will work with provinces and territories to develop an approach to keep plastics within the economy and out of landfills and the environment. The Government will continue to work with its domestic and international partners to create a more circular economy\0xF3one in which we capture and retain the value of plastics rather than seeing them treated as waste.  
The Government of Canada is committed to supporting the poorest and most-vulnerable populations affected by climate change and has committed $2.65 billion in climate finance by 2020-2021 to help developing countries transition to a lower-carbon, climate-resilient economy. Canadais international climate finance sustains a wide range of programs and initiatives that help developing countries manage risks, adapt and build resilience to the impacts of climate change, deploy clean energy technology, and manage natural resources sustainably.
Efforts to combat climate change move to clean energy and protect our oceans also need to incorporate a commitment to womenis empowerment and gender equality. Women and girls in developing countries are disproportionately affected by the adverse impacts of climate change, which exacerbate existing social inequalities and threaten their health, safety and economic well-being. Supporting the leadership of women and girls is critical to achieve meaningful results in climate action, mitigation, disaster reduction and adaptation. Women also face particular barriers to entry into resource-based employment and leadership opportunities. New developments in digitalization and artificial intelligence have the potential to transform energy systems and support the transition to a lowercarbon economy\0xF3all while creating new opportunities for women in the energy sector and helping to build a community of women leaders in the clean energy field.
There are clear opportunities for the climate and SDG agendas to support and strengthen one another. In fostering the conservation and sustainable use of oceans, for example, the SDG framework endorses the need to develop oceanbased solutions for climate change adaptation and mitigation within the framework of the Paris Agreement. Climate change is fast becoming the greatest threat to tackling global poverty, affecting many aspects of development work and worsening existing gender inequality and other injustices. Canada is steadfast in its commitment to work with our global partners to address climate change and all 17 SDGs. We will work collaboratively to leave a cleaner, healthier and more sustainable planet for the generations to come. 

Goal-by-goal actions
SDG 1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere

Eradicating poverty in all its forms remains one of humanityis greatest challenges. Poverty forces individuals to make difficult choices\0xF3often between paying for necessities such as shelter, healthy food, clothing and medication\0xF3and causes 
food insecurity, social exclusion, inadequate housing, lack of access to services and other hardships. Povertyis multidimensional nature means that governments need to respond to both its causes and its consequences by addressing the various deprivations faced by those living in poverty.
The Government of Canada is making short- and long-term investments to improve the economic well-being of all Canadians so they have a real and fair chance to succeed. To achieve this goal, the Government is forming new partnerships, modernizing support mechanisms, encouraging sustainable growth that benefits everyone and\0xF3key to its overall approach\0xF3 developing a Poverty Reduction Strategy that will set targets to reduce poverty and measure and publicly report on our progress. The strategy will align with and support existing provincial and municipal poverty reduction strategies.
In addition, Canadais pathways to pursue this have been outlined in its Feminist International Assistance Policy. It contributes to international poverty eradication efforts by targeting the root causes of poverty: inequality and exclusion.


While Canada is prosperous, not all poverty and unemployment. These Canadians are. The latest data from 
                                       Canadians are eligible for relatively the Canadian Income Survey indicates fewer social protection measures in that the overall rate of low income comparison to families with children was 10.6% in 2016 (Figure 1.1) and seniors, and they may not have based on the Market Basket Measure

SDG 1, but roughly 1 in 10 Canadians continue to live in poverty. 
\0xEF Lone parents, the vast majority of which are women, who continue to face disproportionate rates of poverty along with challenges in balancing work and family life. 
\0xEF Recent immigrants to Canada, who often face language barriers, discrimination, difficulty having their educational and professional credentials recognized, and challenges from a lack of Canadian work experience. 

4 The MBM (available from 2002 onward) is a measure of low income based on the cost of a specific basket of goods and services representing a modest, basic standard of living. It includes the costs of food, clothing, footwear, transportation, shelter and other expenses for a reference family of two adults (aged 25-49) and two children (aged 9 and 13). It provides thresholds for a finer geographic level than other low-income measures used in Canada, allowing, for example, different costs for rural areas in the different provinces. These thresholds are compared to disposable income of families to determine low-income status.

communities. Social exclusion based on racism, lack of equity in funding, disproportionate presence in the justice system and food insecurity in remote communities are some of the key issues affecting Indigenous peoples that speak to persistent gaps in meeting their needs through Canadais social protection system. While low-income data is currently not available for Indigenous people who live on reserves, both living conditions and statistics on educational and employment outcomes suggest that the poverty rate on reserve is higher than off reserve.
\0xEF Persons with disabilities, who face barriers that increase their risk of living in poverty, with some facing barriers so severe that they cannot work. For people with severe disabilities with no attachment to the work force, income support from most provincial social assistance systems is below low-income lines, indicating a gap in social protection that can leave some Canadians to face poverty as a direct result of their work-limiting disability. Persons with developmental disabilities face unique barriers to social integration 
despite being willing and capable of participating in an urban life and the labour market.
Canadais overall low-income rate is similar for women and men, with important disparities. Women comprise 60% of single, low-income seniors. One in 3 single mothers are poor, which negatively affects their childrenis health and outcomes in school, and often leads to lasting effects across generations. This is particularly true for Indigenous women, who are more likely to be single mothers. 
Official low-income data on the LGBTQ2 community is not available, but we know LGBTQ2 individuals face discrimination in Canada and some, particularly youth, are especially vulnerable to poverty and its hardships5. 
Some groups have seen improvements. Canadian seniors, partially due to programs such as the Guaranteed Income Supplement, the 
Old Age Security Program and the Canada Pension Program, no longer face disproportionate rates of poverty; 
single seniors do, however, remain 
vulnerable to poverty. Low-income rates for single parent families have also declined since 2002 based on the MBM, with the 2016 rate being one of the lowest rates observed so far with this measure. Nevertheless, lone parents\0xF3and especially female lone parents\0xF3remain among the groups currently most affected by disproportionate low-income rates. Multiple dimensions of poverty
Safe, adequate and affordable housing is vital to oneis well-being. About 1.7 million families\0xF312.7% of Canadians\0xF3were in housing need, living in homes that are inadequate or unaffordable in 2016 (similar to annual rates in the last decade). Particularly affected are single mothers and elderly women, and women living in the North or in Indigenous households. Domestic violence is another key contributor to womenis housing instability.
Approximately 27,000 Canadians were chronically homeless in 2016. Indigenous peoples are overrepresented among the homeless in many Canadian cities. LGBTQ2 youth are also at higher risk of homelessness due to homophobia and transphobia in the home.
Poverty and health are closely connected. Poverty in Canada is associated with shorter life expectancy and higher rates of chronic diseases, certain cancers, stress and mental health problems. Low-income individuals are less likely to have access to nutritious food, adequate housing and safe working conditions, and are more likely to have unmet health-care needs.
Regarding access to affordable and nutritious food, 8.3% of Canadian 


5 Canada has announced new funding to create a new Centre for Gender, Diversity and Inclusion Statistics, which will aim to address data gaps in the availability of disaggregated data on gender, race and other intersecting identities.
Figure 1.3 Percentage of Canadian households in moderate or severe f ood insecurity, Canada, 2007-2008 and 2011-2012


households reported moderate or severe food insecurity in 2011-2012 (Figure 1.3). Food insecurity is more prevalent among households with children, which leaves a significant mark on their well-being. Across Canada, northern and remote locations generally experience much higher rates of food insecurity than elsewhere.
Literacy and numeracy rates suggest that some Canadians may not have sufficient basic skills to fully benefit from socio-economic opportunities. Although currently at historic lows, nearly 1 in 10 Canadian youth were not pursuing employment, education or training in 2017 with males being more prevalent among this group\0xF3 putting them at risk of entering a cycle of poverty.
Rising to the challenge 
Canadians have long been ambitious about reducing poverty. The Government of Canada has a strong social safety net to support Canadians through difficult times, such as job loss or illness. At its core, however, the best protection against poverty is having a job. That is why the Government has invested in the social and economic fabric in order to support Canadians by empowering them to thrive and join the middle class. 
To further ensure that all Canadian can contribute to and share in Canadais prosperity, the Government of Canada intends to shortly release its first national Poverty Reduction Strategy, which will set a bold vision for Canada as a world leader in the eradication of poverty.
The Strategy sets targets to reduce poverty and measure and publicly report on progress. The Strategy will align with existing provincial and municipal poverty reduction strategies. The Government of 
City of Toronto 
In 2015, the Toronto City Council adopted a 20-year poverty reduction strategy with 17 recommendations to help provide a safety net to prevent people from falling into poverty and a lifeline to help lift people out. Actions to implement the strategy are spread throughout the city, focus on under-served areas and aim to address a full range of target groups, including children and youth, seniors and single parents. 
The goal of this work is to create an opportunity for everyone to share in the prosperity of Toronto. The strategy focuses on housing stability, services access, transit equity, food security, the quality of jobs and incomes, and systemic change.
Canada has consulted with provincial, territorial and municipal partners, First Nations, Inuit and M\0xC8tis, community organizations, poverty experts, the business community and those who have experienced poverty.
Since 2015, Canada has focused on growth that benefits everyone, investing in reducing poverty from coast to coast to coast. Some of these investments, like the taxfree Canada Child Benefit (CCB), are having an immediate impact in reducing poverty and making a difference in the lives of hundreds of thousands of Canadians by bolstering benefits to families with children. Other investments, such as Early Learning and Child Care, the 
National Housing Strategy, public transit infrastructure and home care and mental health, are laying the foundation for changing lives of Canadians in the years to come.
When women have more opportunities to work and earn a good living, everyone benefits. Access to affordable child care is a key factor in encouraging women back into the workforce. To help Canadian children get the best start in life and better support Canadian families, 
Canada has announced major new investments to support and create more high-quality, affordable child care across the country, particularly for families more in need through early learning and child-care agreements. In 2017, the Government of Canada also announced a historic agreement with provincial and territorial governments: the Multilateral Early Learning and Child Care Framework. The Framework will seek to increase the quality, accessibility, affordability, flexibility and inclusivity in early learning and child care, in particular for families that need child care the most. 
There are over one million working Canadians living in poverty. Through the Canadian Workers Benefit (CWB), beginning in 2019 lowincome Canadians will get an added financial boost to the money they take home from work. The Government of Canada is improving access by taking steps to ensure that all eligible workers who file a tax return will receive the benefit. The Government has also begun work on improving the delivery of the CWB to provide better support to low-income Canadians throughout the year rather, than through an annual refund after they file their taxes. Extra support at this crucial stage of life helps children and families meet their basic needs but it also goes further: it gives a boost to low- and modest-income families to help them join the middle class, and it is helping keep middle-class families out of poverty should they face a setback.
It is important for Canadais seniors to know they have a strong support system in retirement that they can rely on after many years of hard work. The introduction of the Old Age Security pension and the Guaranteed Income Supplement significantly reduced poverty among seniors, and the Government has continued to strengthen it. By restoring the age of eligibility from 67 to 65 for some of these programs, 100,000 seniors, aged 65 and 66 will be kept out of poverty each year. To help seniors who are living in poverty or most at risk of living in poverty, the Government increased the Guaranteed Income Supplement for the lowest-income single seniors. This annual increase is helping improve the financial security of 900,000 seniors, and has lifted 57,000 seniors out of poverty.
The Government also continues to make improvements in the delivery of Old Age Security and the Guaranteed Income Supplement so that more eligible seniors receive benefits. This includes automatically enrolling new Old Age Security beneficiaries who qualify for the Guaranteed Income Supplement, making available an integrated benefits application, starting in 2018, and outreach activities to increase takeup of benefits for those who qualify. Activities to increase take-up have resulted in over 95,000 additional seniors receiving or about to receive the Guaranteed Income Supplement. This is an added boost for lowincome seniors who need the support the most. 
Beyond benefits for Canadais seniors, the Government is also working to ensure that Canadians, particularly those with low income, are able to access the benefits to which they are entitled. Through the Community Volunteer Income Tax Program (CVITP), community organizations host free tax preparation clinics, where volunteers complete tax returns for Canadians with low income and a simple tax situation. This program targets groups disproportionally affected by poverty in Canada, such as Indigenous people, persons with disabilities, and recent immigrants. In 2018-2019, the Government will double the size of the program to ensure that more Canadians in need can access clinics throughout the year. This work is complemented by the steps the Government is taking to increase take-up of the Canada Child Benefit for First Nations people living on reserve. 
Canada is also making historic, longterm investment in Canadais first-ever National Housing Strategy, because every Canadian should have a place to call home. With investments of $40 billion over 10 years in housing, the Strategy sets a vision to help Canadians have access to housing that meets their needs and that they can afford. Over the next 10 years, these historic investments in housing aim to reduce or eliminate the housing need for 530,000 households, protect 385,000 community housing units and create another 50,000 units through the expansion of community housing in Canada. In addition, the Government will support the successful implementation of specific housing strategies for First Nations, Inuit and M\0xC8tis.
As part of the National Housing Strategy, the Government announced a total investment of $2.2 billion over 10 years to tackle homelessness through an expanded federal homelessness program. A redesigned federal homelessness program, Reaching Home: Canadais Homelessness Strategy, will officially launch on April 1, 2019. The program will bolster community efforts to tackle homelessness, including by adopting an outcomes-based approach and enabling communities to generate more comprehensive data on their local homeless population. Together with other National Housing Strategy initiatives, this modernized federal homelessness program aims to reduce chronic homelessness by 50% over the next 13 years.  
Public infrastructure is critical in both helping Canadians meet their basic needs and having the opportunity to succeed. That is why the Government of Canada has invested in infrastructure that will benefit Canadians for years to come. Investments in public transit will help low-income Canadians more efficiently navigate busy lives, from getting to work, to bringing a family member to a doctoris appointment, to getting kids to school on time and will ensure public transit is safe and accessible for all Canadians. These investments go beyond just helping Canadians make ends meet; they are helping families spend less time travelling to jobs and school, and more time succeeding in work, education and in many other areas. 
Canadais infrastructure investments also include community and cultural spaces. Public spaces like community centres, urban parks and libraries can be a valued resource in the lives of low-income Canadians. Community centres and urban parks are a source of information and a place where children can go to play and build friendships that can last a lifetime. Libraries offer a breadth of resources to help parents find books to read to their children, apply for jobs and attend free information sessions on a variety of topics such as training programs and nutrition. Taken together, these investments are giving Canadians the public spaces to help them reach their full potential. 
The Government has also taken leadership in engaging with provinces and territories to address key health care priorities. In particular, the Government has made substantial investments over 10 years to provinces and territories, specifically targeted to improve home care and mental health services. 
Supporting First Nations, Inuit and M\0xC8tis communities
Canada is committed to reconciliation with Indigenous peoples and to a renewed relationship based on the recognition of rights, respect, cooperation and partnership. No relationship is more important than the relationship with Indigenous peoples.
Certain barriers and challenges are unique to or greater for Indigenous peoples, and may be even more pronounced for those Indigenous peoples who are living in northern or remote communities, women, LGBTQ2 and those with disabilities or functional limitations.
Indigenous children and families face specific barriers to overcoming acute poverty, including failed government policies, the continued impact of Canadais colonial history, effects of trauma from the Indian Residential School system and discrimination in certain settings. Closing socioeconomic gaps requires a holistic approach and a strategy that balances long-term transformative changes with immediate actions to address 
the most pressing gaps. To improve overall well-being, actions must reflect a renewed, nation-to-nation relationship with Indigenous peoples based on respect, cooperation, partnership and recognition of rights.
The Government of Canada is committed to improving Indigenous socio-economic conditions and help address some of povertyis root causes, including:
\0xEF Co-developing, with Indigenous partners, a separate Indigenous Framework on Early Learning and Child Care that reflects the unique cultures and needs of First Nations, Inuit and M\0xC8tis children and families;
\0xEF Providing dedicated funding to support the successful implementation of a First Nations Housing Strategy, an Inuit-led housing plan and a M\0xC8tis Nationis housing strategy;
\0xEF Providing substantial, long-term investment in a new Indigenous Skills and Employment Training 
Program to help approximately 15,000 people gain greater skills and find jobs for long-term career success;
\0xEF Providing funding, for 3 years starting in 2018, to reduce service barriers and ensure access to all social benefits for Indigenous peoples in reserve, remote and northern communities; and, 
\0xEF Improving access to clean and safe drinking water for First Nations living on reserve, which is also a priority for Canada and new funding has been announced toward this goal.
Canada will continue to work in partnership with Indigenous groups to realize a Canada where we achieve meaningful reconciliation with First Nations, Inuit and M\0xC8tis. As part of Canadais Poverty Reduction Strategy, this will mean recognizing the unique experience of poverty among Indigenous people, supporting autonomy and empowerment, and building on investments to date that take a distinctions-based approach, where programming is designed with and for Indigenous people.
Engagement
Tackling poverty is a shared responsibility; the Government of Canada does not act alone. The Government works closely with provinces, territories and municipalities, and will continue to forge strong bonds with stakeholders, charities and community groups on the frontlines of tackling poverty in communities across Canada.
There are many investments and initiatives at the provincial and territorial level in Canada. Provincial and territorial governments are responsible for delivering their social programs and providing income support to low-income working age individuals through their social assistance programs. Many provinces have poverty reduction strategies: Quebec was the first province to release a strategy (in 2002) and Saskatchewan, the most recent (in 
2016). In keeping with their Poverty Reduction Strategy Act, the Province of Manitoba recently conducted public consultations to review and update their strategy. The results are anticipated to be released in 2018. Some municipalities (e.g. Calgary, Edmonton, Saint John, Toronto) also have poverty reduction strategies. 
Recently the provinces of Alberta, British Columbia and Ontario have either increased or announced their intent to increase their provincial minimum wage rate to $15 an hour. This will help many Canadians who experience poverty despite working. 
The Province of Ontario is currently conducting a pilot project to study the impact of basic income in three specific pilot locations (launched in 2017). As part of this project, a group of eligible applicants are receiving monthly basic income payments (regardless of employment status) for up to 3 years. Results of this project will be analysed and reported after its completion. 
Municipal action on poverty reduction 

From coast to coast, municipalities across Canada have taken action to tackle poverty. With their front-line prospective, municipalities have a unique role to play on the issues affecting their communities and the ability to implement innovative solutions at the local level. They are also filling gaps and complementing essential federal, provincial and territorial leadership on income support, housing, mental health, education and skills training.

The Province of Quebec has recently announced a guaranteed income policy for long-term social assistance recipients with a severely limited capacity for employment. Under this policy, persons in Quebec who have a severely limited capacity for employment and have received social assistance in 66 of the past 72 months are projected to have disposable incomes matching or surpassing the MBM line by 2023.
Canada and the world
Global poverty has declined dramatically in the last three decades. Nevertheless, hundreds of millions of people still live in poverty with limited access to resources and opportunities. Half of the worldis extreme poor live in sub-Saharan Africa. Many are women and girls. An increasing proportion of the worldis poorest citizens live in countries and regions that are deemed \0xECfragile due to the risks of violent conflict, climate and environmental hazards, or economic and political instability. 
Canadais Official Development Assistance Accountability Act requires that Canadian Official Development Assistance have a central focus on poverty reduction. To ensure that local needs are met effectively and that the perspectives of the poor are considered, Canada engages with partner governments, civil society organizations and project participants throughout the lifecycle of its international assistance projects and programs.
In June 2017, Canada announced the Feminist International Assistance Policy. The new policy represents a significant shift in Canadais international assistance. It is the result of extensive consultations with Canadian and international partners and stakeholders and is built on a foundation of evidence and best practices. 15,000 participants from 65 countries contributed many concrete ideas and suggestions that are reflected in the policy. The Policy also embodies Canadais commitments to international frameworks such as the 2030 Agenda, the Paris Agreement on climate change and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on development financing. 
The Feminist International Assistance Policy provides the guiding framework for Canadais international assistance and addresses the root causes of poverty: inequality and exclusion. The Policy seeks to eradicate poverty and build a more peaceful, more inclusive and more prosperous world. Canada firmly believes that promoting gender equality and empowering women and girls is the most effective approach to achieving this goal. Canada is committed to providing feminist international assistance that is human rights-based and inclusive, strategic and focused, transformative and activist, and evidence-based and accountable.
Canadais international assistance efforts will focus on 6 action areas:
1. Gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls (core action area)
2. Human dignity (including humanitarian action, health and nutrition, and education)
3. Growth that works for everyone
4. Environment and climate action
5. Inclusive governance
6. Peace and security
Canadais international assistance will be directed to areas where it can significantly improve the lives of the poorest and most vulnerable, including those living in fragile states. To support the implementation of the Policy, Canadais 2018 federal budget announced $2 billion in new resources for international assistance over the next 5 years.
In addition, Canada has announced several new initiatives to support the Feminist International Assistance Policy, including:
\0xEF $650 million to support access to the full range of sexual and reproductive health services and information, including to prevent and respond to sexual and genderbased violence;
\0xEF $150 million over 5 years to support local womenis organizations and movements in developing countries; and 
\0xEF Up to $300 million toward expanding innovative partnerships and leveraging additional funding from the private sector, investors and philanthropic organizations to support the advancement of gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls in developing countries.
Working with multilateral partners, Canada will draw on its membership in key multilateral groups\0xF3including the United Nations, G7, G20, Commonwealth, La Francophonie and others\0xF3to champion gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls.
Canada is also committed to improving the effectiveness of its international assistance and to becoming more transparent in its results and activities. Canada will use its assistance to mobilize additional resources for sustainable development, including through building new multi-stakeholder partnerships. 
To improve the effectiveness of its international assistance, Canada is also committed to investing in innovation and research, which are critical to evidence-based policymaking and to supporting poverty reduction efforts around the world. 
Canada invests in science and research in Canada and globally, including in the Global South. Canadais International Development Research Centre (IDRC), for example, is world-renowned for its extensive global networks and scaling-up of innovations that play a critical role in solving real-world challenges. For example, IDRCis Canadian 
International Food Security Research Fund has piloted 144 innovations, of which 37 are being scaled up, benefitting over 300,000 small-scale farmers in 24 countries to date.
Next steps
\0xEF Canadais first national Poverty Reduction Strategy, to be released in 2018, is guided by the Governmentis commitment to make real, positive change in the lives of Canadians now and into the future. The Strategy will set targets to reduce poverty and measure and publicly report on our progress. The Strategy will also align with and support existing provincial and municipal poverty reduction strategies.
\0xEF Looking ahead, the Government has already announced further efforts to support poverty reduction, including plans to: 
- develop a national food policy; 
- create an advisory council to move toward implementing a national \0xECpharmacare program; 
- work with stakeholders to develop a social innovation and social finance strategy to better support community organizations working to address persistent social problems using innovative approaches; and 
- make a more fair and inclusive society through upcoming pay equity legislation and accessibility legislation. 
\0xEF The Government has also already started on the path to reconciliation and is committed to continuing to work in partnership with Indigenous peoples to reduce poverty and improve well-being. 
\0xEF Canada will continue to leverage its diplomatic, trade and international assistance efforts to support global poverty eradication. These initiatives will continue to be aligned with and support the 2030 Agenda.

Goal-by-goal actions
SDG 2: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable 

agriculture
As the worldis population continues to grow, one of our greatest challenges will be to ensure food security for all. Hunger and food insecurity remain a pressing problem, with significant negative consequences on the development potential of and quality of life in many countries.
Although most of the worldis food-insecure populations are in developing countries, all countries face unique food security challenges. In Canada, food insecurity cuts across demographics and geography, and domestic action is required for Canada to address the specific challenges faced by its more vulnerable populations, including its northernmost and Indigenous communities. 
Food security is of paramount concern to federal, provincial and territorial governments in Canada. 
Canadais approach to sustainable food production and food security are areas of shared responsibility between federal departments, provincial, territorial and municipal governments, industry stakeholders and communities.
While the federal government has a leadership role in developing Canadian policies and program strategies that support domestic food security, provinces and territories operate their own programs to improve access to food within their jurisdictions. Ultimately, effectively addressing food insecurity and eliminating hunger in Canada will require collaboration between all levels of government as well as with partners, including non-governmental organizations, industry, Indigenous peoples and communities.  

Leaving no one behind
Canada monitors food security through diverse mechanisms. The Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) offers some of the more comprehensive cross-sectional data sets related to health status, health-care utilization and health determinants for the Canadian population at the sub-provincial level. The CCHS also monitors the prevalence of income-related household food insecurity, which, given the strong link between income and food security, makes the CCHS one of Canadais key tools in monitoring domestic food insecurity.
The most recent CCHS data for all provinces and territories suggest that between 2011 and 2012, 91.6% of Canadian households were food secure. Food-secure households are those that gave no indication of any income-related barrier to food access. During that period, however, 8.4% of Canadian households\0xF3representing more than 2 million people aged 12 and older\0xF3reported experiencing income-related food insecurity. These households were classified as either moderately or severely food insecure.
Food security emerged as a key theme in the consultations to inform a 
Canadian Poverty Reduction Strategy. 
Canadians highlighted the importance of quality nutrition for children facing poverty across the country. Food security was a key concern among First Nations, Inuit and M\0xC8tis participants, in particular. They said that the high prices of, and limited access to, nutritious food in many communities, particularly in northern, isolated areas, are major issues.
Canada is actively working to identify communities where food insecurity is an issue. Children, racialized communities and Indigenous peoples all experience higher levels of food insecurity on average than the rest of the Canadian population. For example, 1 in 5 Nunavut households report being in a state of severe food insecurity, with adults and/or children reducing their food intake or skipping meals entirely on a regular basis.
The Government of Canada supports a suite of multi-faceted programs that target vulnerable populations. These programs aim to provide financial assistance to promote healthy behaviours and coping skills through activities that include nutrition education, food assistance, breastfeeding promotion and support, collective food preparation and food budgeting. While programming is available to broadly support communities in addressing food insecurity, a concerted effort has been made to support initiatives that focus action on areas where the need is the most acute. The Nutrition North Canada (NNC) Program was launched in 2011 to support bringing healthy food to isolated northern communities. NNC works with stores across the 
North and food suppliers in southern Canada to help make perishable, nutritious food more affordable and more accessible in remote, isolated communities in the North.
The Aboriginal Head Start in Urban and Northern Communities Program has been active since 1995 and annually provides between 4600 and 4800 children, in 134 urban and northern communities, with programming that fosters Indigenous culture and language, education and school readiness, health promotion, nutrition, social support and parental involvement.
Similarly, the Aboriginal Head Start on Reserve Program, implemented in 1998, supports over 14,000 First Nations children on reserve to foster education, health promotion, culture and language, nutrition, social support and parental/family involvement.
Since 1993, the Community Action Program for Children has funded approximately 415 projects in over 3,000 communities. The projects provide more than 223,000 vulnerable children and parents/caregivers with health and development activities, parenting skills programs, nutritional support and collective kitchens, physical activity programs, outreach and home visits.

These regions collectively encompass the area traditionally occupied by Inuit in Canada. (Source: http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhsenm/2011/ref/dict/pop149-eng.cfm)
Rising to the challenge
In addition to providing targeted programming at the community level and funding to support the economic well-being of Canadians, the federal government is working with provinces and territories, Indigenous peoples, civil society and industry to develop a Food Policy for Canada. The Policy will set a long-term vision for health, environment, social and economic goals related to food, while identifying actions to be taken in the short term. 
Food availability is an obvious and important factor related to reducing food insecurity. One element in ensuring sufficient quantities of safe and nutritious food is a 

commitment to investments that support productive capacity and efficient distribution and utilization of food. Canada undertakes actions to increase agricultural production by supporting sustainable resource management, investing in the research capacity of stakeholders, encouraging investment in targeted communities and regions, and advancing actions that focus on increasing labour availability. 
Canada has a number of initiatives designed to support sustainable food production systems and enable the implementation of resilient agricultural practices. These initiatives include research by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) and cost-shared programming between federal and provincial/territorial governments that support environmentally beneficial management practices for agricultural landscapes. 
For example, AAFCis AgroEcosystem Resilience Strategy guides departmental investments into soil, water, air, climate and biodiversity research to ensure longterm protection of these resources while maximizing the resilience of agricultural lands to future climate scenarios. The Agricultural Clean Technology Strategy guides AAFC investments into developing and promoting technologies, such as precision agriculture, which helps farmers mitigate their impact on the environment. Supporting farmers and protecting farmland are important to the continued growth and sustainability of Canadais agricultural sector.
Canada invests in a variety of measures that aim to address climate change and related hazards. One measure is the development of new crop strains and varieties to resist 
Fertilizer Canada 
Fertilizer Canada, an industry association representing manufacturers, wholesale and retail distributors, recognizes that a sustainable agriculture industry is critical to meeting the SDGs. The organization is heavily invested in the 4R Nutrient Stewardship Framework for management of crop nutrients: the right source, rate, time and place. Global food security cannot be achieved without the use of commercial fertilizers, so Fertilizer Canada is involved in a variety of partnerships that are committed to implementing the Framework. With the use of this standardized, science-based framework, industry stakeholders can ensure that food is sustainably produced and farmers can increase yields and produce abundant and quality food.
novel climate-related pests and diseases, as well as strains that are hardier to various climate-related stressors.
Investments in soil and water management help ensure resilience against weather extremes resulting in too much or too little water. Canadais Drought Watch initiative, for example, allows farmers to access accurate and up-to-date soil water moisture information and predictive tools to optimally manage their growing and harvesting operations.
Engagement
Strategies to support resilient food production and distribution require significant collaboration and communication between partners. 
For example, the Government of Canada is undertaking significant efforts to engage Indigenous peoples in the development of policies and programs related to food security.  Recognizing the vital perspective of Indigenous peoples in the creation of A Food Policy for Canada, the Government of Canada made efforts to ensure Indigenous representation in various forums supporting the development of the Policy and provided targeted support to enable national Indigenous organizations to engage their members in a way that was culturally appropriate.
Another example of collaboration with partners is the Canadian Agricultural Partnership (CAP), which launched on April 1, 2018. CAP is a 5-year, $3 billion federal, provincial and territorial investment in Canadais agriculture, agri-food and agri-based products sector. This initiative will help to ensure the sectoris continued innovation, growth and prosperity.  
CAP will enhance collaboration and competitiveness of the sector by augmenting its science and innovation capacity, encouraging adoption of innovative products and practices, and emphasizing sustainable and clean growth. The Government of Canada will help support the resilience and sustainability of the sector by helping farmers adapt to climate change, conserve water and soil resources and grow their businesses to meet increasing global food demand sustainably.
SDG  2: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture
In Canada, sector-specific round tables are effective mechanisms in bringing together federal, provincial and territorial policy makers and industry leaders. These round tables help set priorities and longterm strategies. One such example is the Canadian Roundtable for Sustainable Crops (CRSC), a federally funded, member-based organization that facilitates crosscommodity collaboration on sustainable agriculture issues and opportunities facing grain sector participants. Composed of grower, industry, customer and environmental organizations, the CRSC is a national, industry-led forum developing and showcasing Canadais grains sustainability performance.
Canada and the world
Internationally, Canada is working with a broad range of partners to ensure food security and nutrition for the worldis poorest and mostvulnerable people, to build capacity for sustainable agricultural practices and to support and protect the planetis biodiversity. Canada supports the UN Convention to Combat Desertification and identifies priority areas for research that will increase knowledge of the factors contributing to, and the impacts of, desertification and drought. Canada also supports biodiversity through its commitment to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity and cooperates in conservation activities at the global level, in particular with the Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, led by the UNis Food and Agriculture Organization. 
30
In 2015, Canada provided $489 million in international assistance to support agriculture, fishing, food security and nutrition. In the same year, Global Affairs Canada disbursed $1.8 billion in support of nutrition-specific programming and multi-sectoral interventions, including agriculture, health and social protection.
Canadais Feminist International Assistance Policy recognizes that fair access to resources for women farmers reduces the number of families and children suffering from chronic hunger. Almost 80% of women in least-developed countries list agriculture as their primary economic activity; however, they represent less than 20% of landowners and often receive little return for their agricultural output. 
Canadais international assistance aims to improve womenis incomes and productivity through greater adoption of climate-smart methods of food production. This includes supporting local woman-led agricultural businesses, including local womenis cooperatives and associations, which are best-placed to support food security and economic sustainability at the local level. 
For example, in collaboration with an agricultural producersi union, the Union des producteurs agricolesd\0xC8veloppement international, Canada is working to improve food security for 790,000 persons\0xF3including 400,000 women\0xF3in the rural areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti and Senegal by strengthening the capacity of small farming business organizations, as well as the capacity of their members to ensure sustainable agricultural development.
Due to the intersection of food insecurity and discriminatory social and cultural practices, women and girls are disproportionately affected by malnutrition. This results in a greater likelihood of anemia, which decreases their productivity and earning potential, and increases their risk of death during childbirth and poor birth outcomes.
Canadian assistance makes it easier for women, girls and all young children to access nutritious foods and supplements. Canada uses its leadership in the Scaling Up Nutrition movement to advance greater coherence in health and nutrition interventions, as well as advancing gender equality and the empowerment of women and 
girls, with a particular emphasis on adolescent nutrition. 
Canadais humanitarian food assistance is provided through trusted and experienced UN and NGO partners, based on identified needs, and contributes to its humanitarian assistance objectives of saving lives, maintaining human dignity and alleviating suffering. Canada recognizes that humanitarian crises and food insecurity affect men, women, boys and girls differently. As such, Canada is committed to working with its partners to integrate gender considerations into humanitarian assistance to ensure specific needs are met and that women and girls have a voice in humanitarian response. 
As a  party to the Food Assistance Convention, Canada adheres to the principles of providing food assistance that seeks to improve the effectiveness, efficiency and quality of food assistance provided to the worldis most-vulnerable populations. Since 2013, Canada has consistently exceeded its minimum annual commitment of $250 million in food assistance.  
Canada is also a long-standing supporter of school meals programming, having provided flexible, predictable support to the UN World Food Programme to implement school meals programs since 2003.  
Next steps
Eliminating hunger and malnutrition in the world is a monumental yet achievable task. It is a task requiring that countries look within\0xF3to better identify and support mechanisms to reduce food insecurity in their own jurisdictions\0xF3as well as enable knowledge transfer and support for food security initiatives in other countries. 
Canada will continue to work domestically to:
\0xEF Implement comprehensive strategies and programming that will support the sustainable production of agriculture within Canada;
\0xEF Target programming to enhance food security within communities that are currently food insecure; and 
\0xEF Collaborate with Indigenous peoples to close food insecurity gaps and other socioeconomic gaps between Indigenous and nonIndigenous Canadians.
Canada will also continue to work with international partners, including developing countries, to tackle hunger, support food security and improve sustainability of agriculture worldwide.
In line with its World Humanitarian Summit and Grand Bargain commitments, Canada is:
\0xEF Shifting its humanitarian funding from a year-on-year model to a multi-year response, where appropriate, such as in protracted crises; 
\0xEF Providing cash-based food assistance to increase the quality and effectiveness of comprehensive humanitarian responses; and 
\0xEF Piloting an innovative joint initiative with the UN Rome-based agencies, which are mandated to eliminate hunger to increase the resilience of populations affected by protracted emergencies.   

Goal-by-goal actions
SDG 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all 

ages
Health is a key driver of sustainable development. Good physical and mental health is essential for individual well-being, supports gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, enables inclusive and sustainable growth and efficient labour markets, and enables robust community participation and engagement. By achieving good health for all, societies can be more peaceful, more inclusive and more prosperous. 
Canada is committed to fulfilling the right of everyone to enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, in line with the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Canada recognizes that fulfilling this right depends on realizing its other human rights commitments, including ensuring freedom from all forms of discrimination and protecting the most vulnerable.
The Government of Canada works 
with provincial and territorial partners on measures to improve access to health services and address the health determinants associated with attaining and maintaining the physical and mental well-being of all Canadians. In addition, Veterans Affairs Canada has developed a Well-being Framework to provide ongoing, systematic assessment and to measure veteransi well-being.
Canadais predominantly publicly financed and administered healthcare system is designed to ensure that all eligible residents have no-cost access to hospital and physician services. This system is governed by the principles of public administration, comprehensiveness, universality and accessibility, and reflects the underlying Canadian values of equity and solidarity. While the provinces and territories lead in the design and delivery of health care and health services, the federal government 

ensures a national standard is maintained through the Canada Health Act and provides long-term predictable funding through the Canada Health Transfer.
Leaving no one behind
Canada recognizes the importance of identifying and eliminating inequalities in health outcomes. Health inequalities, in Canada as elsewhere, are frequently associated with social determinants of health, that is, those factors outside of the health-care system that affect health, including income and social status, employment, education, childhood experiences, race, ethnicity, gender and culture.
The Pan-Canadian Health Inequalities Reporting Initiative strengthens understanding of health inequalities and their main drivers in Canada. One of its key products, the interactive Health Inequalities Data Tool, was launched in 2017. The Data Tool contains inequality results for over 70 indicators of health outcomes and health determinants, broken down at national and provincial/territorial levels by a range of social, economic and demographic factors. This new source of evidence can help inform policy and program development and more effectively reduce health inequalities experienced in Canada, particularly those faced by Indigenous peoples.
Significant health disparities still persist between Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations in Canada, including higher rates of infant and young child mortality, infectious and chronic diseases (e.g. tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, diabetes and cardiovascular disease) and diseases caused by environmental contamination. 
In August 2017, the Prime Minister of Canada announced the creation of a new Department of Indigenous Services Canada (ISC). The overarching vision of this new department is to support the selfdetermination of Indigenous peoples, who should control service delivery for their own communities. ISCis mandate offers tremendous opportunity to reduce health disparities within Canadais Indigenous populations.
Nearly $12 billion from the last two federal budgets was designated to improve the social determinants of Indigenous peoplesi health. This investment will expand addictions treatment and prevention services for First Nations, respond to high TB rates in Inuit communities, support access to First Nations-controlled quality health care and dedicate resources to work with First Nations partners to transform their health systems. 
In support of this, the Government of Canada is also working in partnership with Indigenous partners at the national, regional and local levels to implement an approach to service 
delivery that is patient-centred, 
focused on community wellness and effectively linked to provincial/ territorial health-care systems. Furthermore, the Government of 
Canada has signed the CanadanM\0xC8tis 
Nation Accord, the Assembly of First 
NationsnCanada Memorandum of Understanding on Joint Priorities and the Inuit Nunangat Declaration on InuitnCrown Partnership, which all identify health and wellness priorities for their communities.
Rising to the challenge
Child health
Children are vulnerable to health disparities, as negative early childhood experiences can have life-long affects. For this reason, 
Canada has dedicated childrenis health surveillance programs that focus on congenital anomalies, rare and emerging paediatric diseases, childhood cancers, injuries, as well as risk and protective factors (e.g. obesity, physical activity, sleep and child maltreatment). Canada works with leading experts and partners from across the country to improve maternal and infant health surveillance through collecting and providing timely, comprehensive information.

In partnership with private and non-profit organizations and other levels of government, Canada tests and scales up interventions to prevent chronic diseases, focusing on common risk 
Canadais Healthy Eating Strategy aims to improve the food environment in Canada to make it easier for Canadians to make healthier choices. The Strategy is made up of complementary initiatives, including a ban on using partially hydrogenated oils, regulations to restrict marketing of unhealthy foods and beverages to children, revised national dietary guidance and front-of-package labelling to indicate when food is high

Grand Challenges Canada 
Grand Challenges Canada is an innovation platform to accelerate the achievement of the SDGs. Its model enables innovators and convenes new partnerships to address collective challenges in new ways. Grand Challenges Canada has supported over 1000 programs and innovations in low- and middle-income countries and Canada, including, for example, the development of a mobile app to enhance womenis reproductive health services provided by mobile delivery units in conflict-affected areas of Iraq and projects integrating sexual and reproductive health, rights and mental health needs of refugee women in Ethiopia. Grand Challenges Canada is launching new programs such as the Humanitarian Grand Challenge, which finds innovations to help the most-vulnerable and hardest-to-reach people affected by humanitarian crises, and the Indigenous Innovation Initiative, which identifies and supports Indigenous innovators addressing the mostpressing challenges facing their people and their communities.

on drug issues. The new Canadian Drugs and Substances Strategy restores harm reduction as a key pillar\0xF3which better enables the Government to address the ongoing opioid crisis and prevent new crises\0xF3 alongside prevention, treatment and enforcement. 
Recently published scientific and policy reports, including the 2016 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) project ranked air pollution as the fourth-leading risk factor contributing to early deaths (6.9 million deaths worldwide) each year. In Canada, the GBD ranked air pollution as the 11th leading risk factor for premature death. Federal, provincial and territorial governments in Canada collaborate in the Air Quality Management System, which includes ambient air quality standards for key pollutants and actions to reduce emissions from significant sources of air pollution. In June 2016, Canada published the Multi-sector Air Pollutants Regulations to reduce air pollution from industrial boilers and heaters, cement manufacturing and stationary engines. The improvements in air quality expected from these regulations would mean 1200 fewer deaths from air pollution between 2016 and 2035.  

Infectious diseases
The rate of HIV within the general population in Canada is very low, but it is higher among gay and other men who have sex with men, people from HIV-endemic countries, people who inject drugs and Indigenous people. Canadais HIV and Hepatitis C Community Action Fund supports projects that could have the greatest impact through targeted, evidencebased interventions focused on priority populations. These projects work to prevent new infections, reduce stigma and discrimination, and increase access to testing and treatment in Canada.
Canadais National Immunization Strategy works to improve immunization coverage across Canada. The Strategyis 2016 to 2021 objectives include a vaccination coverage goal of 95% for children by 2 years of age for vaccines that are publicly funded in all provinces and territories. 
The Government of Canada works 
closely with provincial, territorial and international partners to prepare for and respond to emerging infectious diseases and have fully implemented international health regulations (IHR), per WHOis IHR Core Capacity Framework. In 2018, Canada is examining pan-Canadian compliance with IHR through a joint external evaluation, which will further assess our collective capacities to respond to public health emergencies.

Sexual and reproductive health and rights
The Government of Canada recognizes the importance of ensuring that all Canadians have access to sexual and reproductive health information and services that are relevant and sensitive to their needs. The funding the Government provides through the Canada Health clinics and programs and pregnancy health services. Canada also provides financial support for culturally appropriate and safe midwifery in First Nations and Inuit communities. The Canadian Guidelines for Sexual Health Education guides Canadais support for providing comprehensive, inclusive, evidence-based, ageappropriate and culturally sensitive sexual health education. Mental health
Improving mental health and preventing mental illness is a crosscutting priority for the Government of Canada. Working collaboratively, the Government invests in a range of initiatives and programs to improve the availability and quality of mental health services, promote positive mental health and contribute to the prevention of mental illness and suicide. For Indigenous peoples, this work includes support for the National Inuit Suicide Prevention Strategy and the culturally competent counselling services offered by the First Nations and Inuit Hope for Wellness help line.
Canada released the 2016 Progress Report on the Federal Framework for 
Suicide Prevention in December 2016. The Framework focuses on raising public awareness and reducing stigma associated with suicide, disseminating information and data to help prevent suicide and promoting the use of research and evidence-based practices in suicide prevention.

SDG 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages

Canada routinely engages a range of public health stakeholders, including regional health authorities, NGOs and disease-specific organizations, and is committed to continuing to enhance stakeholder relations. As part of these efforts, the Chief Public Health Officeris Health Professional Forum was established in January 2018 to facilitate enhanced relationships with national health professional organizations and collaboratively advance public health priorities.

Canada and the world
Despite impressive gains in global health and well-being over the past three decades, millions continue to struggle with persistent poverty and inequality. Women and girls have particular challenges in achieving healthy lives amid harmful social norms and discrimination. Adolescents in particular face poor health and nutrition outcomes due to their often marginalized status. 
As a strong global advocate for the health, rights and well-being of the poorest and most vulnerable in developing countries, Canada is committed to advancing a human rights-based approach to health. Through significant engagement at the WHO and other key multilateral forums, Canada advances this approach on important issues including gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, access to sexual and reproductive health and rights, and global health security.
To reduce unacceptably high levels of maternal and child deaths in developing countries, Canada pledged $3.5 billion for maternal, newborn and child health from 2015 to 2020, contributing to better nutrition, access to immunization, increased inclusive and equitable access to gender-sensitive health services, strengthened health and data systems, and combating infectious diseases, including efforts to eradicate polio. 
Canada is a long-standing donor to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), having disbursed over $670 million since the beginning of the initiative in 2000. In 2017, Minister of International Development and La Francophonie Marie-Claude Bibeau announced a new $100-million pledge to the GPEI at the Rotary International Polio Pledging Event, which will count toward Canadais $3.5-billion commitment to improve the health and rights of women and children.
Sexual and reproductive health and rights have an enormous impact on the trajectory of the lives of women and girls, including their health and well-being and economic opportunities. Canada is a member of She Decides, which advocates for womenis right to access all sexual and reproductive health services, including safe abortion. 
Canada announced $650 million over 3 years to support access for women and adolescent girls to the full range of sexual and reproductive health services, family planning and contraceptives, and comprehensive sexuality education, as well as to choose safe and legal abortion and access post-abortion care. 
In 2016, Canada hosted global leaders at the Fifth Replenishment Conference of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. The more than US$12.9 billion raised is expected to save 8 million lives. Canada has contributed $2.9 billion to the Global Fund since 2002.
Canada also supports the 
Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) and has committed $520 million over 5 years (2016-2020) to the initiative. GAVI is a key partner in improving coverage and equity through strengthening specific aspects of health systems such as: providing in-country leadership, management and coordination; promoting effective supply chain management; improving reliability of data; and supporting community engagement and buy-in. 
Canada is finding innovative ways to support countries in achieving SDG 3. It is a founding member and key donor ($240 million, 2015 to 2020) to the Global Financing Facility for Every Woman Every Child, an innovative and catalytic financing mechanism that accelerates country-driven progress on improving the health and well-being of women, children and adolescents.
Data and research 
As a global leader in health research, Canadais IDRC houses the Centre of Excellence for Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) Systems, a global resource hub supporting national efforts to develop, strengthen and scale up these key tools for informing national health-care policies. IDRC also supports a network of 43 think tanks in developing countries to generate high-quality evidence and convene different stakeholders to strengthen primary health-care systems to better serve the mostvulnerable populations.

\0xEF Canada will target investments announced in Budget 2017 and Budget 2018 to address specific gaps in the Canadian health-care system, such as increasing the availability of home and palliative care, helping youth access needed mental health services, and lowering the cost of prescription drugs. 
\0xEF The recently announced Advisory Council on the Implementation of National Pharmacare\0xF3a publicly funded, universal prescription drug coverage program\0xF3will release recommendations by the spring of 2019 to guide future actions in this area.
\0xEF The Government of Canada remains committed to advancing the important work of closing socioeconomic gaps between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples in Canada, including through improved quality and satisfaction of care, sustainable and sufficient health resources in communities, and predictable, long-term funding to support Indigenous-led health systems.
\0xEF Canada will host the next Women Deliver global conference in June 2019. Women Deliver is the worldis largest gathering on the health, rights and well-being of women and girls, and the event is an opportunity to bring focus and energy to Canadais feminist agenda domestically and internationally.

Goal-by-goal actions
SDG 4: Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all

Education and skills training are essential for Canadais economic and social prosperity, and for the well-being of all Canadians. The Government of Canada, in collaboration with provinces, territories and Indigenous groups, is focused on creating a culture of lifelong learning by providing its population with access to the highquality education and skills needed to reach their life goals.
In Canada, provinces and territories are responsible for the overall organization, delivery and assessment of all levels of education. Primary and secondary education is provided for free, while post-secondary education is privately funded but heavily subsidized by all levels of government. The Government of Canada contributes to post-secondary education through four main channels: the Canada Social Transfer (CST); the tax system; research and development expenditure as a means to support innovation and economic competitiveness; and student financial assistance and education savings incentives through the Canada Student Loans Program and the Canada Education Savings Program, respectively.
Rising to the challenge
To work together on common objectives in a broad range of activities at the elementary, secondary and post-secondary levels, the provinces and territories formed the Council of Ministers of Education, Canada (CMEC). CMEC provides a forum for provincial and territorial ministers of education to discuss matters of mutual interest, undertake educational initiatives cooperatively and represent the interests of the provinces and territories with national 

educational organizations, the federal government, foreign governments and international organizations. 
Learn Canada 2020 is the framework provincial and territorial education ministers have developed to enhance Canadais education systems, learning opportunities and overall education outcomes. Learn Canada 2020 encompasses four pillars of lifelong learning from early childhood to adulthood and addresses the most pressing education and learning issues facing Canadians today. The four pillars are:
1. Early childhood learning and development: All children should have access to high-quality early childhood education that ensures they arrive at school ready to learn. 
2. Elementary to secondary school systems: All children in our elementary to secondary school systems deserve teaching and learning opportunities that are inclusive and that provide them with world-class skills in literacy, numeracy and science. 
3. Post-secondary education: Canada must increase the number of students pursuing post-secondary education by increasing the quality and accessibility of post-secondary education.
4. Adult learning and skills development: Canada must develop an accessible, diversified and integrated system of adult learning and skills development that delivers training when Canadians need it.
The Government of Canada recognizes that enhancing Indigenous education is fundamental to renewing Canadais relationship with Indigenous peoples. Indigenous children, youth and adults deserve culturally appropriate, high-quality education that meets their needs while respecting Indigenous control. The Government of Canada continues to work with Indigenous peoples to develop a new partnership on Indigenous education.
Demographics of education in Canada
Canadians are among the most educated people in the world: 54% of Canadian adults aged 25 to 64 had completed post-secondary education in 2016, compared to an OECD average of 36.7%. The percentage 
of Canadians with post-secondary degrees has steadily and consistently increased since 1990, with women consistently attaining higher rates of post-secondary education than men. 
Higher levels of educational attainment have translated into higher wages for women, but gaps remain in both workforce participation and earnings. Canada still experiences a high degree of academic and therefore occupational gender segregation. For example, two thirds of post-secondary graduates in science, technology, engineering and mathematics are male, with an even greater disparity in engineering and computer science programs and skilled trades. Three quarters of enrolments and graduates in health care (e.g. nursing, pharmacy) and education are female. Gender segregation in education leads to less gender diversity across occupations and limits career opportunities for women (and men) in certain academic and vocational disciplines.
Through the Indian Residential School system, Indigenous peoples in Canada were subjected to discriminatory and severely harsh government-sanctioned and churchrun education in the past. Prime Minister Trudeauis apology on behalf

Indspire is advancing the SDGs by working to ensure equitable, quality education and to promote lifelong learning opportunities for all. It is invested in increasing 
the financial sustainability for Indigenous post-secondary education and achievements toward reconciliation. Indspire works with a variety of partners to ensure that within a generation, all Indigenous students in Canada will graduate.
of the Government of Canada and the people of Canada is backed up with several initiatives to ensure Indigenous cultural, health and educational needs are identified and addressed, but Indigenous students still face barriers to accessing education. 
Indigenous peoples have made significant gains over the past decade. In 2016, almost 74% of adults aged 25 to 64 earned at least a high school diploma or equivalent certificate (up from under 66% in 2006) and 23% of adults had a college diploma (up from 18.7%). The percentage of Indigenous men with a certificate of apprenticeship or qualification grew to 9.6% (up from 6.8%).
The Government of Canada, in collaboration with provinces, territories and Indigenous peoples, continues to build and improve Canadais education systems, specifically in following areas. 
Early childhood learning and development 
Investing in early childhood learning and child-care systems is one of the best investments that governments can make to strengthen social and economic outcomes. In June 2017, Canadais governments reached a historic agreement. The Multilateral Early Learning and Child Care Framework will enhance early childhood learning and child-care systems to improve the lives of Canadian children and their families. The Framework sets the foundation for federal, provincial and territorial governmentsi collaboration toward a shared, long-term vision of highquality early childhood learning and child care that is accessible, affordable, flexible and inclusive.

The Government of Canada is working with Indigenous peoples to develop the Indigenous Early Learning and Child Care Framework, which will reflect the unique needs and priorities of Indigenous children and families across Canada. Once developed, the Framework will strengthen early childhood learning and child-care programs and supports for Indigenous children and their families, support greater self-determination, improve socio-economic outcomes for Indigenous peoples and contribute to the process of reconciliation. 
The Government also continues to invest in urgent repairs and renovations of the educational facilities used by the Aboriginal Head Start on Reserve Program (63 facilities to date) and the First Nations and Inuit Child Care Initiative (210 childcare centres). These investments addressed critical health and safety concerns.

Multilateral Early Learning and Child Care Framework 

The Government of Canada has signed bilateral agreements on early learning and child care with all provinces and territories.
Each of these 3-year, bilateral agreements address unique early learning and child care needs, including the needs of official language minority communities. 
Primary and secondary education 
Each province and territory has established legislation, policies, programs, curriculums and practices for an elementary and secondary education system that best reflects the history, culture and learning needs of its population. The comprehensive, diversified and widely accessible nature of the education systems in Canada reflects the societal belief in the importance of education.
In Canada, there were 4,706,025 enrolments in public elementary and secondary schools in 2013-2014. While the ages for compulsory schooling may vary from one jurisdiction to another, in most jurisdictions, children enter elementary school at age 5 and graduate secondary education at age 18. 
The Council of Ministers of Education, Canada discuss or take action on matters of mutual interest. The ministers also define Canadais priorities for elementary and secondary education with a view to ensuring that all children in our elementary- to high-school systems can access learning opportunities that are inclusive and that provide them with world-class skills in literacy, numeracy and science (Learn Canada 2020).

In Canada, the CMEC Pan-Canadian Global Competencies Framework guides changes under way across a number of provinces and territories that aim to define curriculum focused on the definition of competences. Built on the foundations of literacy and numeracy, the six competencies identified by ministers of education are key to these reforms. They are interdependent and leveraged in a variety of situations and across disciplines.
Canadais global competencies 

\0xEF Critical thinking and problem solving
\0xEF Innovation, creativity and entrepreneurship
\0xEF Learning to learn/self-awareness and self-direction
\0xEF Collaboration
\0xEF Communication
\0xEF Global citizenship and sustainability
Global competencies assist students in their ability to meet the shifting and ongoing demands of life, work and learning; to be active and responsive to their communities at a range of levels from local to global; to leverage new technologies; to engage in meaningful relationships with people from countries and cultures around the world; to act responsibly to new challenges and issues; and to embrace opportunities that do not yet exist. Moreover, they contribute to educational attainment, relationships, employment, health and well-being outcomes. 
Pathways to Education Canada is helping youth succeed 

Established in 2001, Pathways to Education Canada (Pathways) is a charitable organization that works with local partners to provide youth from lower-income communities with the counseling, academic, social and financial supports they need to complete high school. Launched as a pilot project in the Regent Park area of Toronto, the Pathways program has since expanded to 20 communities across Canada. The Government of Canada has invested in Pathways since 2010.
The Pathways program has proven to be very successful. For the 2015-2016 academic year, on-time graduation rates have increased by an average of 79% across program locations with graduating cohorts in Ontario, Nova Scotia, and 
Quebec, compared to pre-Pathways graduation rates. Between 2004 and 2015, nearly 5,000 Pathways students successfully graduated from high school; nearly three quarters of these graduates have gone on to pursue post-secondary education or training, further improving their prospects for finding good, well-paying jobs.
Since 2016, the Government of Canada has worked closely with various Indigenous partners to implement an inclusive and comprehensive engagement process aimed at developing recommendations to strengthen on-reserve education. To ensure that Indigenous children on reserve receive a quality education, the Government has made substantial investments in primary and secondary education, including to address immediate needs and to keep pace with growth over the medium term, and particularly in language and cultural programming, 
literacy and numeracy programs, and special needs education. The Government is working with Indigenous partners to transform the way kindergarten to grade 12 Indigenous education is funded. 
The Government co-developed a policy to strengthen First Nations primary and secondary education. The policy, endorsed by the Chiefsin-Assembly in December 2017, will support First Nations control of First Nations education and make federal funding allocations more sufficient, predictable and sustainable. Post-secondary education 
While Canadians know that quality education gives them the tools they need to succeed, many Canadians face multiple challenges that make it difficult to access post-secondary education and/or training. Adults may need to re-train for a better job, but post-secondary education may be unaffordable and out of reach. Youth may struggle to complete high school for a variety of reasons, such as having to balance school with a part-time job, or not having a home environment that helps them focus on their studies. 
The Government of Canada has taken significant steps to make post-secondary education more affordable for students. For example, the Government has increased Canada Student Grants for students from lower- and middle-income families. Canada Student Grant amounts for students from low- and middle-income families and part-time students were increased by 50%, giving over 360,000 students more financial assistance they will not have to pay back, and eligibility for these grants was expanded, making approximately 46,000 students newly eligible.
The Government has also simplified the Canada Student Loans Program application process and increased the loan repayment threshold by approximately 23%, so that students do not have to repay their loans until they are earning at least $25,000 per year. This increased threshold helps to ease studentsi transition into the workforce. 
To ensure that Indigenous students have the same opportunities for success as other Canadian students, in 2017 the Government of Canada increased, by $90 million over 2 years, funding for the Post-Secondary Student Support Program. This increase in funding will support the post-secondary education and financial needs of over 4,600 First Nations and Inuit students enrolled in qualifying post-secondary programs.  Skills training 
In addition, through the new Skills Boost initiative, beginning in the fall of 2018, adults returning to school on a full-time basis after several years in the workforce will be eligible to receive additional grant funding per school year, on top of the other grants and loans available to students. Skills Boost will also allow unemployed 
Canadians to continue receiving Employment Insurance benefits when taking self-funded training.
Educational supports for youth and adults help open the gateway into the workplace. As the job market increasingly places a premium on a diverse skill set, Canadians may need to upgrade their skills throughout their careers. On top of the nearly $3 billion per year in current transfers to provinces and territories in support of skills training and employment programs, the Government is ramping up funding to an additional 21% by 2021-2022. Transfers have also been made simpler, more flexible and more responsive to the needs of employers and workers, including those currently under-represented in the workforce. Taken together, this funding is helping individuals across all age groups and backgrounds\0xF3from youth to more experienced workers, newcomers to Canada, and persons with disabilities and others\0xF3so that all Canadians have the opportunity to find and keep good jobs.
Indigenous people are less likely to be employed than non-Indigenous Canadians, and for those who do work, they typically earn less. The Aboriginal Skills and Employment Training Strategy has existed for many years, but funding levels have not kept up with population growth and needs. The Government recognized that more needs to be done to help close the employment and earnings gap between Indigenous peoples and non-Indigenous Canadians. The new Indigenous Skills and Employment Training Program increases funding by 34% compared to the previous program, thus helping more Indigenous Canadians gain skills and find jobs to support themselves and their families. The Program also recognizes the unique needs of First Nations, Inuit and M\0xC8tis by establishing distinct programmatic and funding streams.  
Canada and the world 
Canada is a destination for quality education, and is engaging broadly to attract potential students, thereby advancing inclusive and equitable quality education in line with the Sustainable Development Goals.
The Government of Canada offers short-term scholarships for international students and researchers in Canada and for Canadians studying or doing research internationally. For example, Global Affairs Canada supports various scholarship programs:
Innovative partnerships 

In light of the evolving need of the Canadian economy, a range of innovative approaches to education and skills training are being explored by provincial and territorial governments in collaboration with industry and other non-government actors.
The Government of Ontariois Career Ready Fund helps providers offer more career-oriented experiential learning experiences for post-secondary students and recent graduates.
The Government of British Columbiais collaborative Skills for Jobs Blueprint aims to develop apprenticeships and skills training for in-demand occupations.
The Council of Atlantic Ministers of Education and Trainingis competencies framework helps post-secondary students transition from study to work.
The Government of Newfoundland and Labradoris Adult Literacy Grants for 
Community-Based Organizations supports the coordination of one-to-one adult basic literacy tutoring for larger volunteer tutoring organizations. 
\0xEF The Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Scholarship, which seeks to maximize the potential of young people to address the challenges of the 21st century through a graduatelevel scholarship and internship program for Canadian students and for students from Commonwealth developing countries;
\0xEF The African Leaders of Tomorrow Scholarship Program, which seeks to prepare the next generation of innovative leaders in sub-Saharan Africa to actively contribute to their local and global communities and to advance economic prosperity, social justice and equity in Africa; and,
\0xEF The Canadian Francophonie Scholarship Program, which is designed to build institutional capacities by training employed nationals from developing countries of La Francophonie.  
Furthermore, the Global Affairs 
Canada sponsored Student Exchange Program (SEP) offers short-term scholarships to support the development of human capital and the next generation of leaders in the Americas while strengthening the linkages between post-secondary institutions in Canada and Latin America and the Caribbean. The SEP is comprised of four programs that offer approximately 650 shortterm scholarships at the college, undergraduate and graduate levels:
\0xEF Emerging Leaders in the Americas Program;
\0xEF Canada-Chile Leadership Exchange Scholarship; 
\0xEF Canada-CARICOM Leadership Scholarships Program; and 
\0xEF Canada-CARICOM Faculty Leadership Program.
The scholarships also advance Canadais priorities for the Americas: democratic and accountable governance, human rights, the environment, diversity and Indigenous peoples. Over 400 scholarships are awarded every year for a total of over 4,000 scholarships since 2009.
We also pursue strategic partnerships with countries around the world to encourage cooperation in the field of education, as well as participate in international summits and forums linked to education, higher education and skills development that address key issues, challenges and best practices. Overall, Canadais efforts in international education contribute to advancing Canadais Innovation Agenda and Global Skills Strategy through attracting and retaining higher quality international students and researchers.
Canadais Feminist International Assistance Policy aims to ensure that the poorest and most vulnerable have access to quality education, particularly girls, adolescent girls, and women. To better support equal educational opportunities for girls, adolescent girls, and women in developing countries and achieve SDG 4 (quality education), the Government of Canada has committed to helping ensure that girls, adolescent girls, and women get the skills training and education they need to succeed, that school facilities are safe and welcoming spaces that respond to the specific needs of girls, and that those who have missed out on a quality education are provided with life skills and technical and vocational education and training, with an emphasis on assisting women and marginalized youth to find work. 
Canada will also integrate gender equality and the empowerment of girls and women across all education initiatives, in addition to specifically targeting efforts at girls, adolescent girls, and women. Canada will also engage men and boys at all school levels to challenge harmful norms, attitudes and practices and to transform gender inequalities and unequal power relations. Canada will address barriers and gaps that prevent marginalized groups, particularly girls, adolescent girls, and women from accessing and completing quality education and skills development programs.
In 2015, an estimated 39 million girls were out of school because of wars and disasters. Four of the five countries with the largest gender gaps in education are crisis and conflictaffected. Canada supports equitable quality education and lifelong learning opportunities for all and has been a long-standing champion of education in emergencies, protracted crises and fragile states. Over the last 15 years, Canada has prioritized support to basic education for children in a number of fragile and conflict-affected states, such as Afghanistan, Colombia and Mali, as well as countries affected by natural disasters, such as Haiti. For example, Canada is providing 
$106 million to UNICEFis No Lost 
Generation activities under Canadais Middle East Strategy (2016-2019) for Iraq, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon. Complementary to this, under the Middle East Strategy, Canada is delivering over $100 million in longerterm development assistance to build inclusive and quality education systems in Jordan and Lebanon that equally benefit all girls, boys and marginalized children, including refugee children, enrolled in public schools.  
Canada has also supported the 
Education Cannot Wait initiative (ECW), which has started to achieve results in partner countries. As of 
March 2018, ECW had invested $81 million in 14 countries affected by conflict, population displacement and natural disasters. These investments support access to quality education for more than 650,000 children and youth\0xF3among the most vulnerable and hard-to-reach on the globe.  
Canada delivers international assistance in developing countries and in conflict-affected and fragile states with various partners, including governments and multilateral and non-governmental organizations and mechanisms. 
One of the main outcomes of the 
2018 G7 Summit was the Charlevoix 
Declaration on Quality Education for Girls, Adolescent Girls and Women in Developing Countries, which aims to close the gaps in quality and access to education during conflict and crisis, and for refugees and the internally displaced, both inside and outside camps.  
To support this commitment, Canada and other partners also announced investments of close to $3.8 billion, marking a fundamental shift toward improving access and reducing barriers to quality education in developing countries and in conflict-affected and fragile states. This announcement represents the single-largest investment in education for women and girls in crisis and conflict situations. It has the potential to make a difference in the lives of millions of the worldis most-vulnerable women and girls. Canada is investing $400 million over 3 years in addition to the $180 million provided in January 2018 to the Global Partnership for Education for 2018-2020.    
Next steps
\0xEF An effective skills strategy iintegral to building an inclusive, resilient, responsive and efficient labour market. Governmental education and skills training strategies will be an essential part of helping Canadians adapt to change.
\0xEF Many Canadians are well equipped to take advantage of emerging opportunities thanks to strong education outcomes. In a rapidly evolving labour market, however, we need to address persistent and emerging challenges and continue to work with all partners, including Indigenous peoples, to improve education results for all Canadians. 
\0xEF Canadais leadership in the global education sector will be guided by the Feminist International Assistance Policy, drawing on global evidence and proven results to address gaps in access, quality, equity and governance and accountability. Canada will also engage in innovative approaches and partnerships with all stakeholders and leverage its assistance to create new financing options for education.  

Goal-by-goal actions
SDG 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women 

and girls
Despite progress over the last several decades, gender inequality persists. Women and girls often face multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, including due to their race, ethnicity, geographic location, income and education status, religion, language, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, ability or migrant or refugee status. Around the world, including in Canada, discrimination and ingrained social and gender biases continue to limit women and girlsi participation and advancement in economic, social and political spheres. 
Canada envisions a world where all women and girls are valued and empowered, have control over their own lives, fully participate as decision makers in their homes and societies, and contribute to and benefit from development and prosperity equally. 
To advance gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, the Government of Canada has adopted a whole-of-government approach, built on two foundational elements that put gender equality at the centre of decision making:  
1. Canadais Gender Results Framework articulates goals for gender equality and how progress will be measured. 
2. Systematic use of Genderbased Analysis Plus (GBA+) will inform federal policy, program development and implementation and other activities, including gender-based budgeting and inclusive consultations. 
This two-pronged approach to achieve SDG 5 will reinforce Canadais progress across all other SDGs.

By providing a space for all women and girls that is free from harmful gender norms, GGC empowers every girl to discover herself. GGC creates programming that is responsive to the unique needs of todayis girls, and aims to give them a voice, choice and scope to take action.
Support for women and girls  new to Canada 

Immigrant and refugee women and girls face distinct and multiple challenges in Canada, including language acquisition, work transitions, childcare responsibilities, developing new networks and shifting traditional family dynamics. The Government of Canada supports targeted settlement services for these women and their families, including women-only language classes and conversation

for transgender and non-binary conforming individuals. Amendments to the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code in 2017 added protection against discrimination, hate crimes or hate propaganda based on gender identity or expression. Later that year, Prime Minister Trudeau formally apologized to LGBTQ2 Canadians for the persecution and injustices they have suffered due to past actions of the federal government and committed to work with the LGBTQ2 community for equality and inclusion.
Social norms need to change. They perpetuate the unequal distribution of power between women and men, which affects and shapes roles, responsibilities, opportunities and outcomes differentiated by gender. That is why the Government is funding Status of Women Canada to develop an engagement strategy for men and boys that promotes equality and pilots innovative, targeted approaches to addressing inequality.
Supporting increased representation 
of women at all levels of decision making
Despite the gender-balanced Cabinet, women remain under-represented in Canadais national parliament and make up only 27% of its members. Comparatively, women members accounted for 21% of Parliament a decade ago.
Employment equity policies and legislation in Canada contribute to women holding 54% of legislator and senior government official positions in 2015, up from 37% in 1987. The Government of Canada implemented an open, transparent and merit-based approach to selecting candidates for approximately 1500 federal appointments in 2016. Since then, women appointees have increased by 10% to comprise 44% of all federal appointees.
Progress is slower in the private sector, where only 21% of senior managers were women in 2017 
(albeit an increase from 1987). The

federal corporate governance laws to support the increase of womenis participation on corporate boards and in senior management positions. 
Canada invests in initiatives addressing systemic barriers to gender equality and supporting increased representation of women in senior decision-making positions, in democratic and public life, and in other under-represented fields. Initiatives include the Apprenticeship 
Incentive Grant for Women, the Women in Construction Fund and the CanCode and PromoScience programs.  
Increasing womenis economic prosperity and security
Canadais economic future depends on all people having equal opportunity to reach their full potential, but disparities persist in womenis labour force participation rate\0xF382% in 2014 compared with 91% for men\0xF3and the gender wage gap\0xF3Canadian women earned $0.87 for every dollar earned by men in 2017, based on average hourly earnings. 
The gender wage gap must be closed to achieve gender equality. The Government of Canada will introduce pay equity legislation to ensure that women working in federally regulated industries receive equal pay for equal work or work of equal value. This initiative complements a broader array of recent federal initiatives:
\0xEF enhanced financing for better training, and learning opportunities for women and girls in underrepresented fields;
\0xEF the new Women Entrepreneurship Strategy;
\0xEF enhanced parental leave; and
\0xEF more flexible work arrangements for federally regulated employees.

The Government of Canada has made important investments to improve access to affordable early childhood learning and child-care options, to support womenis participation in the economy. The 2017 Multilateral Early Learning and Child Care Framework will guide new federal/provincial/ territorial investments to focus on increasing quality, accessibility, affordability, flexibility and inclusivity in early childhood learning and child care. The Government of Canada has signed bilateral agreements on early learning and child care with all provinces and territories. Also, the federal government and Indigenous organizations are developing an Indigenous Early Learning and Child Care Framework to reflect the unique cultural needs of First Nations, Inuit and M\0xC8tis children across Canada. Addressing gender-based violence
Data indicators suggest improvements in Canadais gender-based violence (GBV) rate. For example, the rate of intimate partner physical and sexual violence against women reported to police decreased by 11% between 2009 and 2016. 
In June 2017, the Government launched Itis Time: Canadais Strategy to Prevent and Address GenderBased Violence. The Strategy is a whole-of-government response to GBV for prevention of gender-based violence, support for survivors and their families, and promotion of responsive legal and justice systems. 
The Minister of Status of Women has also established an Advisory Council to inform the development and implementation of Canadais GBV strategy. Council members, representing a broad range of sectors and areas of expertise, speak to the particular barriers facing diverse and vulnerable groups and were selected to reflect expertise in prevention, supporting survivors, and justice and other system responses. 
The Government of Canada also supports the development of guidance and training to equip health professionals to recognize and respond safely to family violence. Investments are also being made in community-based programs that promote and improve the physical and mental health and well-being of survivors of violence, including projects to reach vulnerable groups. 
In 2016, the Government of Canada, along with the provinces and territories, launched the independent National Inquiry into Missing and 
Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. The Inquiry primarily seeks to identify the root causes of violence against Indigenous women and girls with a view to making recommendations to reduce the incidence of violence. 
A 2017 report indicated that incidents of harassment and sexual violence in federal workplaces are under-reported and are dealt with ineffectively. Canada introduced new legislation in 
November 2017 to strengthen Canada Labour Code provisions by putting in place a comprehensive approach to addressing the full spectrum of harassment and violence and expanding coverage to all federally regulated workplaces.

Canada and the world
The Government of Canada is at the vanguard of international efforts to advance gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, and has demonstrated its commitment to support the full and equal realization and enjoyment of human rights by all women and girls around the world. Consistent with the Gender Results Framework, Canada takes a feminist approach to its overall international policy, including diplomacy, development, trade and security. Through Canadais diplomatic relations, this approach sees women and girls as equal decision makers and amplifies their voices, promotes and protects their rights and fosters conditions so they have greater access to and control over resources. The importance of gender equality to development has been broadly recognized as a prerequisite to achieving sustainable development and building a more peaceful, more inclusive and more prosperous world. The potential of women and girls to be transformative agents of change is at the heart of Canadais Feminist International Assistance Policy. This Policy was developed following broad consultation with national, multilateral and international partners, and local stakeholders in partner countries. 
Canadian Federation of University Women 
The Canadian Federation of University Women works locally, nationally and internationally to improve the status of women by promoting human rights, public education, social justice and peace. Every year, they award more than $1 million in scholarships to women pursuing post-secondary education. The Federation also sends a delegation to the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women annually. Members across Canada advocate for a world where poverty is reduced, discrimination is eliminated and equal opportunities for leadership, employment, income and education are passionately promoted.
The Feminist International Assistance Policy commits that 15% of Canadais bilateral international assistance will be dedicated to targeted gender equality programming, and no less than 80% of bilateral international assistance will go to initiatives that effectively integrate gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls in their results by 2021-2022. Combining these two objectives means that, by 2021-2022 at the latest, at least 95% of Canadais bilateral international development assistance investments will either target or integrate gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls. Canada is making consistent progress toward these targets and continues to monitor this work.
Canada is funding several new signature initiatives to support the Feminist International Assistance Policy, including:
\0xEF $650 million to support access to the full range of sexual and reproductive health services and information, including to prevent and respond to sexual and genderbased violence;
\0xEF $150 million over 5 years for the 
Womenis Voice and Leadership Program to support local womenis organizations and movements in developing countries; and 
\0xEF Up to $300 million toward expanding innovative partnerships and leveraging additional funding from the private sector, investors and philanthropic organizations to support the advancement of gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls in developing countries.
In February 2018, the Government of Canada announced $8.3 million to support a Womenis Voice and Leadership initiative in Haiti. This contribution will help Haitian womenis organizations strengthen their capacity and develop more sustainable sources of funding. This will ensure they can make lasting contributions that every society needs.

Canadais Progressive Trade Agenda seeks to ensure that all segments of society can take advantage of and benefit from opportunities flowing from trade and investment. Gender equality has been pursued by Canada during trade negotiations, notably via commitments to non-discrimination in the labour chapters, Canada seeks more ways to incorporate gender considerations in free trade agreements. For example, Canada has integrated Trade and Gender chapters in its modernized FTAs with Chile and Israel. 
The 2017 National Action Plan on 
Women, Peace and Security guides Canadais development assistance, humanitarian action, and peace and security efforts in fragile and conflictaffected states. A complementary initiative\0xF3the Elsie Initiative on Women in Peace Operations\0xF3seeks to overcome the barriers to womenis meaningful participation in peace operations.
Next steps 
To further support the realization of SDG 5, the Government of Canada will:
\0xEF develop a strategy that engages men and boys as partners in advancing gender equality; 
\0xEF implement Canadais Gender Results Framework;
\0xEF introduce departmental legislation to make Status of Women Canada an official department of the Government of Canada; and
\0xEF enhance the Womenis Programis 
ability to support the sustainability of equality-seeking organizations by increasing organizational and sector capacity and ensuring better funding for organizations focused on vulnerable women.
\0xEF legislate GBA+ to make gender budgeting a permanent part of Canadais budget-making process;

SDG 6: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all

Water connects the environment with our livelihoods. Improving access to clean water, especially in areas vulnerable to water scarcity, alleviates poverty, improves health and is a precondition for improved quality of life. 
Access to water for drinking and sanitation in Canada is nearly universal and generally of good quality. Access to clean water, however, has yet to be secured for all Canadians. Perhaps for no one is this inequity more persistent than for Indigenous peoples in Canada. 
Indigenous communities across Canada continue to experience health problems caused by poor water and sanitation. First Nations reserves and communities with long-term boil water advisories are faced with the burden of having to boil and/or obtain bottled water for daily use and consumption. This burden is compounded by socio-economic barriers that include poor housing and infrastructure, remoteness and poverty.
A key component of the Government of Canadais commitment to close the socio-economic gaps that exist between Indigenous and most nonIndigenous peoples in Canada is to address the challenges of access to clean water and sanitation in communities.  
Rising to the challenge 
Canada focuses on ensuring concrete, lasting outcomes for Indigenous peoples and communities, particularly with respect to the areas of improved health outcomes and reliable infrastructure. 
The Government of Canada is committed to end long-term drinking water advisories on reserve by March 2021, to improve water infrastructure on reserve and to prevent short-term advisories from becoming long-term.

SDG 6: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all


Canada is delivering a long-term strategy for drinking water in First Nations communities. This strategy ultimately aims to achieve greater  self-determination through transferring full control and management of drinking water to First Nations communities. 
This objective will take time and will be advanced through collaborative partnerships in several areas, including infrastructure program reform, the review and refinement of drinking water legislation including the Safe Drinking Water for First Nations Act, and facilitating the establishment of innovative First Nations-led governance structures such as First Nations water authorities.
As part of the Government of Canadais commitment to Indigenous peoples and ongoing reconciliation efforts, the 2016 federal budget provided $1.8 billion over 5 years for on-reserve water and wastewater infrastructure to address health and safety needs, ensure proper facility operation and maintenance, and eliminate long-term drinking water advisories on public systems on reserve. Canadais 2018 
budget earmarked an additional $172.6 million over 3 years, starting in 2018-2019, to improve access to clean and safe drinking water on reserve and accelerate construction and renovation of affected water systems. Together, these investments allow for the long-term planning that is essential for meaningful change. 
International Development Research Centre 

As part of Canadais international assistance efforts, IDRC has invested more than $100 million over three decades to support research on water and water-related issues such as poverty reduction, improving health and sanitation, and increasing local governmentsi ability to provide sustainable services to citizens. 
This experience has demonstrated time and again not only that water is a complex issue around which political, economic, social and environmental priorities compete, but that real and lasting changes require the support of policies that are reinforced by science and the close involvement of local partners and communities.
Progress is under way as investments roll out to First Nations communities. For example: 
\0xEF Between November 2015 and April 3, 2018, there was an overall reduction of approximately 830 homes and 75 community buildings affected by long-term drinking water advisories on reserve. 
\0xEF As of December 2017, approximately $754 million of the 2016 budget funding had been allocated to 420 water and wastewater projects that are planned, under way or completed. These projects will serve approximately 302,000 people in 297 First Nations communities.
There are other investments and programming across federal departments and agencies that support Canadais implementation of SDG 6. For example, the $180-billion Investing in Canada Plan provides support for infrastructure solutions including treating water and wastewater, managing storm water and mitigating the impacts of flooding and other risks. The Planis Green Infrastructure investment stream assists with building capacity to treat and manage water, wastewater and storm water, accessing potable water and reducing or remediating soil and air pollution throughout Canada. These investments ensure that more wastewater systems meet federal treatment standards and will lead to cleaner water, air and soil for all Canadians.
Centre for Affordable Water and Sanitation Technology 
The Centre for Affordable Water and Sanitation Technology (CAWST) helps people all over the world get safe drinking water and adequate sanitation in their own homes by providing capacity development services to complement technology infrastructure. Recognizing that women can be powerful agents 
of change, CAWST puts women 
at the centre of poverty alleviation by empowering them with the knowledge and skills to provide water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services in their homes and communities. CAWST helps empower women to become WASH technicians, entrepreneurs 
and community leaders.
The Investing in Canada Plan allocates $9.2 billion to provinces and territories for green infrastructure investments to support mitigation projects, build infrastructure to help communities respond and adapt to the impacts of a changing climate, and build other green infrastructure that supports a healthy environment, including water and wastewater infrastructure. This segment features bilateral agreements, signed between the Government of Canada and the provinces/territories, regarding costsharing for agreed-to projects. 
Furthermore, the $2-billion Clean Water and Wastewater Fund supports investments into water and wastewater systems. These projects address flood risk and reduce the potential for wastewater treatment systems being overwhelmed by separating wastewater and storm water collection pipes, delivering benefits to residents by better protecting their families, property and livelihoods.
The Government of Canadais Federal Sustainable Development Strategy outlines whole-of-government action to ensure all Canadians have access to safe drinking water and that the significant challenges Indigenous communities face are addressed. These actions include funding for water and wastewater services, monitoring of on-reserve drinking water quality and research, analysis to support water resource management, and collaboration with all provinces and territories on Guidelines for 
Canadian Drinking Water Quality.
Canada and the world
Climate change impacts are often experienced through water-related changes, and so climate action is integrated throughout the Government of Canadais water-related development assistance. Water-related climate change impacts include floods, droughts, storm surges, melting sea ice, rising sea-levels and ocean acidification. Canada recognizes the impact of climate change on the poorest and most vulnerable, who are the least able to cope.
Since 2014-2015, the Government of Canada has contributed an average of $98.9 million annually to initiatives to improve availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation in developing countries. This figure does not include the Government of Canadais humanitarian action, which often has significant water-related components.

More than 60% of Canadais bilateral water-related investments are in Africa. Women and girls are often the primary producers of food and providers of water, heating and cooking fuel for their households. This bilateral assistance supports women to increase drought resilience of their crops and to improve their access to clean water.
From 2014 to 2017, the Government of Canada provided $7.5 million for the WinS (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene in Schools) for Girls project, a multi-country program and partnership, led by UNICEF and the UN Girlsi Education Initiative, to increase the number of girls completing primary school and entering secondary schools by addressing menstrual hygiene management and cultural norms. 
Canada is the lead donor, funding WinS programming in 10 countries.
Additional funding includes $5 million to the Building Resilience in ConflictAffected Communities in Iraq project, to improve water services and train municipal authorities. This 2015 to 2019 project has brought safe water to 285,000 internally displaced persons and host community residents. These actions helped reduce tensions caused by population displacements in northern Iraq and enhanced the resilience of communities.
Next steps 
\0xEF Work to eliminate all long-term drinking water advisories on First Nations reserves.
\0xEF Support strong Indigenous institutions playing a leading role in the delivery of public services to Indigenous peoples.
\0xEF Deliver on Canadais commitment under the Feminist International Assistance Policy to address water issues, including sustainable access to clean water, adequate sanitation and proper hygiene, and integrated water resource management. Canadais approach will ensure that the needs and priorities of women and girls are addressed.

SDG 7: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all
Ensuring access to affordable and sustainable energy is critical to the quality of our lives and the strength of our economy. Countries that overcome the challenges\0xF3and seize the opportunities\0xF3of the transition to cleaner forms of energy are likely to reap enormous benefits. 
In a country as large and northern as Canada, it is not surprising that a lot of energy is required to heat our homes and businesses in the winter or to travel across the vast expanses of our country. Indeed, Canada is one of the worldis largest per-capita consumers of energy. 
At the same time, the impressive size of our country means Canada has an abundance of natural resources, including some of the largest oil and gas reserves on the planet, which are developed under very robust and thorough environmental and regulatory regimes.
Thanks to an abundance of hydro power and world-leading nuclear technology, Canadais electricity is among the least expensive and cleanest in the world. In 2015, Canadian households spent an average of $4,198 on energy. Fully 80% of electricity comes from nonemitting sources, enabling Canada to make significant progress toward SDG 7: affordable and clean energy. The energy sector also contributes to nearly 10% of Canadais GDP and directly employs nearly 900,000 Canadians.
As the world makes the transition to a lower-carbon future, Canada faces several key challenges, including meeting increasing energy demands while reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and facilitating the supply of alternative sources of energy to support a smooth transition.  
To realize that goal, Canada is making generational investments in clean energy and energy efficiency, as 
57

Rising to the challenge
To ensure that Canadians have access to affordable, clean energy, Governments are acting in three key areas: energy efficiency, clean electricity and renewables, and cleaner fuels.  
Energy efficiency
sources of energy. At the same time, Canada is working internationally to enhance energy security and fasttrack the adoption of clean energy.
Global oil and natural gas demand is projected to continue to rise for some time. Canada has the opportunity to supply some of this demand, while reducing the GHG intensity of the oil 
can be a preferred supplier due to its world leading regulatory systems and environmental policies. In situations where lower-carbon Canadian natural gas replaces higher-carbon fuels (such as coal in other countries), Canada will be helping reduce global carbon emissions. At the same time, revenues from oil and gas production will help fund the lower-carbon transition.    
The best energy is the energy we do not use. By doing more with less, Canadians can significantly reduce GHG emissions, save money, improve their environment and make their homes more comfortable. Greater energy efficiency will also enhance the competitiveness of businesses by maximizing their productivity and lowering costs. Canada is making significant investments in energy efficiency, including by developing model building and retrofit codes, implementing a national approach to mandatory energy labelling and disclosure, and funding demonstration projects.  

Figure 7.1 Canada has a diverse and abundant energy portfolio


Clean electricity
Clean, non-emitting electricity systems will be the cornerstone of a modern, lower-carbon economy. Several programs have been introduced to support this goal, including initiatives to reduce the use of diesel in rural and remote areas, including for Indigenous communities, and support renewable power technologies, such as geothermal, tidal and offshore wind projects. The Government of Canada has also allocated funding for next-generation smart grid storage and clean electricity technology projects that help electric systems make better use of renewable energy and help expand renewable power capacity.

Cleaner fuels
Cleaner fuels such as biofuels, hydrogen and natural gas are critical parts of Canadais lower-carbon future. Their use can reduce emission levels from that of using existing fuels, while also removing carbon from fuels that are difficult to electrify, such as aviation fuel. 
Canada is the worldis fourth-largest producer of natural gas and accounts for around 5% of global production. Natural gas has 50% fewer emissions than coal, and Canada is exploring opportunities to further reduce emissions from upstream development. By exporting liquefied natural gas, Canada can play a key role in the global energy transition. 
Bioenergy has gained wider interest as a renewable alternative to fossil fuels. Canada has the most biomass per capita in the world. To capture that potential, the Government of Canada has developed a strategy aimed at making Canada a leader in the emerging bio-economy.
Accelerating clean technology (clean tech) research and development is a key component of Canadais approach to sustainable economic growth.
The global economy is moving toward a lower-carbon future and the Government of Canada has taken a number of important steps to seize these opportunities. It has launched programs to modernize electricity grids and storage facilities, making it easier to integrate renewable energy. The Government of Canada also established the Canada Infrastructure Bank, which will invest in green infrastructure projects. 
Extended tax support  for clean energy 

Canada works with businesses to encourage investment in clean energy generation and promote the use of energy efficient equipment. To reduce the emission of GHGs and air pollutants, the federal government extended tax provisions that allow companies to accelerate the depreciation on assets that are more energy efficient.
Through its Oil and Gas Clean Technology Program, the Government of Canada has made investments to support industry-led clean energy technologies to improve environmental performance and help reduce GHG emissions. This is important, since conventional fuels\0xF3that is, oil and gas\0xF3will be an important part of the global energy mix as we transition to a lower-carbon economy. Canada is also funding projects to demonstrate carbon capture, use and storage, as well as projects to improve detection, measurement and management of methane and volatile organic compound emissions. Many of these projects leverage privatesector support. Canadais oil and gas producers have already made significant improvements in the GHG emissions intensity of production.   
Significant investments are being made to develop a national network of charging and re-fuelling stations for alternative fuel vehicles. This infrastructure will enable Canadians to use lower-carbon or zero-emission vehicles.
Actions are also under way to increase energy efficiency in the residential and industrial sectors. In 2017, federal, provincial and territorial energy ministers released Canadais Building Strategy, which includes a framework for actions under the PanCanadian Framework. 
A number of jurisdictions created or expanded industrial energy efficiency incentives, performance standards and other supportive measures. These include encouraging industries to adopt energy management systems that reduce energy use and emissions and save money.  Women in clean energy
Both in Canada and around the world, women make up substantially less than half of the science, technology, engineering and mathematics workforce. The Clean Energy, Education and Empowerment (C3E) initiative works to promote gender equality in the clean energy sector. Canada has appointed four ambassadors to this initiative and has contributed to the C3Eis first report, \0xECKnowledge, Gaps and Opportunities. 
Canada also co-launched the Equal by 30 campaign, which aims to bring together leadership from across the energy sector to find common ground for action to achieve equal pay, equal leadership and equal opportunities by 2030. 
These initiatives could influence not only the gender balance within the energy sector, but also increase employment opportunities and financial independence for women around the world.

SDG 7: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all	59

Canadian Nuclear Laboratories 
Canadian Nuclear Laboratories (CNL) is Canadais premier nuclear science and technology organization and a world leader in developing peaceful and innovative applications from nuclear technology. Sustainable development is achievable only with access to clean, reliable and affordable energy. Energy is connected to all human activities and is the engine for economic sectors like agriculture, industry, commerce and even transportation. By promoting and providing nuclear energy, CNL continues its commitment to ensuring that Canadians and the world receive energy, health and environmental benefits from nuclear science and technology with confidence that nuclear safety and security are assured.
Engagement
Domestic and international collaboration is essential to meeting our clean energy goals. 
That is why all levels of government and key stakeholders are working together at the national and international levels to advance Canadais clean energy future. 
Canada is committed to a renewed relationship with Indigenous peoples based on the recognition of rights and partnership. As part of this commitment, all levels of government are seeking ways to improve access to cleaner, more reliable and sustainable sources of power for Indigenous communities.
For example, the Wataynikaneyap 
Power Project, the largest First 
Nations grid connection project in Ontario, connects 16 First Nations to the provincial power grid. By working with the provincial government and controlling the development of major infrastructure within their traditional lands, First Nations communities are paving the way to greater prosperity and economic self-determination.
Connecting these communities to the provincial grid is expected to result in lower costs over the long term by reducing costs for diesel power generation. 
At the federal level, the Government of Canada is also strengthening the role of Indigenous peoples in project reviews, monitoring and policy development. For example, the Government of Canada and Indigenous peoples co-developed Indigenous advisory and monitoring committees as a forum for Indigenous communities to participate in monitoring the full lifecycle of pipeline projects.
As Canada is a federation, it is imperative that our various levels of government work together to deliver clean energy to Canadians. 
In December 2016, Canadais first ministers signed the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change. The Framework includes more than 50 policy actions, across all sectors of the economy, under four pillars: mitigation, clean technology, carbon pricing and adaptation. Collaboration by federal, provincial and territorial energy ministers also supports the Canadian Energy Strategy. Important progress 
has been made in energy efficiency, infrastructure, technology and innovation, as well as in international collaboration.
In April 2017, the Government of Canada launched Generation Energy, the largest national conversation about energy in Canadais history. More than 380,000 people contributed their ideas and insights, including women, youth and members of Indigenous communities. What emerged was a vision of a prosperous energy future that balances environmental sustainability and economic interests, one that creates new energy industries and positions Canada as a leader in the lower-carbon future. All levels of government are now looking at ways to continue the dialogue begun by Generation Energy.
To advance shared objectives at the continental level, the Government of Canada renewed its partnership with the United States and Mexico through the Leadersi Statement on a North American Climate, Clean Energy and Environment Partnership. Under this agreement, the three countries agreed to align energy efficiency regulations, make energy infrastructure more resilient and reduce methane emissions. 
Pan-Canadian Framework on 
Clean Growth and Climate Change 

The Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Changes focuses on accelerating innovation, supporting clean technology and creating jobs.
Federal, provincial and territorial governments have committed to take meaningful action to reduce GHG emissions across all regions and sectors of the economy.


SDG indicator 7.2.1  Renewable 
energy share in the total final energy consumption

Canada has continued working with its North American partners to further develop North Americais vast energy resources and innovation potential. For example, in November 2017, the North American Energy Ministerial was held to advance discussions on safety, security and resiliency, trade and economic development and diversifying energy resources. 
In addition, Canada is working with its continental partners on the North American Renewable Integration Study (NARIS). By 2019, NARIS is expected to identify the key opportunities and challenges of integrating large amounts of wind, solar and hydro capacity into the North American electricity grid.  
Canada and the world
Canada is proud to participate in a number of international initiatives that are paving the way to a lower-carbon future and supporting clean energy, including in developing countries. 
The Government of Canada has bilateral mechanisms with various global partners, including the United States, Mexico, European nations, China, India and Japan. High-level dialogues and memorandums of understanding are advancing cooperation in areas such as oil and gas emissions, nuclear energy for peaceful uses, clean tech development, energy efficiency and renewable energy. 
Multilaterally, Canada is participating in the Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM) and Mission Innovation (MI) to share best practices and accelerate the development of clean technologies. Canada is the official host for CEM/ MI 2019, where we will demonstrate our leadership in innovation and our expertise in the development and deployment of clean energy technologies. Canada also supports the International Energy Agencyis Clean Energy Transitions Programme, which helps developing countries enhance their capacity to develop and deploy clean energy technologies.
Canada has also announced its intention to join the International Renewable Energy Agency, the largest global intergovernmental organization promoting the deployment of renewable energy. 
Canada is working with its partners to ensure that international financial flows support climate-friendly development projects. Since January 2017, Export Development Canada has implemented the OECD Sector Understanding on Export Credits for Coal-Fired Electricity Generation Projects limiting export credit support for new coal-fired power plants. Canada is also active in the Powering Past Coal Alliance, which aims to accelerate clean growth and climate protection by rapidly phasing out traditional coal-fired electricity projects.  
Canada is also encouraging private investors and multilateral development banks to mainstream the promotion of womenis economic empowerment and equality of opportunity in energy access projects. Canadais Development Finance Institute, FinDev Canada (capitalized at $300 million), has mainstreamed womenis economic empowerment across its economic development and climate mandate. 
Canada is also working multilaterally to better position developing countries to receive investments in climate technology projects. The UNis Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN) provides capacity building and advice on policy, legal and regulatory frameworks tailored to the needs of individual countries so that technologies are more easily adopted. Canada has supported the work of the CTCN through a $2.5 million contribution in 2013 and again in 2016. Canada is also a member of the CTCNis advisory board and is working to encourage Canadian private-sector engagement in the Network. 
Canadais $2.65 billion commitment to help developing countries tackle climate change includes important investments in renewable energy. For example, Canada is providing 
$150 million to the African Renewable Energy Initiative to reduce emissions and improve access to energy by leveraging private sector investment. Canada is also providing $20M to promote the use of clean energy and access to efficient cookstoves in Haiti, particularly for women and girls.

Goal-by-goal actions
SDG 8: Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all

In Canada and around the world, the nature of work is changing. While Canada is experiencing strong economic growth and a historically low level of unemployment, its labour market is rapidly evolving due to globalization, new technologies, evolving business models and shifting demographics. Amid rapid change, Canadais prosperity and success will increasingly depend on developing innovative policies and programs to help all Canadians access goodquality jobs, decent wages and social protections, and create a culture of innovation, skills development and lifelong learning.  
Rising to the challenge
Supported by a plan that focuses on investment over austerity, the Canadian economy has been remarkably strong, leading G7 countries in GDP growth in 2017. Canadais strong economic growth has been driven significant investments in infrastructure, strong regional housing markets as well as supportive monetary and fiscal policy. Stronger global economic conditions contributed to a recovery in business investment and higher exports, and growth is shared more broadly across economic sectors and regions of Canada.

Since 2015, the Government has invested in the social and economic well-being of Canadians. For example:
\0xEF The new Canada Child Benefit is giving families more money to help with the cost of raising children and making it easier for them to afford the things that give children a good quality of life, such as a safe place to live, healthy food, summer programs and back-to-school clothes.
\0xEF The middle-class tax cut is benefitting nearly 9 million Canadians annually.
\0xEF The increase in the Guaranteed Income Supplement top-up is ensuring more seniors retire in security and in dignity. 
\0xEF Starting in 2019, the new Canada Workers Benefit will help Canadians take home more money while they work hard to join the middle class. 
\0xEF The Canada Infrastructure Bank is supporting larger, transformative infrastructure projects. 
\0xEF Innovative Solutions is encouraging growth that benefits everyone and procurement from women-led companies. The Government also committed significant funds to support women-led businesses, particularly those in the technology sector, through the Business Development Bank of Canada in 2015 and 2016.
Actions already taken have helped to lift more than half a million Canadians out of income poverty. The Government has also made historic, long-term investments in areas such as infrastructure, housing, clean water, health, transportation, and skills and employment that will help to promote sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all.
While all of these initiatives are driving Canadais growth, they are just a sample of the many measures taken to improve Canadais social infrastructure so that all Canadians have the social and economic supports needed to thrive as part of the middle class.  
Full and productive employment and decent work
Canada has made significant investments in its social and physical infrastructures and increased its efforts to support job creation, entrepreneurship and the growth of micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises. Hence, the Canadian economy grew strongly in 2017 (up 3.0%), leading all G7 nations, and is expected to maintain one of the highest GDP growths in the next two years. 
Canada has strong fiscal fundamentals: Canadais debt-toGDP ratio (30.4% in 2017-2018) is consistently declining and is projected to continue to do so, reaching 28.4% in 2022-2023. According to the International Monetary Fund, Canadais net debt-to-GDP ratio is by far the lowest among G7 countries and less than half the G7 average. 
The Canadian labour market is also performing well, with several indicators reaching record-high performance. Since November 2015, Canada created over 600,000 net new jobs and unemployment fell from 7.1% to 5.8%\0xF3its lowest level ever recorded. Canadais youth (aged 15 to 24) unemployment rate is below prerecession levels (11.1% in May 2018) and relatively close to its all-time low (10.4% in 1989). Despite being at historic lows, nearly 1 in 10 Canadian youth are not pursuing employment, education or training; young men are slightly more prevalent in this group. These youth run the risk of entering a cycle of poverty. 
Consistent with strong employment gains and an economy that is estimated to be operating close to potential, yearover-year growth in average weekly earnings accelerated sharply from about no growth in 2016 to close to 3.0% in recent months. Also, wages of the bottom 20% increased at a faster pace than the other wage quintiles over the past two years. 
Canada is committed to supporting the full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including for young people, persons with disabilities, newcomers to Canada and First Nations, Inuit and M\0xC8tis (see Supporting First Nations, Inuit and M\0xC8tis communities).

than others, even with a job. There are over one million Canadians who are working hard but are still living in poverty. Through the Canada Workers Benefit, beginning in 2019 lowerincome Canadians will get an added financial boost to the money they take home from work. The Government is also making it simpler and easier to get the Canada Workers Benefit: every qualifying worker who files a tax 
Governmentis commitment of making sure that all Canadians receive the tax benefits and credits to which they are entitled. In addition, the Government has also begun work to improve the delivery of the Canada Workers Benefit, to provide better support to lower-income Canadians throughout the year, rather than through an annual refund when they file their taxes.
Martha Justice Ministry of the Sisters of St. Martha, Antigonish 
The Martha Justice Ministry has a long history of involvement in social and ecological justice efforts in the community of Antigonish, Nova Scotia, and has played a key role in the people-centred movement for just and collectively directed livelihoods in rural Nova Scotia. The Marthas are involved in many community organizations at the grassroots level, working on initiatives that touch on all SDGs. Many Marthas have journeyed alongside people throughout their lives, contributing significantly to work centered in the development and dignity of persons through their careers in health care, education and social work. In Halifax, the Martha Street Ministry has allowed Sisters to work closely with people living on the street, standing with them to navigate systemic barriers that exclude them from healthy and sustainable housing and proper economic supports.
Measures to address pay equity through the introduction of legislation in 2018 will bring a proactive pay equity regime to federally regulated sectors, affecting approximately 1.2 million women. Women working full time earn 88 cents for every dollar of hourly wages earned by men, due to reasons that are deep-rooted and complex. Requiring equal pay for work of equal value is an effective way to address this gap. 
The Government has also focused on removing barriers to inclusion for persons with disabilities. Canadians living with disabilities deserve a better chance to succeed in their local communities and workplaces. The Government recently introduced the 
Federation of Canadian Municipalities 
The Federation of Canadian 
Municipalitiesi Community Economic Development Initiative focuses on enhancing the capacity of municipalities and adjacent First Nations to complete joint community economic development (CED) plans and strategies and develop long-term CED collaboration. The project is supporting 10 community partnerships, using a phased approach over three cycles from September 2016 to April 2021. 
The partnerships between First 
Nations and municipalities across Canada focus on joint initiatives on issues such as employment strategies, business parks and land-use planning, and mapping culturally significant sites to aid with tourism and improve public consultation.

Accessible Canada Act in Parliament with the purpose of ensuring a barrier-free Canada for all Canadians. Organizations in federal jurisdiction will be required to identify, remove and prevent accessibility barriers in the built environment, employment, information and communication technologies, the procurement of goods and services, the delivery of programs and services and transportation. 
Newcomers to Canada also face unique barriers to participating fully in their new country, including their ability to enter the workforce. When newcomers are unemployed or underemployed, newcomer 
families struggle financially and socially, and our economy loses out. To help remove these barriers, the Government is working with provinces and territories to support newcomersi employability, assist Canadian employers to fully benefit from the contribution of newcomers, and streamline and improve foreign qualification recognition.
In addition, in 2017-2018, the 
Government launched the Targeted Employment Strategy for Newcomers to help newcomers find jobs that suit their skills and experience. This includes the Foreign Credential Recognition Loans Program, which provides newcomers with loans to help cover credential recognition costs, such as licensing exams. The Government also introduced a new, 
3-year Visible Minority Newcomer 
Women Pilot (beginning in 20182019) to support programming for newcomer women who are also members of racialized communities. 
Getting a job is important but working conditions for employees are equally important. In addition to modernizing labour standards to provide new protections and flexibilities for workers, the Government is demonstrating leadership through the Canada Labour Code to give workers in federally regulated private sectors improved worknlife balance, such as the right to request flexible work arrangements, new unpaid leaves for family responsibilities, leave to participate in traditional Indigenous practices, seek care if they are victims of family violence and make bereavement leave more 
flexible. This added flexibility will help workers better manage work, family and personal responsibilities, which can always be a challenge in the busy lives of Canadians. A broader review of Part III (Federal Labour Standards) of the Canada Labour Code will ensure that Canadians can continue to benefit from a robust set of federal labour standards that respond to the realities of todayis workplaces and set the stage for good quality jobs.
The Government of Canada has also taken concrete measures to support those facing specific challenges and vulnerabilities by:
\0xEF Introducing legislation to create a more robust and integrated regime to protect employees from harassment and violence in federal workplaces.
\0xEF Enhancing protections for temporary foreign workersi rights, which were announced in 2018, including unannounced inspections. A pilot project will create a network of support organizations for temporary foreign workers dealing with potential abuse by their employers.
\0xEF Launching a national strategy against human trafficking at home and globally that will support measures to eradicate forced labour, end modern slavery and human trafficking, and secure the elimination of the worst forms of child labour.  
Taken together, all of these measures are there for Canadians because we believe that we are all better off when no one is left behind, and that all Canadians should share in our collective prosperity.
Canadais innovation economy
Canada is committed to be a worldleading innovation economy that will create jobs, benefit everyone and grow the middle-class by investing in infrastructure, skills, research, technology and commercialization; program simplification; investment and the scale-up of companies. The Government of Canada has created a new toolkit of policies, plans and programs to become a global centre for innovation, including:
\0xEF The Clean Growth Hub: a singlewindow service to streamline client services, improve federal program coordination, enable tracking and reporting on clean tech results across government, and connect stakeholders to international markets.
\0xEF Innovation Canada: a new platform to coordinate and simplify the support available to Canadais innovators. 
\0xEF Innovative Solutions Canada: a new procurement program for early stage research and development, late-stage prototypes from Canadian innovators and entrepreneurs.
\0xEF Innovation Superclusters Initiative: resources to support five business-led innovation \0xECsuperclusters that have the greatest potential to accelerate economic growth.
\0xEF Strategic Innovation Fund: open to all sectors, including clean technology, this fund supports company-led research and 

development and commercialization projects, firm expansion and growth, investment attraction and collaborative technology demonstration projects.
The Government has defined a new vision for Canada to position innovation as a catalyst for long-term sustainable economic growth and become a global centre for innovation. 
The goal is to work across the innovative ecosystem toward better outcomes: creating resilient jobs for the economy of today and tomorrow; developing a talented and skilled workforce; stimulating new investments to grow world-class companies; and to promote the development and adoption of new technologies.
Sustainable growth 
A clean environment and a strong economy go hand in hand. Canada has always been strengthened by its rich natural resources and set apart by its smart, diverse and creative population. The Governmentis economic growth strategy recognizes that a successful, innovative and clean Canadian economy will have a skilled and diverse workforce that leads the world, a strong and globally competitive private sector, leadingedge research and commercialization and a thriving investment community that supports innovative Canadian businesses. 
Canada is investing and growing targeted sectors and provides significant supports for clean tech research, development, demonstration and adoption to accelerate the growth of clean tech companies. Canada can be global leader in clean technology\0xF3creating good jobs for Canadians while helping to meet our climate change goals\0xF3and sets clear 
SDG indicator 8.5.2  Unemployment rate
and ambitious targets to increase the clean tech sectoris contribution to Canadais GDP and increase the number of clean tech companies in Canada.
The Governmentis 2017 Innovation and Skills Plan is an ambitious effort to make Canada a global centre for innovation and create a world-leading clean economy. The Plan focuses on implementing measures to deliver simpler, timely and more coordinated support to Canadian entrepreneurs and innovators so they can grow and succeed domestically and internationally. 
Investments have also been made to promote resource efficiency and endeavours to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation. Through collaborative projects across Canada based on mutual respect and cooperation, many First Nations, Inuit and M\0xC8tis communities have adopted innovative approaches to forest research, land-use planning, harvest decision making, product development and market access. These projects create long-term economic and community development opportunities, and safeguard culturally, spiritually and biologically important ecosystems.
SDG indicator 8.6.1  Proportion of youth (aged 15-24 years) not in education, employment or training

Consumer interest in buying locally produced foods and naturally sourced health products has spawned a major trend: foraged foods. To respond to this interest, Indigenous groups in Quebecis Abitibi-T\0xC8miscamingue region are researching the economic and market potential of a dozen non-timber forest products, including forest greens, berries and mushrooms. Community members, 
including youth, are training as harvesters. The communities plan to build a processing and freezing plant and create a business to sell and distribute local products. Important traditional knowledge will be transmitted from elders to youth.
Supporting First Nations, Inuit and M\0xC8tis communities 
Canada recognizes the inherent right of Indigenous peoples to selfgovernment; itis an existing right supported by the Constitution of Canada and the 94 Calls to Action of the 2015 Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission of Canada. The Commission also calls on the Government to work with Indigenous peoples to develop a joint strategy to eliminate educational and employment gaps between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Canadians. 
To help close the employment and earning gaps, the 2018 federal budget committed $2 billion over 5 years, and $408.2 million annually, to create the Indigenous Skills and Employment Training Program.6 The Program will focus on training for higher-quality, better-paying jobs rather than rapid re-employment, and provide services to ensure that Indigenous women have equal access to skills development and training opportunities. 
The Skills Partnership Fund is a proposal-based program to encourage partnering between stakeholders (e.g. training institutions, community organizations, local businesses and industry) and Indigenous organizations to support skills development, job training and employment supports for Indigenous people. Intended to address Indigenous socio-economic issues while meeting labour market demand, the Fund exceeded its target of 10,000 persons employed (from 2012-2013 to 2015-2016) and secured more than $250 million in financial commitments and in-kind support from approximately 450 partners.
Canada and the world
Inclusive, sustainable economic growth supported by inclusive governance and strong, accountable institutions is a key enabler of poverty reduction. When women develop to their full economic potential, economies thrive and the benefits of growth reach more people.
Through its Feminist International Assistance Policy, the Government of Canada is taking an integrated approach to promoting growth that works for everyone. Canadais international assistance promotes womenis voice and agency in economic decision making and seeks to mitigate and adapt to climate change through promoting stronger environmental governance, lower-carbon and climate-resilient economies and better environmental practices. Improved governance frameworks that support economic rights, labour standards and living wages are essential for all people to benefit from sustainable economic growth and reduce inequality.
Canada supports women and 
girls to ensure they develop their skills, accede to decision-making positions and fully participate in and benefit from their communitiesi economic growth, including support for technical and vocational training and entrepreneurship. Canada also promotes womenis social inclusion, labour rights, right to own property and access to financing. 
Broadly, the Government of Canadais international assistance focuses on:  
\0xEF Increasing the economic leadership and empowerment of women at all levels and promoting their economic rights and access to decent work; 
\0xEF Improving economic opportunities for and the resilience of rural women; 
\0xEF Promoting greater financial inclusion for women, including equal access to capital, markets, digital technologies, and business development services; 
\0xEF Addressing womenis unpaid work and the disproportionate burden of care they shoulder.
Canada is contributing $20 million to the World Bank Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative (We-Fi) to provide capital for women-owned and women-led small and medium size enterprises in developing countries. We-Fi aims to enable more than $1 billion in commercial and multilateral development bank financing and technical assistance to women-owned and women-led small and medium size enterprises around the world.


6 The Indigenous Skills and Employment Training Program will replace the Aboriginal Skills and Employment Training Strategy.
Empowering and improving economic opportunities for rural women in Senegal 

Women make up two thirds of Senegalis agricultural workers and are responsible for over 80% of food production. But they have limited access to land and adapted technologies, are more affected by poverty and malnutrition than men, and their unpaid work/care burden limits their money-making opportunities.
Canadais support enabled women farmers in Casamance, Senegal, to obtain innovative bee hives, specialized equipment and a fully equipped well. They learned new honey harvesting and processing techniques, leadership and administrative and financial management. In just a few years, the woman increased production and income, and diversified to include mangos, cashews and forest fruits. 
In all, 4,560 women gained knowledge of better-performing, forest-friendly agricultural technologies. Some created jobs, put their children through school, acquired betterbuilt houses, financed the rehabilitation of a communal well and bought desks for their school. The women have a more equal social position in their families and communities and engage in agri-food organizations and politics.
Next steps
\0xEF Canada is partnering with Indigenous governments, organizations, associations and communities to promote Canadais Progressive Trade Agenda, contributing to prosperity at home and abroad by supporting Canadian exporters and by expanding rulesbased, predictable market access. 
During 2011-2017, Global Affairs 
Canada provided $9.1 million to Kashf Foundation, a micro-finance institution in Pakistan, to provide financial literacy and business development services to women from poor households. Advocacy campaigns highlighted constraints faced by women in social and economic spheres, and raised awareness regarding a womanis right to participate in economic activities, and on the detrimental effects of early marriage and child sexual abuse. On average, women beneficiaries of the project increased their incomes by about 30% and their savings by 60%.
Furthermore, through its Progressive Trade Agenda, Canada is committed to supporting all segments of society in taking advantage of the economic opportunities flowing from trade and investment. Canada will contribute to inclusive prosperity through increased and diversified international trade and foreign direct investment. The Government will also pursue progressive approaches with trading partners in important areas such as transparency, labour rights, the environment, small and medium-sized enterprises, gender and Indigenous peoples.
\0xEF During the Canadais G7 Charlevoix Summit, leaders committed to \0xECSupport gender equality in labour market opportunities and in the distribution of unpaid care work, with measures such as paid maternity leave and parental leave, as well as initiatives to ensure womenis equal access to decent employment opportunities, leadership opportunities, resources and finance.
\0xEF In follow up to the G7 Employment and Innovation Ministerial in March 2018, Canada committed to host a conference with Canadian stakeholders to continue the dialogue to better position Canadians to be prepared for the opportunities and challenges that come with the future of work. One of the themes will be on closing the gender wage gap.

Goal-by-goal actions
SDG 9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation

Green infrastructure\0xF3including water and wastewater systems, clean energy, climate-resilient infrastructure like flood mitigation systems, and infrastructure to protect against a changing climate\0xF3protects the natural environment, strengthens the health of communities, supports economic growth and improves the quality of life. 
Canadian industry has always been strengthened by Canadais rich natural resources, as well as its diverse, creative, hard-working and well-educated population. Canadian workers, however, face a rapidly changing economy that will have a profound impact on the nature of work and jobs of the future. To be equipped for this change, there is a critical need for Canada to rethink its approach to learning, work and training. 
Canada typically spends 3% of GDP annually on public infrastructure. A growing portion of public infrastructure is managed by municipal governments. 
Rising to the challenge
A clean environment and a strong economy go hand-in-hand. To help advance Canadais efforts to build a clean economy, the Government of Canadais long-term Investing in 
Canada Plan will provide more than $180 billion in infrastructure funding.
Over the 12 years of the Plan, from 2016, the Government will more than double existing federal funding to generate long-term economic growth, help improve the resilience of communities, transition to a clean growth economy and improve social inclusion and socio-economic outcomes for all Canadians.

Significant investments will be made in priorities such as access to safe water and clean air, affordable housing and child care, clean electricity grid interconnections, trade and transportation infrastructure, rural and northern infrastructure, and new urban transit networks. As outlined in Canadais Federal Sustainable Development Strategy, by the end of 2025-2026 the Government of Canada aims to invest $20 billion in funding for green infrastructure initiatives that reduce GHG emissions and improve climate resilience and environmental quality.
Canada has one of the best housing systems in the world. But some 1.7 million families still do not have a home that meets their basic needs. Through Canadais National Housing Strategy, the Government will invest more than $11.2 billion in a range of initiatives designed to build, renew and repair Canadais stock of affordable housing and help to ensure that Canadians have adequate and affordable housing that meets their needs. This includes $225 million to improve housing conditions for Indigenous people not living on reserve.
Canadais Innovation and Skills Plan is the centerpiece of the Governmentis economic growth strategy and focuses fundamentally on people. Innovative products, ideas or services only become real because of the creativity, work ethic and skill of the people who create them. The Innovation and Skills Plan will help to grow the economy, create middleclass jobs and provide Canadians with the skills they need to succeed. For example, the Connect to Innovate program will invest $500 million by 2021 to bring high-speed internet to more than 700 rural and remote communities in Canada. Federal investments are also supporting affordable access to the internet for low-income families, digital literacy and better access to assistive devices. 
The Government of Canada invests more than $2 billion every year to help more unemployed and underemployed Canadians access the training and employment supports they need to find and keep good jobs in the new economy. Labour market development agreements between the Government of Canada and the provinces and territories are part of Canadais major initiative to modernize the way training and employment supports are funded, by increasing 
City of Kitchener 
The City of Kitchener recently approved Digital Kitchener, a strategy with strong links to the SDGs. As part of Digital Kitchener, the City installed smart LED street lights, which have sensors to brighten as needed, based on the amount of daylight, throughout the year. Eventually, the sensors will contribute to data collection as part of smart infrastructure. Digital Kitchener also established a goal of being more inclusive. Working with partners like the Kitchener Public Library and other local groups, the City of Kitchener will help lay the framework for digital programs and standards that make it easier for everyone to access information across the city.
access, improving outcomes and making the system simpler, more flexible and responsive to the needs of Canadians. 
The Government of Canada is also committed to help support women and under-represented groups reach their full potential and advance their economic participation as part of a strong and growing economy. 
During Canadais 2018 G7 presidency, employment and innovation ministers convened under the theme of Preparing for Jobs of the Future. Globalization and emerging technologies are compelling G7 members to understand how the changing economy is affecting industries and workers and how governments can support their citizens to adapt and thrive in the new world of work. 

SDG 9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation SDG 9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation

Gender equality and womenis empowerment were key underlying themes during the meeting. This included a focus on closing the gender gap by supporting more women to pursue careers in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics; boosting womenis participation in the labour market, particularly in leadership roles; and recognizing equality of rights and opportunities for women and men. 
In support of the objective to double the number of women-owned businesses by 2025, Canadais recently announced Womenis Entrepreneurship Strategy will help women entrepreneurs grow their businesses through better access to financing, mentorship, expertise and federal government innovation programs. Canada is also advancing legislation (Bill C-25) to amend the Canada Business Corporations Act to require publicly traded corporations to disclose information on the diversity makeup of their boards and their diversity policies.
Engagement
Basic infrastructure needs that most Canadians take for granted are missing in many Indigenous communities. To address these gaps, the Government of Canada is working with First Nations governments and communities to support the adequate and sustainable housing, clean drinking water and community infrastructure such as schools, roads and wastewater systems that are essential to healthy, safe and prosperous communities. 
Through its Investing in Canada Plan, the Government of Canada will support the construction and improvement of housing, water treatment systems, health facilities and other community infrastructure in partnership with Indigenous peoples.
When it comes to infrastructure deficits in First Nations, Inuit and M\0xC8tis communities, many challenges remain. Predictable, long-term funding is essential but will not suffice for long-term solutions. To that end, in collaboration with Indigenous partners, the Government is working to: develop housing strategies for First Nations, Inuit and M\0xC8tis; lift all long-term drinking water advisories for public systems on reserve by March 
Pender Solar Initiative 2020 
2021; and ensure communities are supported by Indigenous institutions with the financing, procurement and maintenance of public infrastructure.    
The Innovation and Skills Plan recognizes that together we are stronger. The Plan is founded on a partnership that spans the innovation ecosystem and includes the private sector, research institutions, universities, colleges, not-for-profit organizations and Indigenous organizations. Its development was based on extensive engagement with Canadians and the work of the Economic Growth Council. 
One example of Canadais engagement with stakeholders on innovation and skills development is the Pan-Canadian Artificial Intelligence Strategy, which the Government of Canada funds to cement Canadais position as a world leader in artificial intelligence. The $125 million strategy will attract and retain top academic talent in Canada, increase the number of post-graduate trainees and researchers studying artificial intelligence, and promote collaboration between Canadais main centres of expertise in Edmonton, Montr\0xC8al and TorontonWaterloo.  

The Pender Solar Initiative 2020 works to raise money, design solar photovoltaic rooftop systems and install them on the roofs of all public buildings on Pender Island, British Columbia, by 2020. In their efforts to participate in solving global climate change, they recognize solar electricity as a clean, green solution. To date, they have installed rooftop solar electricity generating systems on the recycling depot, library, community hall and school with almost $200,000 raised on an island of 2,500 residents. The recycling depot generates more electricity than it uses, so instead of paying a utility bill, it receives a payment from the utility. Revenue from the school project funds a scholarship program for Pender youth.

Canada and the world
The global ambition to eradicate extreme poverty as outlined in the 2030 Agenda will not succeed with business-as-usual approaches. Ground-breaking improvements are needed to service delivery, products, policies, partnerships and funding modalities, including publicnprivate cooperation. Tackling the barriers to gender equality and empowering women and adolescent girls can have a transformative impact when incorporated into new partnerships and solutions. Canadais Feminist International Assistance Policy commits to building innovation into our international assistance programming.
In 2018, Canada used its G7 presidency to convene ministers responsible for development cooperation to discuss pressing global development and humanitarian challenges, including accelerating 
innovation for development impact. Ministers committed to working together to drive and support pioneering solutions to improve the lives of the poorest and most-vulnerable people. This work includes promoting inclusive innovation, investing in locally driven solutions, encouraging smart risktaking, adopting new program and policy approaches, using data to drive decision-making, identifying scalable solutions, and supporting gender-responsive mechanisms and knowledge sharing. To that end, G7 ministers endorsed the Whistler Principles to Accelerate Innovation for Development Impact. 
Canada has a long history of supporting developing countriesi efforts to build resilient infrastructure for coastal communities. Efforts in this area include the provision of $2.65 billion to support developing countriesi transition to lowercarbon, climate-resilient economies until 2020-2021, and the pledge of $100 million for reconstruction and climate resilience efforts in hurricaneaffected Caribbean countries. 

SDG indicator 9.5.2  Researchers (in full-time equivalent) per million inhabitants

As G7 president for 2018, Canada announced that it will invest $162 million to build stronger and more resilient coasts and communities. This funding includes $100 million to support the expansion of Climate Risk Insurance coverage in climate-vulnerable countries, including for small island developing states (SIDS), and $60 million to support the expansion of their clean energy systems and infrastructure, improve energy access for women and girls in SIDS, and provide training and employment opportunities for women in non-traditional, sustainable technology sectors. Also included in this funding is $2 million to support efforts by developing countries to adapt to the impacts of climate change.

Goal-by-goal actions
SDG 10: Reduce inequality within and among countries

Reducing inequality, promoting diversity and providing all people with the opportunity to reach their full potential is not only the right thing to do, it is also the smart thing to do to create a growing economy that benefits everyone. Diversity in Canada
Canada is widely recognized as an inclusive, diverse, respectful multiethnic and multi-faith society with:
\0xEF 2 official languages, English and French
\0xEF more than 200 ethnic origins and languages
\0xEF 20.6% of its population is  foreign-born
\0xEF religious diversity 
\0xEF approximately 1.7 million Indigenous people who account for 5% of the total population, as of 2016
\0xEF 72,880 same-sex couples, as of 
2016
 Canada has learned how to be strong not in spite of our differences, but because of them, and going forward, that capacity will be at the heart of both our success, and of what we offer the world. Our commitment to diversity and inclusion isnit about Canadians being nice and polite\0xF3 though of course we are. In fact, this commitment is a powerful and ambitious approach to making Canada, and the world, a better, and safer, place.

wage quintiles, while the fourth (0.0%) and fifth (+0.1%) wage quintiles had practically no growth. 
The market income share of the bottom 90% of income earners declined moderately from 67.8% in 1982 to 59.9% in 2015. However, their market income share has not changed substantially since 2000, with a low of 59.7% in 2007 and a high of 60.8% for each year between 2000 and 2003. Nevertheless, this means that the top 10% of income earners have made a substantial gain in their share of market income since the 1980s. 
This diversity is celebrated and is our source of strength. Canadais cultural, political and economic strength is because of our diversity, not despite it. Canada is experiencing increasing migration, globalization and changing demographics, which can create great opportunities but also give rise to increased fear, insecurity and inequality\0xF3putting many Canadians at risk of falling behind.  
Inequality in Canada
Like many other countries, income inequality in Canada is currently at a high level by historical standards. As measured by the Gini coefficient7, market income8 inequality increased sharply with recessions in the early 1980s and early 1990s but did not decrease over the periods of growth that followed. In addition, after-tax income inequality increased sharply starting in the second half of the 
at 0.306, an improvement from 2015is 0.314. In addition, between 2015 and 2017, real average hourly wage growth accelerated across all wage quintiles (average annual growth: 0.94%) and the lowest wage quintile maintained its lead in terms of growth rates. In 2017, the bottom wage quintile had the highest real hourly wage growth (+1.8%) of all 
For Canadais top 1%, their share of market income went from 7.6% in 1982 to a peak of 13.6% in 2006, before dropping over the 2008-2009 recession and returning to late 1990s levels (12.8% in 2015). 
Looking at the net worth (assets less debts) of Canadians also reveals disparities. Although the most recent data shows that the median net

Furthermore, the 2016 after-tax Gini coefficient for Canada is estimated Figure 10.1 Adjusted market income and after-tax income in Canada (Gini, 1976-2016)


7 The Gini coefficient is the most common population-wide measure of income inequality. Gini coefficients range between 0 (complete equality) and 1 (complete inequality).
8 Market income is generally income from earnings, investments, pensions, spousal support payments and other taxable income. It does not capture redistributive effects from taxes and transfers.

worth of all Canadians is positive and increasing (going from $257,200 in 2012 to $295,100 in 2016), the situation is dramatically different when focusing specifically on Canadians with low or modest incomes. In 2016, the median net worth of Canadians in the bottom 20% in terms of aftertax income was $11,000\0xF3more than 
10 times less than the net worth of Canadians in the second highest quintile ($156,300). In addition, the median value of consumer debts held by Canadians in the bottom 20% has also recently increased, going from $8,800 in 2012 to $10,500 in 2016.9
Despite such indications of stagnating or rising inequality, the median aftertax income of Canadian families has substantially increased since 2000, going from $47,900 to $57,000 in 2016. 
Specific groups of Canadians are more likely to have low incomes: single people aged 45 to 64, lone parents, recent immigrants, people with disabilities and Indigenous people not living on reserve. (Lowincome data is not available for 
Indigenous people living on reserve but living conditions and statistics on educational and employment outcomes suggest that the poverty rate on reserve is higher than off reserve.) 
Despite progress over several decades, women in Canada remain under-represented in politics and leadership roles, earn less than men and experience high rates of harassment and gender-based violence\0xF3nearly 1 in 3 women experienced sexual harassment in the workplace. Certain groups face particular and disproportionate obstacles, including Indigenous, newcomer and migrant, and rural women and girls, women and girls with a disability, and LGBTQ2 and non-binary persons.
Discrimination is another dimension of inequity faced by some Canadians belonging to specific groups. In a 2014 survey on Canadiansi safety, 17% of immigrants reported experiencing discrimination in the previous five years, compared with 12% of

Egale contributes to SDG 10 in its efforts to reduce global inequality through police and judicial training in developing countries that includes best practices in sexual orientation and gender identity. 
Canadian-born respondents. Policereported hate crimes in Canada rose modestly between 2015 and 2016, up 47 to 1409 incidents; 48% were motivated by hatred of race or ethnicity and 13% targeted sexual orientation. 
Current gaps in data on gender, race and other intersecting identities is a challenge for evidence-based decision making, including the ability to understand and address the barriers different groups face, and how to track and measure progress. In 2018, the Government of Canada announced measures to increase the availability and reliability of gender and diversity data, including the creation of a Centre for Gender, Diversity and Inclusion Statistics.


9 The vast majority of debt held by Canadians consists of mortgages, which typically have lower interest rates than credit cards or other loans. Mortgages represented 73% of the total debt held by the bottom 20% in the after-tax income distribution and 80.7% of debts held by all Canadians.

Rising to the challenge 
Governments in Canada are empowering Canadians in all their diversity to help build a stronger country that benefits everyone. Closing gaps and giving all Canadians equal opportunities to succeed will foster strong economic growth and improve the quality of life for families and communities. 
Many Canadians struggle to get ahead because of barriers beyond their control, such as discrimination or unacceptable prejudices based on the colour of their skin or their sexual orientation. Indigenous people face often long-standing challenges rooted in Canadais colonial history that have marginalized generations. It cannot be said that persons with disabilities have the same level of opportunity and inclusion as other Canadians when physical spaces are simply not accessible to them. Newcomers to Canada often face multiple challenges with moving up, such as learning a new language and finding work. Challenges can be particularly severe when these attributes intersect for an individual, for example, a black Canadian woman who also lives with a disability.
In the context of rising inequality, Canada focuses on ensuring that opportunity, growth and prosperity benefits are felt by all Canadians, including through strengthening social protection programs and creating more fairness in the tax system. The new Canada Child Benefit is giving families more money to help with the cost of raising children and making it easier for them to afford the things that give children a good quality of life, such as a safe place to live, healthy food, summer programs and backto-school clothes. The increase in the Guaranteed Income Supplement top-up is ensuring more seniors retire in comfort and in dignity. And starting in 2019, the new Canada Workers Benefit will help Canadians take home more money while they work. Indeed, more than half a million Canadians have already been lifted out of poverty by these measures. In addition, the Government has made longer-term investments to address the multiple dimensions of poverty in areas such as housing, home care and mental health services, public transit, and skills training and employment programs.  Gender equality
Advancing gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls is a key priority for Canada. The Government appointed the first federal minister fully dedicated to gender issues and the first genderbalanced federal Cabinet, inviting diverse perspectives to the Cabinet table. Canada is developing legislation to ensure that employees in federally regulated workplaces receive equal pay for work of equal value. 
Canada works with provincial and territorial partners to make early learning and child care more flexible, inclusive and affordable across the country, which helps families balance work and family responsibilities and gives more women a choice about participating in the workforce. 
The Government recognizes that a country where everyone has a fair and equal chance at success means that parents should have the supports they need to balance family and work responsibilities and be resilient through life changes. That is why Canada has proposed a new Parental Sharing benefit to promote more equal distribution of family responsibilities between spouses. 
GBA+ in action 

Nine out of 10 Canadian families are receiving more money under the Canada Child Benefit, which is particularly beneficial for low-income single mothers.
The recent increase to Employment Insurance parental leave by up to five weeks, in cases where the second parent agrees to take a minimum of five weeks of parental leave, will help improve the sharing of caregiving responsibilities by both parents.
Increased Guaranteed Income 
Supplement payments of up to 
$947 per year are helping nearly 900,000 low income seniors, 70% of whom are women.
The new National Housing Strategy will support vulnerable populations, aiming for a target of 33% of investments to support projects that target the unique needs of women and girls.
Greater funding to improve the health of First Nations and Inuit includes services that are women-specific, such as maternal and child health.
Canada is strongly committed to achieving gender equality. This can be seen in many of its actions, such as its strategy on Gender-Based Violence, its commitment to introducing pay equity legislation, and Budget 2018, where no decision was taken without being informed by GBA+. As well, many recent investments, such as the introduction of the Canada Child Benefit and the increase in the Guaranteed Income Supplement payments for low-income seniors, are particularly beneficial to women.  

The creation of a new Centre for 
Gender, Diversity and Inclusion Statistics at Statistics Canada will help track the Governmentis progress toward a more equal society. It will improve our understanding of the barriers faced by different groups, such as women racialized communities and LGBTQ2 communities, and how best to support them with evidence-based policy. The Centre will maintain a public-facing GBA+ data hub to support evidence-based policy development and decision making\0xF3 both within the federal government and beyond. Immigration
Newcomers to Canada also face unique barriers to participating fully in their new country, including their ability to work. When newcomers are unemployed or underemployed, the Canadian economy loses out and newcomer families struggle financially and emotionally. To help remove these barriers, the Government is working with provinces and territories to support newcomersi employability, assist Canadian employers to fully benefit from the newcomer labour force and streamline and improve foreign qualification recognition.
Canadais national migration system includes temporary and permanent pathways for work at all skills levels, for study, for family unification, as well as refugee resettlement programs. Whereas temporary resident applications are processed according to demand, Canada establishes annual targets for admissions of new permanent residents to Canada, which are tabled in Parliament. In November 2017, Canada released a multi-year immigration levels plan to responsibly grow the number 
of permanent residents Canada welcomes annually, including economic immigration, sponsored family members and refugees. This measured and gradual increase will trend toward 1% of Canadais population by 2020.
Ensuring that newcomers integrate into and contribute to our economy and our communities is a key priority. To this end, the Government works closely with provincial, territorial and municipal governments, private sponsors and NGOs to provide settlement and integration supports to newcomers, including language training, employment assistance and activities aimed at fostering social connections within communities. The Government is further committed to encouraging all permanent residents to acquire Canadian citizenship and benefit from permanently belonging in Canadian society.
To ensure that Canada maximizes the benefits of immigration, Canada is committed to evidence-based decision making and regularly conducts evaluations of Canadais immigration programs and policies, testing innovative approaches through pilot programs, as well as sharing best practices and learning from others.
Racial and religious minorities
Interventions to address racism by all levels of government aim to raise awareness through media and education and in health-care settings. To help address systemic barriers of racism, the Government will launch cross-country consultations on a new national anti-racism approach. The plan will bring together experts, community organizations, citizens and interfaith leaders to find new ways to collaborate and combat discrimination, and would dedicate increased funds to address racism and discrimination targeting Indigenous peoples, as well as women and girls.
As a first step toward recognizing the significant and unique challenges faced by Black Canadians, the Government will also fund local community supports for youth at risk and to develop research in support of more culturally focused mental health programs in the Black Canadian community. Through the Multiculturalism Funding Program, the Government of Canada supports projects that encourage positive interaction between cultural, religious and ethnic communities. In 20162017, it funded more than 200 such community-led events. 
NewToBC 
NewToBC partners with public libraries and immigrant service providers to develop, deliver and raise awareness about services and resources that support the settlement and integration of immigrants and refugees and that promote culturally diverse, inclusive and welcoming communities in British Columbia. NewToBC operates the Library Champions Project, which is a volunteer outreach program for new immigrants. More than 1000 new immigrants have been trained as library champions, and these individuals have reached out to more than 63,000 other new immigrants. 
Provincial governments are also taking action:
\0xEF Ontariois 2017 Anti-Racism Act focuses on eliminating systemic racism and advancing racial equity. Subsequent anti-racism strategies help the most-vulnerable populations, including in the child welfare, education and justice sectors.
\0xEF Quebecis new policy on immigration, participation and inclusion recognizes discrimination and racism as barriers to full participation in society. Its action strategy includes concrete measures to prevent and combat discrimination and racism.
Supporting the LGBTQ2 community 
To create a stronger, more diverse and more inclusive society, Canada is taking important steps to respond to the historical and ongoing inequality faced by Canadais LGBTQ2 communities. In November 2016, the Government appointed a special advisor on LGBTQ2 issues whose principal role is to work with LGBTQ2 organizations from across the country to promote equality for the LGBTQ2 community, protect the rights of its members and address discrimination\0xF3both historical and current\0xF3against them. This builds on the Governmentis introduction in May 2016 and passage into law in June 2017 of historic legislation (Bill C-16) to recognize and reduce the vulnerability of trans and other gender-diverse persons to discrimination, hate propaganda and hate crimes, and to affirm their equal status in Canadian society. 
Prime Minister Trudeau also issued a formal apology, in 2017, to individuals harmed by federal legislation, policies and practices that led to the oppression of and discrimination against LGBTQ2 people in Canada. 
At the provincial and territorial level, all governments added gender identity, gender expression or both as prohibited grounds of discrimination to their anti-discrimination legislation.  
with Disabilities and Workforce Development Agreements. The programs assist persons with disabilities to prepare for, obtain and maintain employment. 
All jurisdictions in Canada have a broad range of policies, programs and initiatives that provide support to persons with disabilities and their families and promote their inclusion and full participation in Canadian society.  
Persons with disabilities 
Accessible Canada Act 

To ensure greater accessibility and opportunities for Canadians with disabilities, the Government of Canada has introduced the Accessible Canada Act, which will identifiy and remove barriers for persons with disabilities, and support broader societal awareness and behaviour change. This legislation was informed by significant consultations with governments, organizations and thousands of Canadians with the purpose of ensuring a barrier-free Canada.
Canada is focused on removing barriers to inclusion for persons with disabilities. Canadians living with disabilities deserve a better chance to succeed in their local communities and workplaces. In June 2018, the Government introduced accessibility legislation in Parliament that will promote equality of opportunity by helping remove barriers and prevent new barriers from being created for persons with disabilities in the federal jurisdiction.
Canada supports employment programs for persons with disabilities through two primary mechanisms, the Opportunities Fund for Persons 
Halifax Regional Municipality Office of Diversity and Inclusion 
The Office of Diversity and Inclusion connects the Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM) with Indigenous, African Nova Scotian, immigrant and other racialized communities to ensure consultation with those groups, to ensure theyire kept informed of programs and services offered by the municipality. The Office also holds training and awareness sessions for all employees to ensure that diversity and inclusion remain integral values of HRM policies and practices. As part of its initiatives, HRM works with the African Nova Scotian and Racially Visible Womenis Network, meeting quarterly to share knowledge, professional skills and set goals for individual and collective growth. They also work with the Racially Visible Employee Caucus, which offers employment and professional advancement support and guidance to racially visible employees.

Supporting First Nations, Inuit and M\0xC8tis communities
The 2030 Agenda seeks to \0xECleave no one behind, which echoes \0xECnothing about us, without us for the approximately 1.7 million Indigenous people in Canada. We cannot speak of reducing inequalities without recognizing and addressing the systemic barriers that render First Nations, Inuit and M\0xC8tis among the most at-risk, marginalized and underserved members of Canadian society. 
The 2018 federal budget expands on significant investments in the previous two budgets and takes further steps toward reconciliation by investing in priority areas identified by First Nations, Inuit and M\0xC8tis partners. Critical investments are being made to ensure that Indigenous communities have what almost all other Canadians enjoy: clean drinking water, adequate housing and access to education and health services.  
Canada and the world 
Canada is recognized for its role in promoting values of diversity, inclusion and human rights for all, and for its relentless focus on all those who face exclusion and discrimination. Canada is committed to \0xECleaving no one behind and believes this is best achieved through the promotion and support of inclusive societies that recognize and celebrate diversity and support equality.
Canada and Chile co-chair the Equal Rights Coalition (ERC), a partnership of countries, civil society organizations and multilateral agencies. The ERC promotes full and equal enjoyment of rights by LGBTI persons worldwide, including through joint diplomatic action and coordination of development policy and funding. Canada will host the ERCis 2018 global conference in August. 
Inequality is increasingly an important issue in the digital space. Canadais IDRC supports work to understand how platforms are shaping and disrupting work, learning, communication and engagement, as well as their parallel impact on inclusion, equity and power.
Canada works to strengthen Indigenous rights globally through development programming and bilateral and multilateral advocacy, and announced its full support for the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in 2016.
Rapid technological change is reshaping power relationships and has an important impact on equality. Canada has been at the forefront of efforts to ensure that digital dimensions of human rights are considered in multilateral forums and that the rights people have offline are also protected online. One of the outcomes of the G7 Leadersi Summit was the Charlevoix Comitment to End Sexual and Gender-Based Violence, 
Abuse and Harassment in Digital Contexts. The Summit also produced principles for guiding the development and adoption of Artificial Intelligence in a gender-sensitive and inclusive manner to avoid harmful bias and discrimination.    
The Human Rights Council Canadaled resolution on Eliminating Violence against Women and Girls, focused this year on preventing and responding to violence in digital contexts, was tabled on June 28, 2018. Furthermore, Canada is actively engaged in the Freedom Online Coalition, where it seeks to ensure that digital technologies and spaces (platforms) remain inclusive and human rights respecting.  
Finally, on June 6, 2018, Canada committed to creating an international study group with France on inclusive and ethical Artificial Intelligence (AI), with the objective to engage experts in all sectors of society and areas of research globally to better understand how to develop AI technologies that benefit all. Canadais International Development Research Centre supports work to understand how information and communications technology is shaping and disrupting work, learning, communication and engagement, as well as their parallel impact on inclusion, equity and power.
Migrants contribute to society best when they have regular status, are meaningfully included in communities and work in the formal economy, thus helping to reduce inequalities. The Government of Canada played an active role in the negotiation of the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, which set 
out separate processes to create two non-binding international instruments in 2018: the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (GCM) and the Global Compact on Refugees. Canada has worked closely with international partners on negotiations with a view to adopting the GCM in December 2018, which Canada believes will help strengthen the contribution of migration to sustainable development. Canada is also providing diplomatic and financial support to the office of the Special Representative for International Migration, Louise Arbour, which is responsible for coordinating the UN systemis work on international migration and supporting the discussions on the GCM.
Trade has been a driver of economic growth and prosperity around the world. However, Canada is aware of criticisms of international trade and globalization, of the view that not all share in or recognize the economic growth benefits, and, therefore, the need to work toward meaningful ways to address these concerns. That is why Canada has been pursuing its Progressive Trade Agenda, which seeks to ensure that all segments of society can take advantage of and otherwise benefit from the opportunities that flow from trade and investment. This agenda is informed by ongoing dialogue with a broad range of Canadians, including those that have traditionally been underrepresented, including women, youth, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and Indigenous peoples. The Progressive Trade Agenda also seeks to ensure that more Canadians benefit from increased trade and investment by including provisions in trade agreements in important areas such as transparency, labour rights, the environment, SMEs and gender. Most recently, the provisional application of the Canada-EU CETA and the modernization of the Canada-Chile FTA are examples of how progressive approaches can be included in trade agreements.
Canada targets international assistance to affect the lives of the poorest and most vulnerable, including those living in fragile contexts. Canada is also adapting to better respond to local needs and opportunities. Canadais Feminist International Assistance Policy seeks to eradicate poverty and build a more peaceful, more inclusive and more prosperous world. Canadais feminist approach fights the root causes of poverty that can affect everyone: inequality and exclusion. The policy adopts an integrated approach to international assistance though six action areas that are also essential to attaining SDG 10. For example, the \0xECinclusive governance action area is fundamental to ensuring that development benefits the poorest, most marginalized and most vulnerable, thus helping to reduce inequalities. 
Canadais 2018 G7 presidency includes a strong focus on economic cooperation and growth that works for everyone. This yearis G7 Summit focused on innovative and gender responsive solutions to address common challenges such as persistent poverty and inequality.
The personal impact of humanitarian crises can be affected by gender, age and disability. Canada is an active member of the Global Action on Disability Network, which seeks to enhance the inclusion of persons with disabilities in international development and humanitarian action, and Canada endorsed the 2016 Charter on Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities in Humanitarian Action.  
Next steps
\0xEF The Government of Canada is committed to building a fair and inclusive society by giving all Canadians opportunities to succeed, while also providing targeted support for those facing particular barriers such as people living in poverty and underrepresented groups, including Indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities, LGBTQ2, youth, new immigrants (those who have landed in Canada within the last 5 years) and older persons.
\0xEF Canada is taking a number of measures to enhance the lives of its citizens and ensure continued support for growth the benefits all. For example, the Government of Canada is working with provinces and territories to reduce poverty by providing funding through the Canada Social Transfer, which is legislated to increase by over $2 billion in 2021-2022.
\0xEF The Government of Canada is also committed to ensuring that the policy development process itself promotes social inclusion. The Government will continue to engage with Canadians to support the development of public policies on issues such as housing and homelessness, poverty reduction and promoting accessibility for persons with disabilities.

Goal-by-goal actions
SDG 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable

Cities are vital contributors to Canadais prosperity and overall standard of living, places where dynamic economic, cultural and social exchanges converge to support our economic performance and social progress. A growing number of Canadians, currently more than 82%, live in cities and surrounding metropolitan areas. As key engines for the knowledge economy, Canadian cities are competing globally for people, technological leadership and capital investment. Municipal leaders need to plan for economic growth in this competitive environment, at the same time ensuring that their communities are safe and livable, provide opportunities and a positive quality of life for diverse, growing populations, and manage a built environment that is under continual pressure to grow and improve while addressing the pressing issues of climate change and environmental sustainability more generally. The challenges of urban mobility and social inclusion illustrate some of the dynamics at stake:
\0xEF Urban mobility: Canadian cities are among the most livable and business friendly communities in the world, but they are facing an urgent set of issues when it comes to a fundamental feature of urban living: getting around. Congestion is expensive and a drain on productivity. By some estimates, congestion in Canadais largest cities costs between $3.1 billion and $4.6 billion annually. Further, the number of registered light motor vehicles in Canada has been increasing at a faster rate than Canadais population, at 36% compared to 19% (from 1999 to 2016) and the vast majority of 

commuters still use cars to get to/ from work. This motor dependency and worsening congestion is a challenge for ensuring sustainable growth that benefits everyone in Canadian cities. 
\0xEF Social inclusion: As Canadian communities grow, maintaining and broadening the benefits of that growth for all residents is a key challenge. Housing prices in major urban centres in Canada have been increasing significantly in recent years. This puts considerable pressure on the disposable income of many families and has forced an increasing number of persons to look for housing further and further from the core services and opportunities of Canadais cities. This outward sprawl not only raises issues of fairness and equality of 
The Government of Canada works to ensure cities and communities are inclusive settings for shared economic growth and environmental sustainability. Investing in affordable housing, efficient public transit and strategies for GHG mitigation, adaptation and resiliency to a changing climate will continue making Canadian cities desirable places to live, and well prepared to meet these future challenges.
The Government of Canada also recognizes the importance of ensuring cities and communities are inclusive settings for newcomers to Canada, including refugees, to help ensure their effective 
City of North Vancouver 
integration into Canadian society. To this end, Canada supports Local Immigration Partnerships, which connect municipal governments, service provider organizations, public institutions and employers to improve planning and coordinating of services for newcomers.
While the majority of core public infrastructure is owned by provincial, territorial and municipal governments, collaboration among decision makers at all levels, including nation-to-nation relationships with Indigenous peoples, makes cities and communities more livable and sustainable. 
At the federal level, the Government of Canada is making a historic infrastructure investment. This $180-billion investment over 12 years will support local priorities and be delivered to public transit, social infrastructure, green infrastructure, and rural and northern communities.  
Rising to the challenge
Sustainable homes and buildings
Safe and affordable housing is the cornerstone of inclusive and sustainable communities. Canada introduced its $40 billion, 10-year National Housing Strategy in 2017 

opportunity, but places pressures on the environment and funding for infrastructure and government services. Managing the growth of cities and addressing key issues like the location, quality and affordability of housing, accessible and affordable public transportation and equality of access to services and economic opportunities all play a key role in enabling healthy and resilient communities.  
In 2009, the City of North Vancouver developed a 100-year sustainability vision with a view to becoming a net zero community by 2107. With the opportunity to reduce emissions by as much as 30% through land-use decisions alone, the implementation of this vision accommodates growth through adherence to the following key design principles: homes are a 5-minute walking distance to services, jobs are close to homes, appropriate housing, access to greenspace, durable green infrastructure, and climate change adaptation. Projects to date include street tree planting, walkto-school initiatives and building retrofits. Funds are targeted directly to specific, local programs, which would otherwise not be possible.

to enable more Canadians to have a place to call home by promoting diverse communities and building housing that is fully integrated\0xF3close to transit, work and public services\0xF3 into the community. Inclusion, participation, accountability and non-discrimination guide the Strategy to prioritize investments for the most-vulnerable Canadians: women and children fleeing family violence, Indigenous people, seniors, persons with disabilities, people living with mental health and addiction issues, veterans and young adults. 
Investments also support Canadais commitment to accessible communities and, with buildings and homes accounting for 17% of Canadais GHG emissions, support our climate change agenda. For example, Build Smart: Canadais Buildings Strategy ($182 million over 
8 years) aims to make new homes and buildings more efficient, retrofit existing homes and buildings and improve the energy efficiency of appliances and equipment used. Indigenous people and communities
More than half of Indigenous people in Canada live in urban centres. Offreserve Indigenous people are the fastest-growing segment of Canadian society. They move to urban centres for education and employment opportunities, and the urban lifestyle, but Indigenous people are often unable to access the supports needed to succeed in this difficult transition from living in remote and isolated reserves. 
The Urban Programming for Indigenous Peoples initiative was established in 2017 to assist Indigenous people living in or transitioning to urban centres. It provides funding for Indigenous organizations that deliver transition services, outreach programs and community wellness programs to urban Indigenous women, youth and vulnerable populations. 
Building on existing regional strategies and best practices, the Government of Canada partners with Indigenous peoples to support the building of effective and sustainable Indigenous communities, governments and services. The Indigenous Community Development National Strategy supports the implementation of community-driven, nationbased development and planning initiatives that engage and empower communities to express their own strengths and visions for the future.

Public transit system improvements contribute to achieving national economic and environment goals. Improvements in Canadian public transit systems support the transition to a lower-carbon economy and reduce air pollution and GHG emissions, and will lead to reduced urban congestion, support economic growth and enable greater access to employment and other opportunities and services. The federal government committed $28.7 billion over the next decade to support provinces, territories and municipalities in bolstering the capacity, quality, safety and accessibility of public transit infrastructure.

Well-functioning trade corridors are key to enabling Canadians to compete in global markets and trade more efficiently, in turn supporting economic growth and increased opportunities for communities. The $2-billion National Trade Corridors fund will build stronger, more resilient and efficient trade and transportation corridors. It will:  
\0xEF Support the fluidity of Canadian trade to improve supply chain performance; 
\0xEF Increase the resilience of the transportation system to the changing climate; 
\0xEF Ensure adoption and adaptation to new technologies and future innovation; and
\0xEF Improve safety and foster economic and social development in Canadais North.  
Championing innovation
Launched in the fall of 2017, the Smart Cities Challenge seeks to encourage all communities to become dynamic, forward thinking and innovative through the adoption of smart cities approaches. Delivering up to a total of $225 million in prizes directly to communities over 10-years, the Smart Cities Challenge represents a change in the way the Government of Canada provides funding to its communities. 
The Challenge asked communities across Canada to consult with their residents to determine how data and connected technologies could be levered to solve persistent social, economic, environmental or cultural problems and achieve meaningful and measurable positive outcomes. Municipalities, local governments and Indigenous communities from across Canada proposed innovative ideas as diverse as the communities themselves; for example, targeted solutions in such areas as food security, energy and waste management and social services for seniors and youth, as well as tools to attract talent and spur entrepreneurship, improve transportation systems and emergency services and further the goals of reconciliation. 
The Challenge is designed to promote economic growth and support the transition to a clean growth economy by increasing innovation capacity in communities, enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of municipal services and encouraging the creation of productive partnerships across sectors.
Healthy environments for Canadian communities 
Climate change is affecting communities across Canada. The Government of Canadais $180 billion, 12-year infrastructure plan addresses persistent challenges to air, water and soil quality to make Canadian communities, including Indigenous communities, more resilient to climate change, natural disasters and extreme weather events. Investments in environmental quality help reduce our impact on the environment and prepare communities to face the effects of climate change, resulting in increased capacity to treat and manage water and wastewater and reduce or remediate soil and air pollutants. 
New federal investments to infrastructure will strengthen the resilience of communities across the country in the face of climate change. Between 2005 and 2015, Canada experienced disaster-related fatalities and an average annual loss of $1.9 billion. The National

Disaster Mitigation Program provides funding to provinces and territories to help mitigate against flood loss. The $2 billion Disaster Mitigation and Adaptation Fund will mitigate the effects of hazards and natural disasters and make Canadian communities more resilient to the effects of a changing climate. This merit-based program will invest in large-scale adaptation, resilience and disaster-mitigation infrastructure projects. Federal funds are also available to provinces and territories for adaptation, resilience and disastermitigation infrastructure. 
The Government of Canada administers Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements (DFAA) to assist provinces and territories with response and excessive recovery costs. More specifically, in the event that a community is impacted by extreme weather and natural disasters, the DFAA program provides funding to support response and recovery efforts, as well as funding for rebuilding infrastructure that is more resilient to future climate and disaster risks.
Following a natural disaster, provinces and territories are responsible for the design and delivery of financial assistance to those who are affected, including individuals, small businesses and local governments. Overall, the DFAA are intended to support the costs associated with the necessities of life and essential community services disrupted by natural disasters.

These efforts enable and advance the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change (PCF) to generate sustainable economic growth and build resilience in our communities. The PCF highlights human health as one of five key areas of climate change adaptation and includes actions to protect and improve human health and well-being. Canada is committed to prevent illness resulting from extreme heat events and to reduce the risks associated with climatedriven infectious diseases, such as Lyme disease.
with the rest of the world.
Preserving Canadais historical and natural heritage
Canadais historical, cultural and natural heritage plays a vital role in the civic and economic lives of all Canadians. Arts, culture and heritage activities annually contribute $53.8 billion and more than 650,000 jobs to Canadais economy. Canadian contributions to the worldis cultural heritage are many, not the least our cultural artifacts and their world-class museum hosts. 
The 1977 Cultural Property Export and Import Act encourages and ensures the preservation in Canada of significant examples of our artistic, historic and scientific heritage. In 
2016-2017, more than 1,200 objects and collections identified for their outstanding significance and national importance were acquired by Canadian collections through the Actis grant and tax incentive provisions. These national treasures will remain in Canada and be accessible to the public in close to 100 cultural institutions across the country. 

City of Montr\0xC8al 
In June 2016, the Agglomeration Council of Montr\0xC8al adopted Sustainable Montr\0xC8al 2016-2020: an ambitious plan that relies on the mobilization and commitment of Montr\0xC8al organizations working with the municipal administration to achieve 20 actions that contribute to progress on the SDGs. Actions and achievements toward the Plan are highlighted in the Sustainable Montr\0xC8al Report, published in June 2018. In its Economic Development Strategy, as in its Sustainable Montr\0xC8al Plan, Montreal is committed to accelerating its economic development in a sustainable, inclusive and innovative manner.
In February 2017, the Government of Canada made a contribution to UNESCOis Heritage Emergency Fund, reaffirming Canadais commitment to the protection of cultural heritage and pluralism in armed conflict and other emergencies, and to the leadership role played by UNESCO in responding to such emergencies wherever they occur.
Tourism is an important economic driver in urban, rural and remote areas. Parks Canada is present in more than 400 Canadian communities and collaborates with partners and stakeholders to promote and preserve Canadais national parks and historic sites. Ontariois Rouge National Urban Park, for example, comprises natural, cultural and agricultural landscapes that are home to over 1,700 species of plants and animals. As well, some of the last operational farms in Canadais largest urban area, the Greater Toronto Area, rare Carolinian forest ecosystems and human history dating back 10,000 years, including some of Canadais oldest known Indigenous sites, can be found in the park. Amendments made in 2017 to the Rouge National Urban Park Act ensure ecological integrity in the management of the park, while also providing long-term certainty for the parkis farmers. 
Under the Federal Sustainable 
Development Strategy, Connecting 
Canadians with Nature, our target by 2020 is to maintain or increase the number of Canadians that experience Canadais rich, natural heritage\0xF3 e.g. by visiting parks and green spaces\0xF3and increase participation in biodiversity conservation activities relative to the 2010 baseline.  
Canada and the world
The Government of Canada played an active role in the collaboration and discussion that led to the adoption of the New Urban Agenda at the UNis Habitat III Summit in Ecuador. Governments around the world, including Canada, strengthened their commitment to make a meaningful contribution to the sustainable development of towns, cities and human settlements for the next 20 years. Furthermore, through our 
Feminist International Assistance Policy, Canada is committed to pursuing inclusive and sustainable growth, and ensuring actions that contribute to building local capacity. 
The Federation of Canadian Municipalities, through partnerships with and funding from the Government of Canada, delivers more than $25 million annually in nearly 30 countries, working in collaboration with municipal governments and agencies across the globe, with 
an emphasis on strengthening local governance and democracy, fostering economic development and promoting gender equality and environmental sustainability. FCM launched, for example, a $20.7-million, 5-year initiative to mobilize municipal leaders and staff to provide peer-to-peer technical assistance to elected officials and municipal staff in Jordan, where some 1.4 million Syrian refugees seek housing. The program seeks to strengthen leadership and administrative capacity, enhance solid waste management and share knowledge, good practices and lessons learned to benefit municipalities. 
The Government of Canada also played an active role in the negotiation of the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, which included a new blueprint for refugee responses, the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework. All UN member states adopted this declaration, which outlined wideranging commitments to better address large movements of refugees and migrants. At the heart of this framework is a focus on including refugees much more actively in bettersupported host country systems and communities. 
Canadais IDRC supports research on urbanization and its consequences through:
\0xEF The Safe and Inclusive Cities program, an $11.2-million joint global initiative researching the drivers of and solutions to urban violence and exclusion; 
\0xEF Adaptation strategies to counter climate change impacts; and 
\0xEF Supporting research that makes the priority needs of women more visible for urban planners. Research findings from the Global South can help inform Canadian policies on socio-economic inclusion of vulnerable and marginalized groups.
Empowering women and girls, a key development priority for the Government of Canada, is particularly relevant in urban contexts, where poverty and gender inequalities intersect to make womenis needs invisible to urban planners. IDRCis Maternal and Child Health program supported research that identifies effective strategies to engage poor urban women in the design and implementation of projects to improve primary health care in urban slums in Bangladesh. Mobilizing the engagement of these women empowered them to engage with various stakeholders involved in health service delivery, improved their status within the communities and ensured that policies and programs were responsive to their health-care needs.
Through partnerships with the governments of Canada and the United Kingdom, IDRC invested close to $200 million in the last decade to roughly 160 research projects that strengthen evidence on climate resilience in some of the mostvulnerable regions of Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean. This investment is one of the largest global commitments to adaptation research in the developing world. 
 
Next steps
\0xEF Continue the implementation of the Government of Canadais $180 billion, 12-year Investing in 
Canada Plan, including roll out the 
National Housing Strategy; and 
\0xEF The Government of Canada will continue to sign Integrated Bilateral Agreements with Provinces and Territories to fund public transit, green and social infrastructure, as well as invest in northern and rural communities.

Goal-by-goal actions
SDG 12: Ensure sustainable consumption and production 

patterns
Since mid-2016, household consumption has been the main driver of economic growth in Canada, increasing at an average annualized pace of 3.9% per quarter. To promote responsible consumption and production, economic growth must align with our existing resource volatility and shifting consumer preferences for safer, renewable and more sustainable natural resources and products. Education is one of the most powerful tools for providing individuals with the appropriate skills and competencies to become sustainable consumers.
Rising to the challenge
Clean technology and energy efficiency
Increasing the development and use of clean technology in the natural resource sector is integral to Canadais ability to make a clean, lower-carbon transition over the near and long term.
In 2017, the Government of Canada announced the $155-million Clean Growth Program to fund clean tech projects in the areas of energy, mining and forestry. This program focuses on reducing greenhouse gas and air emissions from natural resource operations; minimizing landscape disturbances and improving waste management in natural resource operations and in the production and use of advanced materials and 

bioproducts in natural resource operations; efficient energy use and productivity in natural resource operations; and reducing water use and impacts on aquatic ecosystems from natural resource operations. 
Additional federal commitments to clean technology made in 2016 and 2017 include:  
\0xEF Nearly $1.4 billion in new financing to help Canadais clean tech firms grow and expand; 
\0xEF $400 million for Sustainable 
Development Technology Canada to develop and demonstrate new clean technologies; 
\0xEF $200 million to support research, development, demonstration and the adoption of clean technology in Canadais natural resources sectors; 
\0xEF $822 million for next-generation clean energy infrastructure projects; and 
\0xEF $14.5 million for a Clean Technology Data Strategy.  
More recently, the Clean Growth Hub, officially launched in January 2018, is a whole-of-government focal point for clean technology focused on supporting companies and projects, coordinating programs and tracking results. To date, the Hub has provided advisory services to more than 200 clean tech clients.
The Government of Canada also committed to several measures to grow clean technology in Canada as part of the Innovation and Skills Plan and the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change. Canada will make major investments in building early-stage innovation, accelerating commercialization and growth, fostering greater adoption of clean technologies, increasing exports of clean technologies and processes, and strengthening collaboration and metrics for success. 
A key driver of the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and 
Climate Change is Canadais Buildings Strategy, which highlights Canadais support in developing building codes for effective action on climate change adaptation and resilience. Updated building codes will make new buildings net-zero ready, that is, buildings can potentially produce as much energy as they consume through using renewable energy sources such as solar panels.
Management of natural resources 
Canada is one of the top manufacturers of forest products in the world. In 2016, the forest industry contributed to $23.1 billion to Canadais GDP. 
Canadais sustainable forest management regime ensures that our forests remain healthy and continue to provide a steady stream of benefits for Canadians. With strong laws, oversight and management, timber harvesting in Canada is sustainable. For example, to ensure forest sustainability over the long term, provincial and territorial governments regulate harvest levels through forest management plans. This is done by specifying an allowable annual cut, which is the annual level of harvest allowed on a specific area of Crown land over a set number of years (5 to 10 years, in most cases). Additionally, all Crown lands that are harvested for commercial timber must be regenerated naturally, by planting, seeding, or planting and seeding. 
Furthermore, 48% of forests in Canada are certified, which provides third-party assurance that the forest is managed under recognized standards of sustainable forest management.
The Government of Canada, in collaboration with provincial and territorial governments and Indigenous partners, is moving into the implementation phase of the Forest Bio-economy Framework for Canada to facilitate opportunities for renewable bio-economy, biomaterials and other bio-products that limit or reduce carbon output while preserving biodiversity.

SDG 12: Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns SDG 12: Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns


Canada has a long and successful history and a strong, well-earned reputation as a leading mining nation. Canada produces 60 minerals and metals that constitute key raw materials for the goods we rely on in our daily lives, from utensils to smartphones to solar cells. In 2017, total Canadian mineral production reached a value of $43.9 billion, an increase of 11.3% from the 2016 total of $39.4 billion.
To ensure Canada remains a world leader in sustainable mineral development and lay the foundation for lasting success at home and abroad, the Government of Canada is leading the creation of a shared vision with provincial and territorial governments, Indigenous peoples, industry and other partners through the Canadian Minerals and Metals Plan. 
Canadais Green Mining Initiative invests in collaborative research and development that promotes technologies to increase productivity and energy efficiency, and reduce emissions, waste and water use. Green procurement 
Public procurement represents a significant cost and is one way in which the Government can take leadership in promoting a green and low-carbon economy. Under the Greening Government Strategy, the Government of Canada has committed to aid the transition to a low-carbon economy through green procurement and the adoption of clean technologies and green products and services by:  
\0xEF Integrating sustainability and life-cycle assessment principles in procurement policies and practices, including the Governmentis supply chain;
\0xEF Working with major suppliers to encourage the disclosure of their GHG emissions and environmental performance information;
\0xEF Supporting departments in adopting clean technology and clean tech demonstration projects; and 
\0xEF Increasing training for and support on green procurement to public service employees.
Chemical and hazardous waste management
Each year, millions of tonnes of waste are generated in Canada as by-products of industrial activity. This waste contains chemicals such as acids, phenols, arsenic, lead and mercury and is considered hazardous to human health and/or the environment if improperly handled.
A number of international and domestic factors are driving changes in the way Canada handles its hazardous waste and recyclables. One factor is that Canada has ratified the UNis Basel Convention, which requires the environmentally sound management of hazardous wastes and recyclables and reductions in exports for final disposal. Canada has also implemented the OECD Council Decision on the control of transboundary movements of waste destined for recycling, and has signed a separate bilateral agreement with the United States to control the transboundary movement of hazardous waste and recyclables, including municipal solid waste.
The Canadian Environmental Protection Act enhances the federal governmentis authority to enact regulations that govern the export and import of hazardous wastes and hazardous recyclable materials, including transits through Canada and transits through other countries for shipments to and from Canada.
In 2006, Canada committed to assess 4,300 priority existing substances by 2020 under the Chemicals Management Plan. These priority substances were identified during a process of categorization and prioritization of 23,000 substances registered as being in commercial use in Canada. 
Canada is close to reaching its 2020 goal. As of March 31, 2018, 80% of the 4,300 priority existing substances had been assessed and addressed as necessary. Furthermore, prior to the introduction of substances new to Canada, the Government assesses and, when necessary, manages any potential risk to Canadians and their environment.
Cities in action 

Initiatives are emerging across 
Canada to tackle the problem of waste generation, including:
\0xEF The City of Vancouveris 2020 goal to reduce solid waste going to landfill by 50% from 2008, with textile waste being one area of focus; 
\0xEF The Strategy for a Waste-Free Ontario: Building the Circular Economy, which commits to reducing emissions from waste and moving Ontario toward a circular economy; and
\0xEF The City of Montr\0xC8alis 2016 by law, which prohibits the distribution of certain types of shopping bags in retail stores.

Zero waste 
Making the transition to a zero-waste economy will require a large shift in how we think about food, goods and our everyday practices. 
In response to the traditional linear economy where companies \0xECtake, make, dispose, a circular economy explores ways to reduce waste by extending the lifecycle of products and materials. Applicable to all sectors, a circular economy goes beyond the notions of reuse, recycle and reduce to maximize value by addressing how products are designed, produced, distributed, used and reintegrated into the market. 
In the agricultural and food sector, the Government of Canada recognizes that the way our food is produced, processed, distributed and consumed\0xF3including the losses and waste of food\0xF3can have environmental implications, including GHG emissions, soil degradation, water quality and availability, and wildlife loss. 
In Canada, the majority of food waste comes from consumers. Work is being done to ensure that people everywhere have the relevant information and awareness for sustainable development and lifestyles in harmony with nature. For example, Metro Vancouveris Love Food Hate Waste Program offers easy tips and ideas to reduce food waste at home. In consultation with Canadians, the Government of Canada is also developing A Food Policy for Canada, which will establish education tools and act to reduce industry food loss and consumer food waste.

Canada is also a world leader in extended producer responsibility and product stewardship programs. These programs help shift the financial burden of disposing plastic waste from taxpayers to plastics producers. There are more than 160 regulated and voluntary programs of this sort in Canada. They cover more than 20 product categories such as packaging, printed paper, beverage containers and electronics in 12 provinces and territories.
Engagement
A shift in consumer preferences and the need to remain competitive and cut costs are pushing governments and industry to improve access to transparent product information and deliver innovate solutions to an ever-changing economy. As such, it remains essential that the Government remain engaged with provincial and territorial governments, business, industry and civil society to address both the supply and demand drivers of sustainable consumption and production. 
Provision Coalition 
The Provision Coalition is committed to working with its members to make food and beverage manufacturers more sustainable, more competitive and more successful. One of the largest challenges when it comes to reducing food loss and waste comes from the lack of awareness. Most companies do not quantify the true costs of food loss and waste, so the Provision Coalition is committed to educating companies on how to quantify the economic, environmental and social impact of food waste. They have created an online food waste reduction toolkit and dashboard that allows companies to track energy, greenhouse gas, water consumption and waste reduction, in addition to other business priorities.

SDG 12: Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns SDG 12: Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns


Through its Small and Medium Enterprise Sustainability Roadmap, the Government of Canada helps businesses to manage their social and environmental impacts, develop products and services that meet the needs of a circular economy, and show leadership in sustainable development. 
The Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME), through the Canada-wide Action Plan for Extended Producer Responsibility, also supports the move toward greater producer responsibility, including work toward transforming \0xECproduct stewardship initiatives into full extended producer responsibility programs, to manage products at their end-of-life. 
In response to a growing market for safer, renewable and more sustainable natural resources, Canadais Biobased Specialty Chemicals program works with Canadian companies to develop technologies and services that produce high-value specialty chemicals from biomass as an alternative to traditional fossil fuel feedstocks.
Through the Office of Consumer Affairs, the Government of Canada supports consumer groups and NGOs to ensure they provide effective input into policy development through its Contributions Program for NonProfit Consumer and Voluntary 
Organizations, which has funded over 40 sustainable consumption- and production-related research projects since 2002. 
The Government of Canada also works with the Canadian Standards Association to publish guidelines for the business community to ensure that green marketing is not misleading, while providing consumers with greater assurance about the accuracy of environmental claims.
To further promote education and awareness to ensure that consumers have the information and tools needed to make sustainable decisions, the Government of Canada maintains consumerhandbook.ca, an online portal that provides easy access to accurate, relevant and reliable consumer information. 
Other federal government-led tools and programs to improve consumer knowledge and conscious purchasing habits include ENERGY STAR, the EnerGuide label and the Canadian EcoLogo Program. Canada and the world 
Canada works with the G7, G20, OECD and other international stakeholders on issues related to resource efficiency and the circular economy. Canada has made a number of G7 commitments in this area, including the 2015 G7 Action Plan to Combat Marine Litter, which established the G7 Alliance on Resource Efficiency, the 2016 Toyama Framework on Material Cycles and the 2017 Bologna Roadmap on resource efficiency. 
Through its 2018 G7 presidency, Canada is promoting joint efforts under the broader theme of \0xECWorking Together on Climate 
Change, Ocean and Energy. Under 
Canadais leadership, five of the G7 countries recently agreed to an Oceans Plastics Charter that commits to taking a resource-efficient lifecycle management approach to plastics stewardship on land and at sea through sustainable design and production, collection and management, sustainable lifestyle and education, research and innovation, and action on the ground. 
Through such initiatives, Canada will continue to work with its international partners to create a more resourceefficient economy that protects both its natural resources and citizens.  
Next steps
Continue to take action toward a resource-efficient lifecycle management approach to plastics in the economy by:
\0xEF Working with industry toward 100% reusable, recyclable, or, where viable alternatives do not exist, recoverable, plastics by 2030;
\0xEF Promoting the leadership role of women and youth as promoters of sustainable consumption and production practices; and
\0xEF Increasing domestic capacity to manage plastics as a resource, prevent their leakage into the marine environment from all sources, and enable their collection, reuse, recycling, recovery and/or environmentally sound disposal.

Goal-by-goal actions
SDG 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its 

impacts  
Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges facing humanity today. The science is conclusive. It tells us that swift action is needed to reduce greenhouse gases, enhance climate resilience and protect our natural environment.
The Government of Canada is committed to be a leader in advancing action on climate change and clean growth, both at home and abroad, by investing in climate-smart policies and initiatives that are grounded in rigorous science and evidence-based decision making.
Rising to the challenge
In addition to being among the first countries to sign and ratify the Paris Agreement, Canada is following through on its Paris commitments by implementing a national plan to reduce its GHG emissions by 30% below 2005 levels by 2030 and build resilience to the impacts of climate change. 
A landmark achievement, the Pan-
Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change is the first climate change plan in Canadais history to include collective and individual commitments by federal, provincial and territorial governments, and to have been developed through engagement with national representatives of First Nations, Inuit and M\0xC8tis, the general public, NGOs and businesses. 
Government leadership is critical to achieving Canadais goals for environmental and sustainable development. Introduced in 2017, the Greening Government Strategy commits to increasing the resilience of federal assets, services and operations, and sets an ambitious target to reduce GHG emissions from federal operations by 80% by 2050, relative to 2005 levels. 
In 2017, Canada also published its 
measures to reduce carbon pollution, build resilience to the impacts of climate change, foster clean tech solutions and create good jobs that contribute to a strong economy. This includes putting a price on carbon.
To support implementation of the Pan-Canadian Framework, the Government of Canada has announced historic investments including the Low Carbon Economy Fund and the Investing in Canada plan, which support projects aimed at reducing GHG emissions and generating clean growth.
transit including smart grids, energyefficient buildings and electric vehicle infrastructure, the federal government aims to help mainstream innovative clean technologies. 
Infrastructure investments will also be leveraged to bolster climate resiliency. 
Canadais Disaster Mitigation and Adaptation Fund, for example, will support large-scale projects, including natural infrastructure projects, enabling communities to better manage the risk associated with current and future natural hazards, such as floods, wildfires and droughts. 
Strategy on Short-Lived Climate Pollutants, including black carbon and methane, as part of a holistic approach for meeting climate and air quality objectives. This strategy complements the Pan-Canadian Framework.
Furthermore, Canadais Federal Sustainable Development Strategy outlines 13 ambitious environmental goals, including effective action on climate change, and sets out the Government of Canadais environmental sustainable development priorities, targets and concrete actions to achieve them. 
Canadais most recent GHG emissions projections (December 2017) demonstrate progress toward our 2030 emissions reduction target. 
Town of Plessisville 
The Town of Plessisville, Quebec, is one of the leading cities in terms of sustainable development in Quebec. One of the five areas of development of Plessisvilleis strategic plan (2015-2025) is the promotion and development of a healthy, preserved and sustainable environment. As such, the municipality has implemented several approaches focused on sustainable development. Plessisville is the first municipality in Quebec to complete the five stages of the Partners in Climate Protection program. It has taken the necessary measures to reduce GHG emissions and improve energy efficiency, making Plessisville a leader in the local fight against climate change.
Taking into account policies and measures, both implemented and announced, Canadais emissions in 2030 are expected to be 583 MT, i.e. 232 MT below the previous projection. This decline is equivalent to approximately one third of Canadais 2015 emissions. The decline is widespread across all economic sectors, reflecting the breadth and depth of the Pan-Canadian Framework. 
Further progress is expected at the national level as current estimates do not include the full reductions from investments in public transit, clean technology and innovation. Nor do these projections account for new policies that may be implemented by governments\0xF3municipal, 
provincial/territorial or federal\0xF3 between now and 2030. Potential increases in stored carbon (i.e. carbon sequestration) in forests, soils and wetlands will also contribute to reductions. 
When the policies and programs within the Pan-Canadian Framework are fully implemented, the Framework will not only allow Canada to meet 
its 2030 target in full, but it will also position Canada to set and achieve deeper reductions beyond 2030. The federal government and the provinces and territories have committed through the Pan-Canadian Framework 
to report on progress and take stock of results in order to be more ambitious over time. 
In November 2016, Canada became 
one of the first six countries to submit its Mid-Century Long-term LowGHG Development Strategy (MCS), thereby articulating its long-term, deep de-carbonization considerations under the Paris Agreement. Canadais MCS outlines various pathways to illustrate how Canada could transition

to a lower-carbon economy by 2050, i.e. to achieve an 80% reduction in GHG emissions from 2005 levels, consistent with the Paris Agreement. 
Canada has also been taking proactive action to better understand and manage the impacts associated with the changing climate, including in Canadais North. In 2016 and 2017, the Government made investments to support the implementation of the adaptation and climate resilience pillar of the Pan-Canadian Framework. This included programming for information and capacity building, climate-resilient infrastructure, human health and well-being, vulnerable regions, and climate-related hazards and disaster risks. Canada also invested in initiatives to support Indigenous peoples to monitor climate change in their communities and to connect Indigenous knowledge systems and science to build a better understanding of impacts to inform adaptation actions.
These investments build off a strong foundation of engagement and action on adaptation. For example, Canadais Climate Change Adaptation Platform was established in 2012 and brings together governments, industry and professional organizations to collaborate on climate change adaptation priorities, including through specific working groups on key economic sectors, biodiversity adaptation, science assessments and infrastructure and buildings.  

SDG 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts 	97

Foundation for Environmental Stewardship 
The Foundation for Environmental Stewardship (FES) aims to cultivate a growing spirit of environmentalism by educating children and youth on the climate crisis, thus empowering them to take action on solving climate change in their local communities. 
One of their main initiatives is the 3% project, which mobilizes a million Canadian youth\0xF33% of Canadais population\0xF3through 
5 national tours to 600 schools. FES provides youth-friendly and holistic education on climate change and works in partnership with academic institutions to create a more inclusive, equitable, prosperous and sustainable future. FES inspired two students in Ontariois York Region District to develop a youth-led SDGs training session for over 200 students across 22 schools in the region. That training has catalyzed the creation of Canadais first high school club for the SDGs. 
Engagement
Provinces and territories, municipalities, Indigenous peoples, businesses, youth and civil society across Canada are at the forefront of action on climate change. 
Provincial and territorial governments have adopted ambitious climate policies tailored to their circumstances, and municipalities of all sizes are taking measures to build healthy, sustainable cities. Both regional and local governments have the ability to stimulate the economy while protecting the environment through initiatives that invest in public transportation, promote green infrastructure and clean energy and develop climate responses that protect the health and safety of their citizens. 
Indigenous peoples of Canada are leaders in taking action on climate change, holders of traditional knowledge and stewards of the environment.
Underlying the Pan-Canadian 
Framework is the Government of Canadais commitment to strengthen collaboration with Indigenous peoples, based on recognition of rights, respect, cooperation and partnership. The Government of Canada is committed to ensuring that Indigenous peoples are real partners in Canadais transition to a lower-carbon economy and in building resilience. 
Canadian cities

The Federation of Canadian 
Municipalities (FCM) represents 90% of Canadais population. In collaboration 
with members and through its programs, FCM develops and implements a range of green practices and technologies to help Canada fight climate change. FCM has been the national voice of municipal government since 1901. Members include Canadais largest cities, small urban and rural communities, and 20 provincial and territorial municipal associations.  
www.fcm.ca
That is why the Government has formed partnership tables with First Nations, Inuit and M\0xC8tis to support the successful implementation of the PanCanadian Framework and to advance broader clean growth and climate change priorities. 
Internationally, Canada is advocating for the enhanced participation of Indigenous peoples in multilateral climate forums, including at the UN Framework Convention on 
Climate Change as part of the Local 
Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform, and in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. 
Canadais youth and NGOs play a vital role in strengthening and informing government efforts on climate change. Through vigorous advocacy and open dialogue, they give voice to a wide variety of groups and hold governments accountable to their promises.  

SDG 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts 

Canada plays a leadership role in Mission Innovation, a global initiative to accelerate clean energy solutions, by participating in all seven innovation challenges and co-leading both the Sustainable Biofuels Innovation Challenge and the Clean Energy Materials Innovation Challenge.
Canada and the world
Canada continues to demonstrate its strong commitment to clean growth and climate change in a number of multilateral forums that work to reduce harmful emissions, enhance climate resilience and take advantage of the economic and social opportunities offered by the global shift to cleaner growth.
Canada, in partnership with China and the European Union, launched the Ministerial Meeting on Climate Action as a forum for ministers from major economies and other key players to discuss the ambitious implementation of climate commitments.
In December 2017, Canada joined Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico and two U.S. states to establish the Declaration on Carbon Markets in the Americas, to enhance promotion and collaboration on carbon pricing.
As one of the first countries to ratify the Montr\0xC8al Protocol and a founding member of the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, Canada has been a strong voice for the phase down of hydrofluorocarbons and other shortlived climate pollutants (SLCPs). This contributes to addressing nearterm climate change effects and substantially reducing the health impacts of SLCPs emissions. In collaboration with this coalition and the Global Methane Initiative, Canada hosted the 2018 Global Methane Forum. 
Canada also committed to the Arctic Councilis first aspirational, collective goal to cut black carbon by 25% to 33% by 2025. In November 2017, Canada ratified the Gothenburg 
Protocol and its 2012 amendments. The Protocol was the first legally binding instrument to include a focus on SLCPs. As a member of the Arctic Council, Canada also supported the development of an Arctic Resilience Action Framework in 2017, which provides a set of common priorities and targets that promote improved collaboration and effectiveness among the Arctic Council and Arctic Council partners to enhance Arctic resilience.
Canada and the United Kingdom co-founded the Powering Past Coal Alliance to help accelerate clean growth and climate protection through the rapid phase-out of traditional coal-fired electricity. The Alliance now counts 64 partners.
As a member of the multi-stakeholder 2050 Pathways Platform, Canada shares lessons learned from the development of its MCS and continues to encourage and support other countries, subnational governments and businesses as they develop long-term, net zero-GHG, climate-resilient and sustainable development strategies.
Canada is also actively engaged at the International Maritime Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to reduce emissions from the international marine and aviation sectors, and in particular has volunteered to participate in the offsetting of emissions through ICAOis Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation from the outset. 
Canada remains committed to supporting the poorest and mostvulnerable populations affected by climate change. Canada is delivering on its pledge of $2.65 billion in climate finance by 2020-2021 to help developing countries transition to a lower-carbon, climate-resilient economy. As part of its $2.65 billion climate finance commitment, Canada will provide $1.8 billion to help mobilize private-sector funding for climate action and build on Canadais strong experience with blended climate finance. Canadian climate finance is being delivered through a range of bilateral and multilateral partners. To date, Canada has announced:
\0xEF $300 million to the Green Climate Fund, the primary global fund aimed at addressing climate challenges in developing countries;
\0xEF $30 million to the Least Developed 
Countries Fund, administered by the Global Environment Facility, which addresses urgent adaptation needs among the poorest and mostvulnerable countries;
\0xEF $50 million to the G7 Initiative on Climate Risk Insurance to increase climate resilience in developing countries, including $40 million to the Africa Risk Capacity for climate risk insurance;
\0xEF $200 million to establish a second phase of the Canadian Climate Fund for the Private Sector in 
Asia, administered by the Asian 
Development Bank;
99

\0xEF $150 to the G7 African Renewable Energy Initiative to address both climate change mitigation and access to energy by leveraging private sector investment;
\0xEF $17.2 million to Cowater International to support sustainable energy and economic growth in the particularly vulnerable region of Boucle du Mouhoun, Burkina Faso.
Through the Feminist International Assistance Policy, Canada promotes environment and climate action by supporting initiatives in developing countries to mitigate and adapt to climate change, advance womenis leadership and decision making and create economic opportunities for women in clean energy. Around the world, women with less access to resources and greater responsibility for family and community welfare are disproportionately feeling the effects of climate change.
As 2018 G7 president, Canada put forward a progressive agenda to promote clean energy, womenis empowerment and economic growth that works for everyone. In preparation for the Environment Ministerial Meeting, Canada convened a women climate leadersi summit titled Women Kicking it on Climate. The summit convened influential women who lead global efforts on climate change to look at how climate action can be gender responsive and contribute to gender equity.   
Next steps
\0xEF Canada will continue to implement its Paris Agreement commitments by reducing GHG emissions, pricing carbon pollution across Canada in 2018 and implementing regulations for coal-fired and natural gas electricity, heavy-duty vehicles and the oil and gas sector.
\0xEF The Government of Canada will launch the Canadian Centre for Climate Services to deliver trusted and useful climate information and tools to support climate adaptation, as well as consider the advice of the external Expert Panel on Climate Change Adaptation and Resilience Results on measuring progress on adaptation and climate resilience.  
\0xEF Alongside provinces and territories and Indigenous peoples, Canada will pursue a new Arctic Policy Framework grounded in scientific and Indigenous knowledge to support the protection of Arctic biodiversity, community wellbeing and a sustainable and diversified economy.
\0xEF Continue to deliver on our climate finance commitments, including by building on innovative strategies, such as blended climate finance.
\0xEF Support the effective implementation of the Paris Agreement, including the completion of the Paris Work Programme (the \0xECrulebook) at COP 24 in December 2018.
\0xEF Continue to support the participation of women in international climate change negotiations, including through the Gender Action Plan of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.

Goal-by-goal actions
SDG 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development

Canada is uniquely blessed with an abundance of freshwater and marine and coastal areas that are ecologically diverse and economically significant. Rising sea levels, ocean acidification and thinning sea ice, however, are affecting vulnerable regions and coastal communities, including the Arctic and its Indigenous peoples. The Government of Canada has placed a high priority on protecting its oceans.
Healthy and resilient oceans help to mitigate the effects of climate change, provide food security to millions of people around the world and drive economic activity through marine trade and transport.
Although Canada has made progress in protecting the health and resilience of its oceans, some challenges remain, including to conserve and sustainably use the oceans and marine resources for sustainable development. 
SDG 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development
It is important for Canada to continue working domestically, as well as with its international partners, to bolster the limited scientific information on the oceans that currently exists. Other challenges facing Canada include improving the inclusion of traditional Indigenous knowledge in planning and assessments, ensuring the adequate distribution of benefits and costs resulting from marine resource use and management, and fostering meaningful participation of potentially affected stakeholders and partners.  coastline\0xF3it borders the Pacific, Atlantic and Arctic oceans\0xF3and one of the largest ocean bodies of any country in the world. These waters are central to Canadais heritage, culture and economy. 
Canadians rely on their coasts and waterways to earn a living, to import goods and to export Canadian products. Canadais \0xECblue economy accounts for approximately $36 billion annually in GDP and 350,000 jobs. 
In November 2016, Canada launched the $1.5-billion Oceans Protection Plan, the largest investment ever made to protect Canadais coasts and waterways.
The Plan aims to enhance our marine safety system, further protect marine ecosystems and habitats, create stronger Indigenous partnerships and engage coastal communities, provinces, territories, industry and other stakeholders and invest in oil spill clean-up research.
Through the Oceans Protection Plan, Canada works with partners and engages Indigenous and coastal communities to make navigation safer by supporting enhanced sharing of marine traffic information with local communities in real-time, providing modern hydrography and charting in key areas of high-traffic waterways, and setting tougher requirements on industry to provide quicker action for any spill from a ship. 
The Oceans Protection Plan also strengthens the capacity of the Canadian Coast Guard to better coordinate federal emergency response. In addition, it provides funding for on-the-ground marine safety equipment and infrastructure for northern coastal communities to improve environmental protection and achieve faster, safer and moreefficient Arctic operations.
Protecting and restoring marine ecosystems and mammals is another key element of Canadais Oceans Protection Plan. This includes developing vigilant mitigation measures, better monitoring of cleanups in the event of a spill and creating a monitoring program to better understand the cumulative effects of shipping on coastal ecosystems. 

Canada is advancing research on underwater noise, for example, and implementing vessel slowdowns in key areas and habitats to protect endangered species from vessel strikes and underwater noise.
While the majority of vessel owners properly dispose of their property, the small number of abandoned and wrecked vessels can pose significant threats to safe navigation, the marine environment, public health and local economies. Therefore, a comprehensive strategy that focuses on prevention and removal, including new legislation and polluter-pay approaches for future vessel clean-up, was announced and is currently being implemented.
Canada has also taken steps to help address the health of our oceans and aquatic systems through new regulations, under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, that prohibit the manufacture, import and sale of toiletries containing plastic microbeads; the regulations came into force in January 2018. Micro-plastics have been observed in industrialized coastal waters, in the open ocean and in remote environments such as the Arctic. 
Canada is taking a leadership role on advancing action on ocean plastics, most notably through its G7 presidency and the adoption of the Ocean Plastics Charter by five of the G7 countries, which includes ambitious targets to move toward a more resource efficient and sustainable approach to the management of plastics to prevent their leakage into the marine environment. 
Under Canadais G7 presidency, we are also calling for improved scientific research to better understand ocean environments and to conserve vulnerable marine areas and species, emphasizing that the G7 must seize innovative approaches to strengthen marine and coastal recovery and resilience, and to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.
Canada is committed and on track to meeting the international target of protecting 10% of our marine and coastal areas by 2020, under the Convention on Biological Diversityis Aichi Biodiversity Targets.
Canada has now surpassed its own domestic marine conservation target\0xF3to protect 5% of its marine and coastal areas by the end of 2017\0xF3largely by establishing marine protected areas (MPAs) and identifying other effective areabased conservation measures across Canadais marine bioregions. Canada is also exploring ways to protect the \0xECLast Ice Area in the Arctic, in collaboration with Indigenous and northern partners.
Canada sees MPAs as essential for protecting coastal communities and supporting their local economies. Together with provinces, territories, Indigenous peoples, coastal communities and other stakeholders, the identification of these areas is done collaboratively and is grounded in robust scientific research and 
Indigenous traditional knowledge.  
Snapshot of available data
Canada has protected 7.75% of its marine and coastal areas (as of December 2017) by establishing federal, provincial and territorial MPAs and other effective area-based conservation measures.
Canada continues to track the performance of the major fish stocks it manages through the Sustainability Survey for Fisheries. The 2016 survey examined 170 stocks and noted whether they are managed and harvested at levels considered to be sustainable. It also assessed the use of the precautionary approach in managing these fish stocks. The survey data is also used in the Canadian Environmental Sustainability Indicators report, which tracks Canadais performance on key environmental sustainability issues.  
Engagement
Collaboration is the cornerstone of programs and initiatives launched under the Oceans Protection Plan and the Government of Canada values the traditional knowledge and expertise of Canadais Indigenous peoples and coastal communities. The Government is exploring new governance arrangements with Indigenous peoples to partner in marine spatial planning, monitoring and protection activities. 
In exploring ways for communities to become more involved in managing local waterways, the federal government is initiating pilot projects with specific Indigenous communities that provide a user-friendly system to increase access to local maritime information, including vessel traffic. 

SDG 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development SDG 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development

Nature Conservancy of Canada 
The Nature Conservancy of Canada (NCC) is working to protect biodiversity within marine ecosystems across the country. NCCis largest Atlantic Canada conservation area is the Musquash Estuary in New Brunswick, with more than 2,000 hectares of marshes, coastal forests and cobble beaches surrounding this important ecosystem. In Nunavut, NCC is helping establish Canadais largest marine protected area to protect a biodiversityrich area of key importance both ecologically and to the Inuit population of the region.
To strengthen partnerships with Indigenous groups and coastal communities, the Government of Canada, under the Oceans Protection Plan, is making available capacity funding to enable participation of Indigenous groups and local communities in the planning and implementation of the Oceans Protection Plan.
To further build capacity, the federal government and private sector are co-investing in Canadais Ocean Supercluster. Through the Ocean Supercluster, companies will partner with post-secondary institutions and Indigenous groups to accelerate innovation and to drive increased sustainable economic growth from our oceans.  
Canada and the world
As a shared natural resource, the successful management and protection of the worldis oceans and seas requires global cooperation.
Canada has a history of taking a leadership role to ensure fish resources are effectively managed internationally, to promote sustainable fisheries management and healthy global marine ecosystems, and to contribute to a stable trade regime for Canadian fish and seafood products.
Canada was the first government to have an Oceans Act (1997) and among the first to establish marine protected areas.
Canadian leadership was also instrumental in developing international oceans governance, including the UNis Convention on the Law of the Sea, the UN Agreement on Straddling and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, the Food and Agriculture 
Organizationis (FAOis) Agreement on 
Port State Measures and the FAOis 
Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries. Canada also played a large role in other international conventions affecting oceans, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Montr\0xC8al Protocol. 
Canada is an active member of the UN Regular Process for Global Reporting and Assessment of the State of the Marine Environment, including Socioeconomic Aspects (World Ocean Assessment), which aims to improve understanding of the oceans and develop a global mechanism for delivering sciencebased information to decision makers and the public.

SDG indicator 14.5.1  Coverage of protected areas in relation to marine areas

Canada has also been active in raising the issue of underwater vessel noise in the international community, including at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) on the need for additional international action. At the Arctic Council, Canada is sponsoring a state of knowledge report on the issue. In addition, Canada has been collaborating closely with the United States to protect and support the recovery of endangered North Atlantic right whales and southern resident killer whales, whose habitat spans the two countriesi waters.
To fulfill our obligations under international treaties that deal with waste and marine protection, Canada has also signed onto the 
Basel Convention, the International 
Convention for the Prevention of 
Pollution from Ships and the London Convention and Protocol. Canada is also working to comply with other international instruments that we have signed onto, including the G7 Action Plan to Combat Marine Litter and the UN Clean Seas Campaign, which aims to address the rootcause of plastic litter in the marine environment. Canada contributed to the development, and supported the adoption of, IMO Guidelines for the Control and Management of Shipsi Biofouling to Minimize the Transfer of Invasive Aquatic Species, 2011, and will continue to be an active participant in the upcoming review of those guidelines. 
In addition, Canada has played a leadership role in negotiations with other Arctic states and interested nations on a new legally binding treaty, the Agreement to Prevent Unregulated High Seas Fisheries in the Central Arctic Ocean. Upon coming into force, the Agreement will prevent unregulated commercial fishing in an area measuring approximately 2.8 million square kilometres. It will also establish an extensive joint science research and monitoring program that will aim to improve the understanding of the ecosystems within and surrounding it and, in particular, determine whether there are fish stocks that could be harvested on a regulated, sustainable basis. Canada has also been an active participant in the preparatory process to develop a new legally binding treaty under the UN to protect marine biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction and will participate in the formal negotiations beginning in 2018. 
As part of Canadais G7 presidency in 2018, Canada developed the Charlevoix Blueprint for Healthy 
Oceans, Seas and Resilient Coastal Communities. The Blueprint was adopted by G7 leaders in June 2018 and includes commitments related to: increasing the availability and sharing of oceans science and data, supporting strategies to effectively protect and manage vulnerable areas of the oceans, and tackling illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. 
Next steps
\0xEF Canadais federal, provincial and territorial governments, and Indigenous organizations and other stakeholders, are continuing to work together to identify ocean areas that are biologically and significantly important, unique, representative or that may require protection, and to reach our target of protecting at least 10% of Canadais coastal and marine areas by 2020.
\0xEF The Agreement to Prevent Unregulated High Seas Fisheries in the Central Arctic Ocean is expected to be formally signed by participating states in the fall of 
2018, and Canada will serve as the depository for the Agreement. 
\0xEF Canada will seek to build stronger publicnprivate partnerships to develop and deploy innovative platforms and technology to identify vessels and engage in, or support, IUU fishing activities. We will also work to promote global adoption and implementation of the Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter, and Eliminate IUU Fishing, address harmful fish subsidies that contribute to overfishing and IUU fishing, and promote innovation for fishing gear design and recovery to prevent lost and abandoned fishing gear. 
\0xEF In response to a growing ocean economy and increasing pressures on the marine environment, Canada will be initiating marine spatial planning to reconcile and achieve diverse socioeconomic, cultural and conservation objectives in its oceans.
\0xEF Canada will continue to work internationally to promote the conservation and sustainable use of the marine environment and its resources, guided by the use of rigorous science, meaningful consultation and the precautionary approach. For example, Canada is co-hosting the Blue Economy Conference with Kenya in Nairobi from November 26 to 28, 2018. The conference is a demonstration of Canadais commitment to support healthy and productive oceans, building sustainable economies, and resilient, and inclusive communities, especially in developing coastal states.

Goal-by-goal actions
SDG 15: Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification and halt and reverse land degradation, and halt biodiversity loss

Canada is home to significant biodiversity such as the boreal forest and iconic wildlife, including polar bear, grizzly bear, caribou and millions of migratory birds breeding in the Arctic and elsewhere in Canada. Even as scientists discover new species (estimates suggest millions remain unknown), biodiversity is under threat from competing land uses, pollution, population growth and human activities.
Canadais forests, wetlands, peatlands, prairies and tundra all provide essential habitat for wildlife populations and overall biodiversity. Sustainable management of these lands and forests, including through conservation and protected areas, is key to maintaining healthy ecosystems and ensuring their benefits, including filtering air and water and storing carbon dioxide. 

Creating protected areas also safeguards areas that are important to Canadais heritage, including places that hold cultural and spiritual significance to Indigenous peoples, and are important to all Canadians. 
Lands and forests are an important part of Canadais economy. In 2016, the forest industry alone represented approximately 1.2% (or roughly $23 billion) of Canadais nominal 
GDP and directly supported over 200,000 jobs across the country. Canadais national parks and historic sites also generate about $3.3 billion annually, supporting the equivalent of approximately 40,000 full-time jobs.  
Rising to the challenge
Canada was the first industrialized country to ratify the United Nationsi Convention on Biological Diversity 
(CBD), in 1992, and has hosted the CBD secretariat for over 20 years. 
Federal, provincial and territorial governments have worked together for decades to sustain Canadais biodiversity. Since the signing of the CBD, governments have collaborated on many initiatives, beginning with 
the development of the Canadian Biodiversity Strategy in 1995, the 
Biodiversity Outcomes Framework in 2006 and now, the 2020 biodiversity goals and targets.  Mainstreaming biodiversity 
Canada has a long history of supporting the mainstreaming of biodiversity into productive sectors. This includes efforts to incorporate biodiversity considerations into the agricultural, fisheries, forestry and tourism sectors. Canada is working to improve policy coherence by integrating actions for conserving biodiversity with other environmental

\0xEF 9% of the worldis forests, including about 270 million hectares of boreal forest
\0xEF 25% of the worldis wetlands
\0xEF 37% of the worldis total lake area
\0xEF 673 species of birds
\0xEF some of the largest remaining herds of free-ranging caribou and other large mammals, such as polar bears
and socio-economic objectives. For instance, Canada has established a pan-Canadian working group to address issues of climate change and biodiversity loss in a coordinated way, and to promote the integration of biodiversity considerations into climate change decisions. 
In 2018, the Government of Canada committed $1.3 billion over 5 years to protect Canadais Nature Legacy, representing one of the most significant investments in nature conservation in Canadian history.
The funding will allow Canada, working closely with its partners, to make progress in securing land for conservation, support federal, provincial and territorial efforts to protect species and support Indigenous capacity to conserve land and species.

Federal Sustainable  
Development Strategy
Sustainably managed lands and forests is one of 13 goals in Canadais Federal Sustainable Development 
Strategy (FSDS). Highlighted in the FSDS are targets for conserving terrestrial areas and inland water, maintaining the ecological integrity of national parks and maintaining Canadais annual timber harvest at or below sustainable wood supply levels. With partners, progress has been made to increase the area of Canadais lands and inland waters that are conserved. The integrity of Canadais national parksi ecosystems is also improving, and the timer harvest remains at sustainable levels. Sustainable forest management
About two thirds of Canadais species of plants, animals and microorganisms live in the forest. Canadais federal, provincial and territorial governments promote proactive, long-term species and biodiversity protection, including through legislation and policies, certification, participation in science and research initiatives and stakeholder engagement. 
Canada is a world leader in the development and application of sustainable forest management (SFM) practices. SFM in Canada is based on rigorous laws and regulations, scientific research, monitoring, planning and public participation. This includes developing science-based forest management plans that ensure that harvested wood does not exceed sustainable wood supply. All areas harvested on public lands are required to be regenerated.

Sustainability in the  agricultural sector
The Canadian Agricultural Partnership, launched in 2017, is a 5-year, $3-billion investment by federal, provincial and territorial governments to strengthen the agriculture, agri-food and agri-based products sector, ensuring continued innovation, growth and prosperity. The Partnership will support sustainable growth in the sector, aiming to enhance competitiveness while achieving progress on environmental sustainability and climate change mitigation and adaptation. Specifically, these investments are supporting the resiliency and sustainability of the sector, helping farmers adapt to climate change, conserve water 
and soil resources, and grow their businesses sustainably to meet increasing global food demand.  
Wetlands conservation and restoration
The North American Waterfowl Management Plan (NAWMP), an international action plan to conserve migratory birds throughout Canada, the United States and Mexico, is the cornerstone of wetland and waterfowl conservation in Canada. Since its creation, NAWMP partners have worked to conserve and restore wetlands, associated uplands and other key habitats for waterfowl across North America. The influence of NAWMP partners has been wide ranging: shaping land-use, agricultural and public policies; integrating science and monitoring systems into planning; and delivering habitat programs.
Millions of hectares of wetlands have been conserved as part of Canadais network of protected areas, established by governments, and other types of conservation areas established by private land owners, conservation organizations and local communities. Despite these efforts, declines and degradation continue. Continued commitment and collaboration moving forward will be vital.
Conserving and managing wildlife
The customary use of biological resources, such as hunting, fishing, trapping and gathering, is an important element of the intimate cultural relationship many Indigenous peoples in Canada have with nature. In settled land-claim areas in Canada, the responsibility for wildlife management is shared between governments, harvesters and wildlife management boards. The boards 

use traditional and local knowledge and scientific information to make recommendations to governments on management decisions affecting wildlife within their respective settlement areas. 
Canada has a robust legal framework for conserving and managing wildlife. The Species at Risk Act legally protects endangered or threatened organisms and their habitats. This federal law is complemented by laws and policies in provinces and territories. A range of funding programs such as the Habitat Stewardship Program support on-theground action in Canada to conserve and restore habitat and address threats to species at risk. 
Roughly 80% of the nearly 30,000 assessed species are considered secure and 20% are at some level of risk of extinction. Concerted effort by all levels of government and conservation partners is essential to ensure improvements in the condition of species and meet the objectives laid out in recovery strategies for species at risk. 
Invasive alien species
National-level cooperation on invasive alien species (IAS) prevention, early detection and rapid response, and management is strong, but continued collaborative effort is necessary among federal departments, provincial and territorial governments and 
Elmwood Elementary 
School\0xF3Danielle 
\0xECElmwoodis grade 5 girls prepared school projects to identify solutions that could help achieve the SDGs. I (Danielle) chose to do elephant and rhino poaching for my exhibition. There arenit many rhinos and elephants left on Earth. 
My solution is to make a \0xEBTiny Tracker.i This Tiny Tracker can be placed inside a rhinois horn or an elephantis tusk. It also has a sensor along the tracker. The Tiny Tracker will be placed inside a horn and sealed. There will be an app that shows where the horn is. If the sensor senses a lot of vibrations like the kind a chainsaw would create, it will turn red on the screen. This will help save animals because you can arrest all the poachers so no more rhinos and elephants can be killed for their horns or tusks.
Polar bear management in Canada 

Canada is home to roughly two thirds of the worldis polar bears. The Polar Bear Administrative Committee (PBAC), formed in 1969, is a forum for Canadian jurisdictions to work together to manage polar bears in Canada. PBAC is made up of representatives from the federal, provincial and territorial governments, partners that share legal responsibility for the management of polar bears under land claims agreements and organizations representing Indigenous peoples. 
other stakeholders to prevent the introduction of new species and diseases in Canada. Pathways for IAS in Canada are generally understood, but risks and priorities vary regionally. An effective national regulatory framework is in place. In recent years, legislative and regulatory tools to prevent and control invasive species have been strengthened, and Canada has renewed its commitment to advance collaborative work among governments and partners on invasive alien species.
Canada and the world
Forestry initiatives
The Government of Canada is an active participant in the Montr\0xC8al Process Working Group, a voluntary intergovernmental process that develops and implements harmonized criteria and indicators that measure progress toward sustainable forest management in 90% of boreal and temperate forests across the globe. Canada continues to champion the Model Forest approach, which was developed in Canada in the early 1990s and supports a participatory, landscape-level approach to the sustainable management of forest resources. Today, there are 70 model forests in 36 countries that cover an area of more than 100 million hectares and are linked through the International Model Forest Network 
(IMFN). Natural Resources Canadais Canadian Forest Service provides the IMFN Secretariat.  
Combatting desertification and land degradation
Canada renewed its commitment to the UN Convention to Combat Desertification in 2017. Canada will continue its work on soil restoration and nutrient management issues in inland freshwater ecosystems. The Government of Canadais Drought Watch initiative allows farmers to access accurate and current soil moisture information and predictive tools to optimally manage their growing and harvesting operations, helping to inform when supplemental irrigation may be required.

Genetic resources
The Government of Canada has built a critical mass of knowledge, expertise and science capacity to study organisms of importance for agriculture and shares information on its holdings of plant and animal genetic resources collections using websites and other tools. Canada has made investments to accelerate the DNA analysis, data capture and imaging of specimens from its collections. This work aims to improve public accessibility to the governmentis collections, support research in climate change and improve rapid identification and prevention of threats to agriculture. 
As part of its commitment under the 
International Treaty of Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, the Government of Canada manages the Plant Gene Resources of Canada (PGRC), a network that preserves the genetic diversity of crop plants and their wild relatives important to Canadian agriculture. In recent years, the PGRC distributed 22,846 seed samples to gene bank clients in 33 countries. The Canadian Collection of Fungal Cultures is the largest collection for fungal genetic resources in Canada, maintaining over 17,000 living cultures and representing over 7,500 species. The Government of Canada also manages the National Tree Seed Centre and coordinates the pan-Canadian group CONFORGEN, which aims to conserve the genetic resources of native tree species.

Goal-by-goal actions
SDG 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels 

Canada is a staunch supporter of 
SDG 16. Its inclusion among the SDGs represents a milestone: that ensuring that peace, justice and strong institutions are prerequisites to sustainable development. In line with the integrated and indivisible nature of the 2030 Agenda, SDG 16 also has strong links to many other goals. It is widely understood that SDG 16 should not be seen in isolation; in all, 36 targets directly measure an aspect of peace, inclusion or access to justice, with only one third of these found in SDG 16. 
Canada is a parliamentary democracy. Respect for the rule of law, good governance and peace are the foundational principles of our country, including a bedrock belief that all people are equal under the law. This idea is at the centre of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Access to justice for all is critical to ensure that the protections afforded by the rule of law do not exclude the most vulnerable of our society. 
For Canada, an informed and engaged citizenry, trust in a fair process and transparency are key elements of our democracy. Transparent and accountable institutions and organizations strengthen the fabric of society. Democracy, inclusive and accountable governance, peaceful pluralism and respect for diversity and human rights\0xF3core values shared continued support is needed to establish and maintain peace and security, both for the safety of citizens and as a precondition for sustainable development. Canada is committed to helping countries to reduce threats, facilitate stability and promote inclusive peace processes. Canadian context
Homicide rates in Canada have been declining on the whole since the 1990s, though gang-related homicides have increased over the last two 
years. The majority of Canadians are satisfied (50%) or very satisfied (38%) with their personal safety from crime. However, women\0xF3especially young women\0xF3feel less safe than men and are more likely to take steps to protect themselves. Immigrants and racialized communities also generally had a lower sense of safety than other Canadians.10
Check Your Head 
Check Your Head is a youthdriven, not-for-profit organization whose mission is to educate, activate and empower young people to engage in justice movements to create a more equitable, democratic and sustainable future. By supporting youth leadership in advancing the SDGs, in collaboration with educational institutions, community organizations and others, they ensure that young peopleis voices are included in a meaningful way, and that there are opportunities for all to engage.
In Canada, the rule of law is strong, but there continue to be groups of people who experience discrimination and harassment. Recent reports indicate that lesbian, gay and bisexual individuals are significantly more likely to experience violent victimization.
Indigenous women and girls in Canada are disproportionately affected by all forms of violence. Numerous reports and studies on violence toward Indigenous women in Canada have identified underlying causes, including socioeconomic factors such as poverty and homelessness, as well as historic factors such as racism, sexism, the legacy of colonialism and the devastation caused by the Indian Residential School system.

Marginalized and vulnerable groups may have greater difficulty accessing justice. They may face multiple barriers, including language issues, a lack of legal literacy, weaker social networks and a lack of resources. It is also a greater challenge to access justice in remote areas of the country where the justice infrastructure is not available.
Rising to the challenge
The Government of Canada collaborates with a range of partners in Canada and abroad to promote peaceful and inclusive societies, provide access to justice for all, build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions, and promote transparency.
The Government recognizes that access to justice is a foundation of Canadian society and is investing in strengthening the Canadian judiciary, supporting Canadais court system and enhancing openness and transparency.
Enhancing Canadais national security and safeguarding Canadiansi rights and freedoms are a core component of the Government of Canadais approach. In addition, the Government supports and promotes safer communities across the country by implementing evidence-based policies and programs in crime prevention, policing and corrections, with a focus on the specific needs of vulnerable communities and atrisk groups. 
The Government of Canada is committed to transparency and to evidence-based, inclusive decision making. Equipping governments and Canadians with sound data and upto-date information are essential to a healthy democracy.  
National security 
The Government of Canada is reviewing its national security framework to improve the accountability and effectiveness of national security and intelligence agencies, and ensure that the principles of equality, diversity and inclusion underpin all activities. The Government is also developing new national security legislation that strikes a balance between protecting fundamental rights and protecting the safety and security of Canadians. The Government is taking action to increase the representation of women and other under-represented groups in fields such as the judiciary, law enforcement, security and intelligence. 
In 2017, the Government of Canada launched the Canada Centre for Community Engagement and 
Prevention of Violence to provide national leadership on Canadais efforts to prevent radicalization to violence. The Canada Centre is working with all levels of government, civil society organizations, international partners, the private sector, academia, youth, law enforcement and front-line practitioners to develop programs tailored to local needs and strengths, and to evaluate what works and does not, for countering radicalization to violence. 
Crime prevention
Through the National Crime Prevention Strategy, Canada supports the implementation of communitybased crime prevention initiatives that address early risk factors among vulnerable populations and respond to priority crime issues, such as youth gangs/violence, hate crimes, bullying/ cyberbullying and exit strategies for prostitution. Canada also provides funding to enhance the safety of Indigenous women and girls and 
to support the rehabilitation and reintegration of Indigenous offenders through Aboriginal Community Safety Planning and the Indigenous Community Corrections Initiative.  
Combatting organized crime, money laundering and terrorist financing, corruption and bribery
Using an intelligence-led, integrated approach, Canada aims to reduce the threat and impact of organized crime in a sustained effort to disrupt and dismantle todayis criminal groups. The Initiative to Take Action against Guns and Gangs will invest in communities and enhance Canadais capacity to stem the flow of transnational organized crime members and illegal firearms entering Canada. 
Canada works with stakeholders to prevent, detect and investigate bribery and corruption, and help industry, governments and organizations mitigate their exposure to these crimes. Canadais laws aim to detect and deter money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities, for example through mandatory reporting of suspicious financial transactions, while facilitating the investigation and prosecution of these crimes.  Access to justice
The Government of Canada is undertaking a broad review of Canadais criminal justice system. The review will address a number of important issues, including reducing the over-representation of vulnerable populations. As part of this process, the Government is consulting with Canadians and working with the provinces and territories to identify reforms that can make the Canadian justice system more accessible, relevant and fair. The Government of Canada has established the Working Group of Ministers to review relevant federal laws, policies and operational practices to help ensure the Government is meeting its constitutional obligations with respect to Indigenous and treaty rights, adhering to international human rights standards and supporting the implementation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commissionis Calls to Action.
The Government of Canada supports access to justice, particularly for economically disadvantaged persons, through its Legal Aid Program. Moreover, in Budget 2018, the Government committed $50 million over 5 years to provide outreach to, and legal aid for, victims of sexual harassment in the workplace. 
The Government supports Indigenous community-based justice programs that offer culturally relevant alternatives to the mainstream justice process in appropriate circumstances through the Indigenous Justice Program. 
The Victims Fund provides grants and contributions to support projects and activities that encourage the development of new approaches, promote access to justice, improve the capacity of service providers, foster the establishment of referral networks and/or increase awareness of services available to victims of crime and their families.  
Transparent and accountable institutions
Transparent and accountable institutions and organizations strengthen the fabric of society and assist in attracting investment. The Government of Canada is committed to improving, strengthening and protecting Canadais democratic institutions. 
Legislation introduced in June 2017 (Bill C-58), seeks to strengthen openness and transparency by providing Canadais information commissioner with greater powers, improving the request-based system and legally entrenching proactive publication across government. The Government has also introduced legislation to make political party fundraising activities more open and transparent.
In the 2018 federal budget, the 
Government proposes to provide $7.1 million over 5 years, beginning in 2018-2019, and $1.5 million per year ongoing, to support the work of the Office of the Commissioner of Canada Elections. This funding will help ensure that the Canadian electoral process continues to uphold the highest standards of democracy. In April 2018, Canada introduced the Elections Modernization Act, to make the electoral system more accessible, transparent and secure.  
Reconciliation with Indigenous peoples
Building strong, culturally appropriate institutions is not only an essential part of Canadais path to reconciliation with Indigenous peoples, it is a precondition for Canadais implementation of all 17 Sustainable Development Goals.
National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls

In December 2015, the Government of Canada announced it would establish a Commission of Inquiry to seek recommendations on concrete actions to address and prevent violence against Indigenous women and girls.
Following an extensive engagement with families, survivors and stakeholders, the 
Inquiry was launched in August 2016 and provided a budget of $53.86 million and a 2-year mandate. The Inquiry has been cross-appointed by all Canadian provinces and territories, making it the first truly national inquiry in Canadian history. 
On June 5, 2018, the Government announced it would provide the Inquiry with an extension to ensure it has time to hear from families and survivors of violence, while balancing the need for it to make timely recommendations on concrete measures to improve the safety of Indigenous women and girls. At the same time, the Government announced new initiatives to respond to the recommendations of the Inquiryis November 2017 report. The Government will provide greater health and victim services supports for families and survivors, establish a commemoration fund to honour the lives and legacies of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, and support efforts to review police policies and practices.
An important component of Canadais progress on Goal 16 relates to the self-determination of Indigenous peoples, which is an inherent right and a necessary condition if social and economic disparities are to be addressed. It gives communities the autonomy to administer their affairs in a manner consistent with their own unique political structures, priorities and capacities. 
For First Nations, Inuit and M\0xC8tis in Canada, there is no single route to self-determination and each community and nation will continue their own path toward becoming vibrant, strong and self-governing communities. 
The Government supports this vital work in a number of areas. The 2018 federal budget included investments to support the important work of reconstituting nations in a manner that responds to the unique 

priorities and needs of Indigenous communities\0xF3an objective outlined in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.  
Migration
The Government of Canada recognizes the importance of planned and well-managed migration policies for achieving SDG 16is goal of \0xECpeaceful and inclusive societies. Canadais national migration system includes temporary and permanent pathways to Canada for work, study, family unification and protection. Ensuring that newcomers integrate and contribute to Canadais economy and communities remains a Government of Canada priority, recognizing that if such integration is not fostered, it can lead to tensions between migrant and host communities. 
To achieve this objective, Canadais settlement program provides support to newcomers to facilitate their migration transition period, learn English or French, find meaningful employment and establish themselves in their welcoming communities. Reflecting Canadais commitment to diversity and inclusion, the Government of Canada also encourages all permanent residents to acquire Canadian citizenship and benefit from permanently belonging in Canadian society.  
Preventing and addressing violence, discrimination and harassment
The Government of Canada is taking action to eliminate genderbased violence. In June 2017, the Government launched Itis Time: 
Canadais Strategy to Prevent and Address Gender-Based Violence, a whole-of-government response to GBV based on prevention, support for survivors and their families and promotion of responsive legal and justice systems. 

SDG indicators 16.3.1  Proportion of victims of violence in the previous 12 months who reported their victimization to competent authorities or other officially recognized conflict resolution mechanisms
Percentage of incidents of violent crime reported to police
to protect children from sexual exploitation and cyberbullying. In July 2015, the Tougher Penalties for Child 
Predators Act amended the Criminal Code, including by increasing and imposing new mandatory minimum penalties for child sexual offences. The Government of Canadais efforts to combat online child sexual exploitation include funding to enhance the capacity to respond to public reporting and to support an increased rate of removal of child sexual abuse materials online.
enacted or introduced amendments to include gender identity as prohibited grounds of discrimination in their antidiscrimination legislation. In addition, in 2017, Parliament amended the Criminal Code to protect against hate propaganda and hate crimes on the basis of gender identity or expression. Governments are also reviewing how they collect, use and display sex and gender information to reduce the risk of transgender, two-spirit and nonbinary persons facing harassment or discrimination.  
Action Committee on Access to Justice in Civil and Family Matters 
The Action Committee on Access to Justice in Civil and Family Matters is a national coordinating body that facilitates communication and collaboration on access to civil and family law across Canada. It works to connect, support and highlight the work of the individuals, organizations and institutions working at a regional or local level. The Committee has articulated nine justice development goals around which to mobilize efforts and help improve access to justice. The Committee has been involved in hundreds of initiatives across Canada in order to make progress on these goals. While the Committeeis work relates most directly to SDG 16, access to justice is foundational to the realization of many of the other SDGs; the Committeeis justice development goals, therefore, help to advance several SDGs. 

Canada and the world
Countries around the world have benefited from a global order based on rules that have at their heart the notions of inclusion, democracy and respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms, diversity and the rule of law. Canada recognizes the importance of such an order and views it as central to the maintenance and development of free, open, well-governed, pluralistic, peaceful and prosperous societies. As part of its commitment to strengthening the rules-based order, Canada is reinforcing these core values at home and abroad.
Co-founded by the Aga Khan 
Development Network and the 
Government of Canada, the Global Centre for Pluralismis (GCP) mission is to promote pluralism as a fundamental human value and cornerstone of peace, stability and development. Canadais contribution to the GCP has helped expand the evidence base on the effects of inclusion and exclusion in order to help provide governments, decision makers and civil society actors with information to inform sound policies, programs and responsiveness to pluralism issues.
Canada has committed to work in close collaboration with a range of partners to pursue action on security challenges such as non-proliferation, counter terrorism and the fight against organized crime. Through our diplomatic activities and our international assistance, Canada is taking concrete actions to prevent and respond to conflicts abroad and to support UN peace operations in building a more peaceful and prosperous world.
The action areas of Canadais 
Feminist International Assistance 
Policy reflect the importance of SDG 
16 in achieving Canadais vision for international assistance. To support inclusive governance, Canada will work to end gender discrimination by promoting and protecting human rights, advancing the rule of law, and building stronger institutions. Canada will also encourage greater political participation by women and girls. Canadian international assistance for peace and security contributes to broader feminist foreign policy and links to defence, trade and domestic policies. 
Canada has been among the strongest proponents internationally of the Women, Peace and Security Agenda and has a long history of advocating for and supporting gender equality, of promoting the empowerment of women and girls, of calling for the protection of their human rights, and of ending sexual and genderbased violence, including in conflict settings. Launched in November 2017, Canadais second National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security (20172022) is more inclusive, transparent, and ambitious than the first; it has a strengthened focus on gender equality, government partnership and strengthened cooperation with civil society. A complementary initiative\0xF3 the Elsie Initiative on Women in Peace Operations\0xF3seeks to overcome the barriers to womenis meaningful participation in peace operations.
Through the Group of Friends of 
Corrections in Peace Operations, Canada is leading the delivery of international women-centered training on the treatment of women prisoners.
The Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) has helped keep the peace in other parts of the world for more than 60 years. Canada sends the CAF in support of the United Nations and other countries to restore peace and security in areas of conflict. The CAF will support the implementation of Canadais National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security to help advance the role of women and girls in all stages of peace support operations and protect their human rights in fragile, conflict or postconflict countries. To that end, the CAF will contribute to a transformation of peace support operations, promoting better representation of women in the forces and the integration of gender perspectives in all levels of planning. 
Canadian police have been participating in international peacekeeping missions since 1989. Since that time, more than 4,000 Canadian police officers have participated in over 66 peace support operations. They are currently deployed to Haiti, Iraq, Ukraine and the West Bank. By building the capacity of foreign police to maintain law and order, Canadian police, in cooperation with international partners, help create a safer and more stable global environment.
Canadais Anti-Crime Capacity Building Program aims to enhance the capacity of states, government entities and international organizations to prevent and respond to threats posed by transnational criminal activity. Currently, the Program is most heavily engaged in Central America and the Caribbean, with some programming in Mexico and South America. For example, military and police units trained through Canadiansupported projects in El Salvador have been active in supporting the countryis attorney general to investigate and prosecute a number of high-profile cases.
Canadais Counter-Terrorism Capacity Building Program assists states, international and non-governmental organizations to prevent and respond to terrorist activity, in a manner consistent with international counter-terrorism and human rights obligations, norms and standards. Canada is currently funding 
1001 Nights: Building Childrenis Resilience to Violence, which is strengthening Tunisian youthsi resilience to violent narratives through increased education and engagement with positive human values. Posttests after the first year of curriculum implementation found that childrenis intolerance of outside groups (based on religion, race, social class) has gone down from 34% to 22%.
Canada is a vocal advocate in support of ending violence, exploitation and abuse against children and youth and works closely with multilateral institutions, country governments and Canadian civil society to prevent and respond to all forms of violence against girls and boys. Canada supports programming and advocacy initiatives on child protection, including child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation/cutting, both at the country level and with strategic partners such as Girls Not Brides, UNFPA, the Global Partnership to End Violence against Children and the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict. Additionally, Canada was a founding endorser of the Vancouver Principles on Peacekeeping and the Prevention of the Recruitment and Use of Child Soldiers.
Under Canadais G7 presidency, the Charlevoix G7 Summit Communique highlighted the importance of eradicating trafficking in persons and forced labour. Canada supports developing countries in their efforts to tackle root causes and reduce vulnerabilities, especially for women and girls at risk of being trafficked, by strengthening their labour laws, public health, education and child protection systems, as well as building the capacity of law enforcement and justice systems. In September 2017, Canada endorsed the U.K.is \0xECCall to 
Action to End Forced Labour, Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking.
Through its international assistance, Canada is supporting other countries as they reform their justice systems and efforts to help improve peopleis access to justice in their communities. A study supported by Canadais IDRC is also generating new evidence on the different options available for scaling-up access to basic legal services and meeting related SDG 16 targets in low- and middle-income countries in Africa.
The Government of Canada also supported a project implemented by the Justice Studies Centre of the Americas to increase access to equitable and efficient civil justice that respects the rights of those involved in legal proceedings. In 2017-2018, 770 (including 412 women) government and civil society representatives were trained on issues related to accessible, efficient and equitable civil justice system reform.
Canada promotes effective, accountable and inclusive institutions through international assistance that strengthens public financial management, accountability, civil society engagement, publicsector transparency and access to information. For example, Canada is an active member of the Open Government Partnership (OGP), 
a global multilateral initiative with the core objective of securing solid commitments from governments to promote transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption and harness new technologies to strengthen governance, in partnership with civil society and the private sector. In September 2017, Canada became cochair of the OGP Steering Committee and will take over the lead chair in October 2018. Further, under the G7 
Charlevoix Commitment on Defending 
Democracy from Foreign Threats, Canada has committed to ensuring a high level of transparency of the funding sources for political parties and all types of political advertising.  
Next steps  
\0xEF Complete criminal justice system review. 
\0xEF Support provincial/territorial and community-based initiatives to deal more effectively with guns-andgangs, including tighter restrictions, heightened enforcement and the detection and interdiction of illicit firearms across the border.
\0xEF Support the Canadian Centre for Child Protection to combat online exploitation of children as part of Canadais Strategy to Prevent and Address Gender-Based Violence.
\0xEF In October 2018, Canada will take over the lead government co-chair of the Open Government Partnership, and will seek to focus the OGP on three priorities of inclusion, participation and impact. Canada will also contribute $4M to the Open Government Partnership Multi-Donor Trust Fund, a new partnership between the OGP and World Bank that aims to support developing countries to meet their open government commitments while promoting transparency, tackling corruption, and empowering communities.
\0xEF In the Fall of 2018, Canada will table in Parliament its annual public progress report on the implementation of the Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security.

Goal-by-goal actions
SDG 17: Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development

Canada is pursuing an ambitious and coherent agenda for sustainable social, economic and environmental change at home and abroad. Working in close partnership with other states, civil society and international and private-sector organizations, Canada contributes actively to global efforts to eradicate poverty and build a more peaceful, more inclusive and more prosperous world. In response to increasingly dynamic and complex sustainable development challenges, Canada remains committed to joint action and leadership, offering innovative and results-driven solutions.
Canada sees the new global agenda on sustainable development as a critical opportunity to reassess existing approaches and pursue new partnerships. Through its 
many contributions to shaping the 2030 Agenda, the Paris Agreement, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on financing for development, the Sendai Framework for Action on 
Disaster Risk Reduction and the 
World Humanitarian Summitis Grand Bargain, Canada worked hard to shape a new and positive framework so that the remarkable development gains that have been achieved by some can be shared by all. 
Underpinning Canadais commitment to implementing the 2030 Agenda are initiatives that support the realization of all the SDGs. Partnerships, innovative financing, science and technology transfers and data transparency are just some of the ways that Canada has made progress in SDG 17. 

The SDGs cannot be achieved without broad and inclusive partnerships, as sustainable solutions cannot come from one sector acting in isolation. That is why the Government of Canada works with a broad range of partners, domestic and international, toward SDG achievement. 
Canada supports meaningful and active engagement with the civil society sector and continues to be a strong advocate for fostering a safe and enabling environment in which civil society can thrive around the world. These priorities are affirmed in Canadais Policy for Civil Society Partnerships for International 
Assistance n A Feminist Approach 
(the CSO Policy), which outlines Canadais commitment to working 
collaboratively with the civil society sector. Launched in September 2017, the CSO Policy ensures that Canadais approach to partnerships with civil society is aligned with the Feminist International Assistance Policy, placing gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls at the CSO Policyis heart, and under the framework of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. A joint advisory group between civil society organizations and Global Affairs Canada was established to support effective CSO Policy implementation and encourage discussions on CSO Policy implementation in an open and collaborative environment. 
Canadais International Development 
Research Centre supports Southern Voice, a network of 50 think tanks from Africa, Asia and Latin America that addresses existing knowledge and power imbalances by supporting more inclusive participation of different actors in global development debates. It leverages quality, local data and evidence generated by the Global South to give them a voice and increase the impact of the 2030 Agenda. Southern Voice recently launched the State of the SDGs Initiative, which aims to improve the SDG review process and promote learning based on contextualized knowledge; its first report is expected in July 2019.
Canada has been steadily expanding its engagement with the private sector, in support of sustainable development, including through policy forums like the 2018 G7 presidency and Group of Friends of SDG Financing, as well as through a growing number of partnerships with the private sector and innovative development policy and programming.
Canada is also expanding its toolkit to support private-sector engagement and resource mobilization in support of the SDGs. To this end, Canada is drafting new policy guidance to engage the private sector and facilitate private investment, both in Canada through a social innovation and social finance strategy, and in frontier markets with an innovative financing policy to implement the Feminist International Assistance Policy.
Through the Womenis Program, the Government supports Canadian organizations working at the national, regional and local levels to create conditions for success for women in Canada. The Womenis Program facilitates collaboration and networking, develops partnerships to address horizontal issues affecting women and girls, shares knowledge and helps eligible organizations to gain access to expertise, resources and tools. The 2018 federal budget announced an additional $100 million over 5 years to enhance the Programis 
Alliance 2030 
Alliance 2030 is a newly launched network of organizations committed to achieving the 17 SDGs by 2030. The concept behind Alliance 2030 is the power of togetherness. It is building a searchable database of work being done across Canada that align to the SDGs. This digital space will allow member organizations to easily connect with like-minded Canadians so they can share lessons learned, find the support they need and stay up-to-date on the current state of Canadian progress on the SDGs.
ability to support the sustainability of equality-seeking organizations by increasing organizational and sector capacity and ensuring better funding for organizations focused on vulnerable women.
Well-planned and well-managed immigration is essential for inclusive and sustainable economic growth and long-term prosperity. Canada works with provinces, territories, over 500 civil society organizations and the public to support the successful integration of immigrants and refugees into Canadian society through the design and delivery of settlement services, including:  
\0xEF Orientation to support informed decision making and understand Canadais laws and institutions;
\0xEF Employment-related services, e.g. job searches, networking, foreign credential recognition; and 
\0xEF Language training.
In 2016-2017, more than 424,000 immigrants and refugees accessed at least one of these settlement services. 
To deliver on its refugee resettlement commitments, Canada works with international organizations including the UN Refugee Agency and the International Organization for Migration. Canada resettles the most-vulnerable refugees through the GovernmentAssisted Refugees Program, where refugees receive 12 months of government support, as well as through the Blended Visa Office-Referred Program, where refugees receive joint support from the Government and a private sponsor. In addition, Canadais Private Sponsorship of Refugees Program enables Canadian citizens and permanent residents to sponsor individual refugee families during their first year in Canada. In 2017, almost 27,000 refugees were resettled in Canada through these partnerships. Canada also encourages and promotes the development of public-private partnerships to increase refugee protection spaces around the world through the Global Refugee Sponsorship Initiative.
Financing the SDGs and a more prosperous world for all  
Achieving SDG targets requires predictable and robust investment across all sectors in Canada. To maximize the potential of these investments, traditional and innovative financing mechanisms are required.  Official development assistance
As set out in the Feminist International Assistance Policy, the Government targets international assistance to the poorest and most vulnerable. With half of the worldis poorest citizens living in sub-Saharan Africa, Canada committed to ensure that 50% of its bilateral international development assistance is directed to sub-Saharan African countries by 2021-2022. 
Canadais international assistance exceeds $5 billion annually. The 2018 federal budget announced an additional $2 billion in new funding for international assistance over 5 years to support implementation of the Policy. Through this policy, Canada prioritizes the investments, partnerships and advocacy efforts that have the greatest potential to close gender gaps, eliminate barriers to gender equality and help achieve the SDGs. 
The Government of Canada recently announced it would invest up to $300 million to leverage contributions from the private sector, investors and philanthropic organizations to support the advancement of gender equality and the empowerment of women and 
International Institute for Sustainable Development 
The International Institute for Sustainable Development is an independent think tank that champion sustainable solutions to 21st century problems. The Institute developed Canadais first community indicator system, Peg, in collaboration with the United Way of Winnipeg. Peg presents data on key indicators of community well-being. Individuals, community groups and organizations in all sectors can use the information to guide collective action to achieve progress for their communities and the SDGs. 
girls in developing countries. This initiative will draw on the strengths of the Government, the philanthropic community, the private sector and civil society to mobilize unprecedented resource levels.
In collaboration with the Government of Canada, a group of leading global institutional investors, led by the Caisse de d\0xC8p\0xD9t et placement du 
Qu\0xC8bec (CDPQ) and the Ontario Teachersi Pension Plan (OTPP), launched a leadership initiative for international development in June 2018. The initiative brings together major institutional investors from across G7 countries to help address some of the big challenges that limit growth that benefits everyone, including the lack of women in leadership positions; a persistent global infrastructure gap, especially in emerging markets; and the threats to growth posed by climate change.
Taking more innovative approaches to international assistance will also be an essential part of Canadais Feminist International Assistance Policy. In addition to the new international assistance resources announced in Budget 2018, the Government will provide $1.5 billion over 5 years, starting in 2018-2019, from existing unallocated International Assistance Envelope resources, to support innovation in Canadais international assistance through two new programs:
\0xEF The International Assistance Innovation Program will give the Government greater flexibility for financing arrangements and partnerships and ensure Canada remains at the leading edge of development financing.
\0xEF The Sovereign Loans Program, a pilot program, will diversify the tools Canada has to engage partner countries and international development organizations. It will also better align Canadais international assistance toolkit with that of other donors.
Canada is also pursuing new and innovative approaches in support of development objectives, for example through the creation of FinDev Canada, capitalized at $300 million. Launched in 2018, FinDev Canada will provide a full suite of financial services to the private sector in developing countries that will generate sustainable economic development, advance gender equality and womenis economic empowerment, and address climate change mitigation and adaptation. It will prioritize activities in high development-impact areas, such as green growth, agribusiness and support for small and medium-sized enterprises. 
Under Canadais 2018 G7 presidency, the G7 Charlevoix Commitment on Innovative Financing for Development outlines an approach to promote economic growth in developing economies and foster greater equality of opportunity within and between countries. The Commitment supports innovative financing approaches and new international development partnerships to achieve greater sustainable development outcomes, explores opportunities to enhance the economic resilience of vulnerable developing countries to extreme weather events and other hazards, affirms that bilateral Development Finance Institutions are important actors in mobilizing  private sector financing for the achievement of sustainable development outcomes, and supports development finance programs that strive to advance womenis economic empowerment. G7 Development and Finance Ministers met together in Whistler to advance innovative financing for development. Domestic resource mobilization
Canada is working hard to better leverage its development assistance to help countries build effective tax systems for domestic resource mobilization and attract new sources of capital in support of sustainable development. 
An effective tax system is essential for domestic resource mobilization, which enables countries to generate resources to finance their own sustainable development. Canada continues to support projects that encourage sustainable resource mobilization in developing countries by providing access to technical assistance and expertise in tax administration. The Knowledge Sharing Platform for Tax Administrations, for example, is used by more than 2,000 officials from over 100 developing and emerging economies. Additionally:  
\0xEF Under the Addis Tax Initiative, Canada and other donors committed to a collective doubling of international assistance for domestic resource mobilization by 2020.
\0xEF Canada contributes to international efforts to combat tax evasion by automatically exchanging information on financial accounts held by non-residents, starting in September 2018. 
\0xEF Large multinational enterprises in Canada are now required to file country-by-country reports containing information on their global allocation of income and taxes, as well as the nature of their global business activities, as recommended by the OECD/G20is 
Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project. Canada contributes to international efforts to address corporate tax avoidance by automatically exchanging these reports, starting in June 2018.  
Global economic system
The Government of Canada advocates for enhanced macroeconomic stability through stronger multilateralism and openness, and the promotion of cooperative solutions that foster more inclusive and sustainable growth and advance gender equality and women and girlsi economic empowerment.




Canadais vibrant civil society: Workin
Civil society organizations across Canada are working to raise public awareness and mobilize people around the SDGs and to encourage government leadership on the 2030 Agenda. 
Community Foundations of Canada 
(CFC) is the national network for Canadais 191 community foundations. Together, they help Canadians invest in making their communities better places to live, work and play. Community foundations are able to identify issues at the local level 	\0xEF and respond with community investments to initiate change in a way that national or international organizations may not be placed to do. From 2016 to 2017, community foundations led the Community Fund for Canadais 150th anniversary, a program that has provided communities with thousands of small grants to support local projects across Canada\0xF3including 53 projects with a specific focus on women and girls. CFC also focuses on shaping the emerging field of impact investing in Canada, mobilizing the strength of philanthropic and charitable organizations in collaboration with the private sector and 	\0xEF government to achieve greater impact for Canadian communities.
The Inter-Council Network (ICN) is a coalition of the eight provincial and regional councils for international cooperation. These independent, memberbased councils represent nearly 400 diverse civil society organizations from across Canada. The councils are working to advance the SDGs in Canada and globally; for example:
\0xEF The British Columbia Council for International Cooperation (BCCIC), along with the Korea Institute Center for Sustainable Development, SDSN Korea 
g to achieve the SDGs
and the Beyond Beijing Committee, launched the Global Invisible Mosaic at the 2017 High-Level Political Forum. This network of global organizations focuses on expanding civic participatory space, capacity building and grassroots SDG monitoring. BCCIC has also developed a number of tools and initiatives to localize the SDGs, including SDG scorecards to measure municipal progress on the SDGs.
The Alberta Council for Global 
Cooperation has embedded the 
SDGs within its strategic plan, using the global goals as a lens to inform and shape its programming. In 2017, the Council organized the first-ever multi-stakeholder forum in Canada on the 2030 Agenda to examine Canadais and Albertais progress on the SDGs, Together 2017. A second symposium this year will focus on SDG 5, recognizing that promoting gender equality and empowering women and girls is integral to all dimensions of inclusive and sustainable development.
The Manitoba Council for 
International Cooperation regularly incorporates the SDGs in its public engagement work, including through social media, educator professional development sessions, student workshops and fair trade outreach. The Councilis Generating Momentum for Our World student conferences focus on a new SDG each year, to educate students across Manitoba about global issues. The Council has created a pop-up photo booth and ran a contest encouraging Manitobans to promote awareness of the SDGs using social media.
The Canadian Council for International 
Cooperation (CCIC) is a coalition of 85 Canadian voluntary sector organizations working globally to achieve sustainable human development. In 2017, CCIC partnered with Community Foundations of Canada to host a series of National Conversations on Canada and the SDGs. This led to the formation of Alliance 2030, a newly launched network of organizations, institutions and individuals committed to achieving the SDGs in Canada and abroad, and a place to connect and collaborate. CCIC has also been actively advocating for Canada to launch its own national plan on the SDGs and has encouraged the review of the Federal Sustainable Development Act to put the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs at the heart of the Act.
To a large extent, the SDGs resonate with Canadians. One of the challenges faced by civil society, however, has been to encourage people to look outside their typical area of focus to see the connections between the different goals and the need for an integrated approach. Without seeing the spaces in between the different goals, there is a risk that organizations will simply continue with business as usual. In this vein, CCIC is working with the Waterloo Global Science Initiative and the newly established Sustainable Development Solutions NetworknCanada to encourage organizations to think of different approaches to address multiple goals. 

Canada is a key contributor to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and strongly supports the IMF in its role in ensuring global macroeconomic stability, a strong international monetary system and cooperative solutions to shared global challenges. To ensure the IMF is adequately resourced, Canada and 35 other countries temporarily boosted the Fundis available resources by about SDR11 300 billion until 2020. In 2017, Canada agreed to provide an additional SDR 8.2-billion, bilateral credit line. Canada also finalized an SDR 500 million loan to the IMFis Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust, which provides support to the IMFis poorest and most-vulnerable members.
Canada works with the G20, IMF and the Financial Stability Board to address data shortcomings in the financial sector. In 2017, Canada joined a small number of countries adhering to the Special Data Dissemination Standard Plus, the IMFis highest standard for data dissemination. Canada also cochairs the G20 Working Group on the Framework for Strong, Sustainable, Balanced and Inclusive Growth, which supports international economic policy coherence and collaboration.
Trade and least-developed countries
To promote economic growth in the worldis poorest countries, the Government of Canada has extended duty-free treatment to imports from least-developed countries (LDCs) through the Least Developed Country Tariff since 1983 (with the exception of certain agricultural products). In June 2017, Canada amended rules of origin requirements to allow more apparel products from LDCs, notably Haiti. Canada also fully meets its commitments at the WTO with respect to duty-free quota-free and preferential rules of origin for LDCs.
Canada is a founding donor and member of the publicnprivate Global Alliance for Trade Facilitation. The Alliance draws on public-sector funding and in-kind contributions to accelerate the WTO Agreement on Trade Facilitation implementation on projects in developing countries\0xF3 ultimately in view of growing and diversifying trade and fostering growth that benefits everyone. The Alliance is facilitated by a secretariat hosted by the World Economic Forum, International Chamber of Commerce and the Center of International Private Enterprise. 
Science and technology
Applying science and technology to sustainable development challenges can play a transformative role in alleviating poverty, advancing human rights, accelerating economic growth that benefits everyone and improving the quality of life in developing countries. For these reasons, Canada supports technological transfers to developing countries on mutually agreed upon terms.
Sustainable Development 
Solutions Network\0xF3 University of Waterloo 
The Canadian branch of the 
Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), hosted at the University of Waterloo, is part of a global movement to build a network of universities, research centres, civil society organizations and knowledge institutions. The SDSN works closely with UN agencies, multilateral financing institutions, the private sector and 

Canada, its second-largest donor, is civil society, thus opening up many contributing $10 million between 2015 opportunities for collaboration. In and 2022. There are 5 Alliance projects

11 SDR: special drawing rights, the IMFis unit of account 

Strengthening the capacity of publicly funded science granting councils is critical for making continued gains in global science, technology and innovation (STI) development. Canadais 5-year, Science Granting Councils Initiative strengthens the capacity of 15 sub-Saharan science granting councils to monitor research programs based on robust STI indicators, promote knowledge exchange with the private sector and establish partnerships with other science systems. 
Canadais IDRC launched initiatives to provide targeted funding for earlycareer women scientists (including in Indigenous communities) to address gender discrimination and sexual harassment at work, strengthen worknlife balance and manage implicit bias to accessing funding. Current recipients are the Organization for Women in Science for the Developing World, the National Council of Science and Technology in Mexico and the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences.  
Data and transparency
Building the capacity of developing countries to provide high-quality, reliable data is essential for monitoring SDG implementation and is a UN High-Level Panel recommendation for a \0xECdata revolution to monitor SDG progress.
Through IDRC, Canada supports the 
Harnessing Big Data for Sustainable Development Network of institutions in Africa, Asia and Latin America, policymakers and private-sector telecom companies. The Network aims to apply big data to development innovations by strengthening researcher capacities and augmenting existing capacities while considering issues such as ethics, privacy, rights and competition.
Of 230 SDG indicators, 67 are mosteffectively measured with data derived from well-functioning civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) systems. However, when births are not officially recorded, many of the most marginalized are unable to access the services they need and exercise their legal rights. Canadais Centre of Excellence for CRVS Systems, hosted by IDRC, is a global hub that supports countries to strengthen their national CRVS systems to allow all citizens to be counted and legally recognized.
National statistics are central to reporting on SDGs. Since 2015, Canadais national statistics agency, Statistics Canada, has been playing a key role both domestically and internationally with regard to the SDGs. Internationally, Canadais active membership on the Inter-
Agency and Expert Group on SDG 
Indicators, which developed the 
Global Indicator Framework for the SDGs, is important for ensuring 
SDG reporting is statistically robust. Ongoing development of statistical methods for new indicators and refinement of existing indicators will ensure meaningful measures continue to be developed. 
Assembly of First Nations  
Indigenous peoples have practiced sustainable development on our lands for millennia. However, neither the Assembly of First Nations (AFN) nor individual First Nations in Canada had significant influence over, or involvement with, the development of the SDGs and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. As a result, the goals identified, while laudable, may not adequately reflect Indigenous perspectives on what sustainable development means or how best to measure progress.
With that caveat, the AFN has begun conversations with Indigenous Services Canada concerning the development of indicators under the SDGs that may pertain to First Nations, as well as possible means and methods for collecting and disseminating that information. It will be necessary to validate this approach with First Nations.
These conversations have begun under the auspices of a dialogue on a new fiscal relationship between First Nations governments and the Government of Canada. The focus has not been limited to any one of the 17 SDGs, as they all may be relevant. Work, thus far, has focused on the development of possible indicators for the SDGs within an outcome-based measurement and reporting framework. This is an element in developing mutual accountability between First Nations governments and the Government by which both parties share responsibility for the achievement of progress in reducing inequality between First Nations citizens and other citizens of Canada. 
The AFN and member First Nations may be interested in participating in other ways in Agenda 2030, as their interests extend well beyond the development of indicators. To date, dialogue with Canada on this subject has been limited.
Domestically, Statistics Canada remains at the forefront of Canadais strategy on the SDGs. The Agency is taking a proactive approach to Canadais global and national reporting by exploring new ways to work with traditional and nontraditional partners; examining new sources of data; and developing innovative ways to meet data usersi needs.
In September 2017, The Daily, Statistics Canadais official release bulletin, began including SDG tags. The tags are being used to identify products and publications that can be directly linked to SDG indicators. This includes products that will be used to provide data for Canada in global SDG reporting.
In an era of rapid change and increasing mistrust in institutions, open data is an important mechanism to enhance transparency, shift sociocultural norms and ensure evidencebased dialogue and collaboration between governments and civil society. Between 2015 and 2017, the Government of Canada invested $9.6 million, through the multi-donor 
Open Data for Development, in 50 organizations globally to support open data-related policies, standards, datasets and research for realizing positive development outcomes.
As co-chair of the Open Government Partnership (OGP), Canada advances gender equality through the new Feminist Open Government Initiative, which seeks to build more evidence on how technology-enabled open government with a feminist lens can lead to better governance. The Initiative aims to understand and redesign open government processes, e.g. procurement, participatory budgeting and open data focusing on femicide. It will drive genderaware OGP National Action Plan commitments and ensure processes and outcomes are inclusive.

Conclusion 
Canada is committed to implementing the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs at home, and to working with our international partners to achieve them around the world.
Although Canada is a prosperous nation, we have our challenges and more work to do to achieve the SDGs. Canadais first Voluntary National 
Review is a starting point, not an end. It provides us with a stock take of current actions, and charts the path for further action in Canada.
Like many other countries, Canada is confronted with rapid globalization, shifting demographics and the emergence of new technologies that are changing the way we live and work. In this context, wealth exists alongside poverty and vulnerability, and in between those two extremes, people in the middle-class face uncertainty for themselves and for their families.  
The 2030 Agenda is a bold and ambitious agenda that speaks to our shared hopes as we embrace the future. Canadais priorities align with this agenda and we are committed to advancing the SDGs both at home and abroad.  
Canada is working to better the lives of our citizens. We are listening to our people, so that we can put forward policies that meet their needs. We are putting people at the heart of everything we do. We are taking a whole-of-society approach and working with our partners. 
Canada recognizes the crucial importance of partnerships to achieve the SDGs. We know that by working together and sharing our diverse experiences, we are more likely to find solutions to our common problems.
All Canadians have a role to play in helping to achieve these global goals. We must work together to address the challenges we face collectively in new ways. Provincial and territorial governments have exclusive or shared jurisdiction in several policy areas that directly affect sustainable development. Many organizations across the country and around the world are already taking action on the SDGs. 
As demonstrated in the report, while great work is being done by various actors, more work needs to be done to coordinate our efforts. As noted, over the coming months the Government of Canada will be reaching out to Canadians\0xF3including provincial, territorial and municipal governments, Indigenous peoples, civil society and the private sector\0xF3 to develop a National Strategy that will catalyze action on the SDGs across the country. This work will be led by an SDG Unit housed within the Department of Employment and Social Development Canada. The SDG Unit will also support the monitoring and reporting of Canadais domestic and international efforts to achieve the SDGs by 2030. 
Federal departments and agencies have been tasked to further examine how to integrate the SDGs into their respective policies, programs and communications initiatives. Federal departments and agencies are looking at how their policies and programs are contributing to the 2030 Agendais goals and targets, with a view to identifying gaps and areas where accelerated action is needed.  
Reliable, timely, disaggregated data is vital for measuring progress on the SDGs. Canadais national statistical agency, Statistics Canada, will continue to work with the United Nations and partners on the global SDG indicator framework to help Canada and the world better measure progress toward sustainable development. Through its Sustainable Development Goals Data Hub, Statistics Canada is continuing to examine data sources that may be useful for reporting on the SDGs.
Canada will also define its own national indicators as required to ensure that we can track and report our own progress on the SDGs. Consultations on the development of a national strategy will help inform the selection of appropriate national indicators to complement the global SDG indicators.
At the international level, through its over-arching feminist foreign policy and the actions pursued as a result of the Feminist International Assistance Policy and progressive trade agreements, Canada will seek to support transformative change to eradicate poverty and leave no one behind. 
Canada will continue to do its part to advance the SDGs and build a more peaceful, more inclusive and more prosperous world.
