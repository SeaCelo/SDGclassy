
 Introduction
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2030 Agenda) is an important guiding framework for Switzerland. The Federal Council has set out corresponding political priorities in its Sustainable Development Strategy for the 2015-2019 legislative period. The objectives set out in the Dispatch on Switzerlandis International Cooperation 2017-2020 are also based on the 2030 Agenda.
In Switzerland, sustainable development is an objective enshrined in the Federal Constitution. It encompasses promoting prosperity for all, social cohesion and cultural diversity as well as the long-term conservation of natural resources and a peaceful and just international order. Government bodies at all levels have the task of seeking a durable and balanced relationship between natureis capacity to regenerate and the demands placed on it.
Key elements of Switzerlandis global responsibility in the field of sustainable development are firmly established in its constitutional foreign policy objectives: The Swiss Confederation contributes to the alleviation of need and poverty in the world, and promotes respect for human rights and democracy, the peaceful coexistence of peoples as well as the conservation of natural resources. The cantons, cities and communes, as well as the business sector, the scientific community and NGOs play a key role in the implementation of sustainable development within the country. As Switzerlandis political system is organised federally in line with the principle of subsidiarity, good coordination between all levels is essential. Many cantons have their own sustainability strategies and coordination mechanisms in place.  

2 Status of implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 
The baseline assessment which was carried out in 2017 shows that the SDGs are already well established in Swiss legislation and important sectoral policies. However, further efforts are needed to achieve them at national level and to make an appropriate contribution to their achievement at global level. 
Interested non-state actors were able to comment on the results in an open consultation process to give the report a broad-based underpinning. The \0xEB2030 Dialogue for Sustainable Developmenti platform for discussion and information exchange was launched and the 2030 Agenda Advisory Group comprising interested non-state actors was set up. 
Switzerland has already made excellent progress. It leads global rankings in important areas such as protection against natural hazards, social cohesion, quality of life and a sustainable economy. Yet some significant challenges remain. For example, Switzerlandis resource consumption n when extrapolated to the worldis population n significantly exceeds the planetis carrying capacity, and polluting processes have increasingly shifted to countries in the supply chain. One of the challenges facing Switzerland is thus to reduce the negative impact of domestic consumption on people and the environment in other countries. 
Switzerland has a system currently comprising 86 indicators to monitor the SDGs and targets of the 2030 Agenda. This system is based on internationally recognised instruments and methods developed by the Federal Statistical Office over the past 15 years.1 
Each indicator comprises three symbols. The first symbol features a white arrow on a blue background to show the targeted development measured against Switzerlandis objectives. The second indicator features a black arrow on a white background  to illustrate the observed development based on the trend (increasing, no significant change, decreasing) calculated for the period under review2 (footnote). The third symbol summarises the first two to allow an assessment of the observed development ( Positive,  Negative,  Unchanged,  No verdict).

SDG 1  
End poverty in all its forms everywhere 
Switzerland has a well-developed social security system. Nevertheless, implementation of the 2030 Agenda also calls for it to integrate the most disadvantaged people in the economy and society and grant them better opportunities, and to reduce the proportion of the population living under the national poverty line. In 2016, 7.5 per cent of Switzerlandis permanent resident population n around 615,000 people n were affected by income poverty, 140,000 of whom were gainfully employed.3

Federal Council goal: to achieve long-term poverty reduction in Switzerland.

 
Switzerlandis international cooperation assumes a multi-dimensional concept of poverty that encompasses basic human needs as well as economic, social, environmental, political and socio-cultural aspects. It places special emphasis on women and the most vulnerable sections of society and works to protect them and build their resilience. Since poverty is increasingly concentrated in countries whose governments are either unable or unwilling to ensure the basic functions of the state in the areas of security, rule of law and basic social services, Switzerland is becoming more active in these contexts. Such efforts are geared to the long term to increase their systemic effect.
SDG 2 
End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture
The Swiss agricultural sector produces about 55% of the countryis food requirements, employing approx. 150,000 people and utilising about 25% of total land area. The remaining food requirement is met through imports. No one suffers from hunger in Switzerland. Calorie production and income in the agricultural sector are largely stable. Overweight poses a problem in the overall population, and represents a significant risk factor for non-communicable diseases. This problem is being combated with public funds.
In the agricultural sector, participation in environmental and animal welfare programmes is growing, as is the percentage of organic farms (12% in 2016). Yet the long-term conservation of sustainable ecosystems and ecosystem services are still compromised by agriculture. Nitrogen pollution, loss of biodiversity and the extensive use of pesticides and antibiotics are not yet in line with the environmental objectives of the agricultural sector. The existing strategies and action plans are designed to reduce the target 

3 For definition of poverty see next footnote.
4 The absolute (as opposed to the relative) poverty threshold is defined as follows in Switzerland: falling below a specified subsistence level. For the measurement of absolute poverty in Switzerland, the FSO bases itself on the subsistence level, as recommended by the Conference of Cantonal Directors of Social Services (CDSS). Accordingly, persons who do not have the financial means to acquire the goods and services neces-sary for a socially integrated life are regarded as poor.
gaps for antibiotics and plant protection products. Nevertheless, agriculture will have to deal with the constant pressure on cultivated land. 
Switzerlandis agriculture and food sector is strongly integrated in global markets through free trade and WTO agreements and on a global scale is therefore also involved in the challenges of food security, climate, the environment and social justice.

Internationally, Switzerland supports a paradigm shift from short-term food aid to long-term food security and an improvement in the resilience of smallholder farmers and food systems. It is particularly committed to framework conditions in favour of sustainable agriculture and food systems. These include combating malnutrition, which is to a growing extent responsible for non-communicable diseases, including in developing countries. Switzerland promotes innovation to improve smallholder income and productivity, e.g. by securing land rights, developing innovative approaches to crop failure insurance, improving the geographical indication system, assisting with marketing and agricultural education and training, as well as developmental research in the field of plant breeding and improved cultivation methods.
SDG 3 
Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages 
In its Health 2020 strategy, the Federal Council set out the following goals for the Swiss healthcare system: maintain quality of life, increase equal opportunities, raise the quality of healthcare and improve transparency. Mandatory health insurance guarantees all Swiss residents access to medical services and products. Life expectancy in Switzerland is very high at 81.5 for men and 85.3 for women in 2016. However, according to Eurostat, in terms of the healthy life expectancy (HLE), Switzerland was below the EU average in 2015. 
In recent years, demographic developments, advancements in medical technology and growing capacities have led to a steady increase in healthcare costs, with correspondingly higher funding requirements through health insurance premiums and taxes. 
In Switzerland, a quarter of the population suffers from at least one chronic disease and almost 90% of deaths are due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Such diseases generate about 80% of Swiss healthcare costs.
By improving the health literacy of the population and through framework conditions which make it easier to adopt healthier behaviours, a high quality of life should be maintained. An integrated approach that includes veterinary medicine, agriculture and the environment in addition to human medicine is applied to ensure the long-term efficacy of antibiotics for health. A spread of the HIV epidemic among the general population was averted thanks to preventive approaches. However, challenges remain in the increase in other sexually-transmitted infections and vaccination rates for vaccine-preventable diseases. The WHOis International Health Regulations are of critical importance for combating global health risks.

International level: Geneva has a special role in international health policy since it is the seat of relevant international organisations, NGOs and many global initiatives. Moreover, Switzerland is also important as a centre for innovation and research in health. The pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medtech industries are among the most significant Swiss export sectors. Switzerland is involved in multilateral forums and/or projects with partner countries and focuses on (i) combating communicable diseases; (ii) sustainably improving access to medical products without undermining intellectual property rights; (iii) combating non-communicable diseases and promoting a health and human rights-based addiction policy; (iv) enhancing health systems; (v) improving the health of mothers, newborns and children, and strengthening sexual and reproductive health and rights.
SDG 4 
Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all 
Switzerland offers many and varied high-quality learning opportunities at all levels and in all areas. Switzerlandis education system is characterised by a high level of permeability. Dual-track vocational education and training is a successful model and is continually adapted to accommodate megatrends and requirements. 
Switzerland has significantly expanded its early intervention family support services in recent decades. Challenges include training enough specialist staff, improving the financial sustainability of childcare, setting up a national monitoring and reporting system, and early language support. 
Education for sustainable development (ESD) at all levels and in all areas promotes the personal responsibility and initiative of individuals and their ability to act as multipliers for sustainable thinking and action.

In its international cooperation work, Switzerland tirelessly advocates the right to education with the aim of promoting the development of education systems in developing countries based on the criteria of effectiveness, efficiency and equality of opportunity. Switzerland works to ensure that ESD topics are included in basic and vocational education curricula. The priorities of Switzerlandis international education efforts are: i) improving the governance of national education systems; ii) enhancing basic and vocational education, and facilitating the transition to working life; iii) increasing the quality of teaching and labour market relevance; and iv) promoting inclusion and equality of opportunity.
SDG 5 
Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls 
Gender equality, particularly in the family, in education and in the workplace, and the right to equal pay for work of equal value are enshrined in the Swiss Federal Constitution. The implementation of these principles in the workplace is governed by the Gender Equality Act. Gender equality is one of the Federal Councilis priorities. Switzerland ratified the UN Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women and regularly reports on its implementation in Switzerland. 
The federal government fosters the participation of women and men at all levels of decision-making in social, economic, political and public life, e.g. through financial support and tax-deductible childcare costs, or through projects that promote family-friendly working conditions, better compatibility of family and work, and improving the status of unpaid work. 
In Switzerland womenis median pay is 15% lower than menis. Around 40% of this difference cannot be explained by objective factors. In order to promote gender equality, in particular equal pay, the Gender Equality Act will be revised.  It is planned to introduce a regular analysis of wage equality for employers with at least 50 staff members.
Violence against women and domestic abuse are problems in Swiss society, too. Two out of three victims are women. To further reduce this violence, the Swiss Civil Code and Swiss Criminal Code were amended, and the Istanbul Convention was ratified. Specialist units to combat violence and forced marriage run public information and awareness campaigns, and a national action plan will be implemented by 2020, including a number of measures to better protect victims of human trafficking from violence.

Gender equality is one of Switzerlandis strategic goals in international cooperation. Within the framework of the competent UN commissions and multilateral development agencies, Switzerland is committed to the development of international policies and standards. It leads the respective policy dialogue with its partner countries.  
International level: Women are actively involved on the ground as actors and partners  in all Swiss projects and men are aware of the issue of equality. Switzerland systematically considers gender equality in context analysis, planning, implementation and monitoring. In the promotion of peace and human security, a gender perspective is included where appropriate. The priorities are: i) tackling gender-based violence and harmful practices (such as violence, child and early marriage, forced marriage and female genital mutilation); ii) fostering the participation of women at all levels of decision-making in economic, political and public life; iii) increasing the economic independence of women. 
SDG 6 
Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all 
Switzerland has extensive water resources. The entire population has access to drinking water. There are also efficient wastewater treatment plants that are operated according to the polluter pays principle. Under its constitutional mandate, the federal government promotes integrated watershed management. The cantons determine the appropriate minimum residual flows for each watercourse and withdrawal site. Switzerland has reduced its water withdrawal over the last ten years. 
Switzerlandis water sector faces certain challenges, however. Climate change has resulted in local water shortages in recent years. Recent scientific studies indicate that this phenomenon will intensify in the summer months in the future. At the same time, the glacier melt will continue to increase. 
Regular inspections are carried out to check drinking water contamination limits. Switzerland implements the WHO Protocol on Water and Health. Thanks to the construction of wastewater treatment plants, nitrogen and phosphorous levels in large and medium-sized watercourses have been significantly reduced. Measures have been taken to combat micropollutants, an action plan on risk reduction and the sustainable use of pesticides has been adopted and legislation on SVHCs (substances of very high concern) has been introduced. In addition, the Waters Protection Act provides for over 4,000 kilometres of watercourses to be restored in the next 80 years. Meanwhile, more than 1,000 barriers to fish migration, 100 hydropower plants that cause artificial run-off fluctuations, as well as 500 hydropower plants and other facilities that lead to bedload deficit in watercourses, are to be rehabilitated by 2030.

At global level, it supports the human right to clean drinking water and sanitation, initiatives to implement sustainable water resource management, integrated monitoring of surface water and groundwater, and increased multilateral coordination in the water sector.
The priorities of Switzerlandis international cooperation are: i) ensuring access to drinking water and sanitation for all; ii) improving water quality and preventing pollution; iii) promoting integrated water management and transboundary water cooperation; and iv) efficient and sustainable water use and protection and restoration of water ecosystems.
SDG 7 
Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all 
Switzerland currently has a secure energy supply. Domestic production in 2016 generated 59% of electricity from renewable hydropower and 33% from nuclear power plants. The new energy legislation and the 2050 Energy Strategy aim to ensure a sufficient, broad-based, reliable, economical and clean energy supply in Switzerland. Energy efficiency is to be increased and the use of renewables expanded. Meanwhile, the use of fossil fuels, and thus carbon emissions, are to be reduced. Switzerland intends to reduce dependence on imported energy. 
The energy and CO2 legislation contains incentives, instruments and technical regulations to reduce energy consumption, increase energy efficiency and expand renewable energies. There are financial incentives for companies to replace inefficient appliances, lights and other equipment. In addition, by 2020 the initiative entitled \0xEBThe Confederation: exemplary in energyi aims to increase energy efficiency across the Federal Administration and federal-government associated businesses by 25% compared with 2006. 
In the area of mobility, the focus is on CO2 emissions targets for cars and the introduction of a CO2 target for light commercial and articulated vehicles. By agreeing targets with energy-intensive industrial and service companies, the federal government promotes more efficient use of fuel and electricity.

It provides technical assistance and investment to help developing countries produce electricity, heating and cooling in a cleaner, more efficient, more accessible and more affordable manner while bearing in mind economic sustainability. It has specific expertise in hydropower, which it can contribute at international level. Switzerland is also committed to energy efficiency at local level. It participates in the relevant international bodies that regulate cross-border grids and energy flows. The priorities of Switzerlandis international efforts in the field of energy are: i) strengthening a reliable, accessible and affordable energy supply; and ii) promoting renewable energies and energy efficiency. 
SDG 8 
Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all 
Switzerland has high productivity, low unemployment, a high quality of work and a high level of labour market participation. It is strongly integrated in the global economy. Its export economy benefits from a developed network of free trade agreements and contractually-secured access to the EU. 
The federal government pursues a competition-friendly, sectorally neutral economic policy, which aims to further open up the economy, facilitate imports, eliminate trade barriers, maintain and develop the bilateral path with the EU and reduce red tape. At the same time, it is important to preserve Switzerlandis strengths, such as its solid state budget, high level of education and high degree of legal certainty. This also includes an efficient and functioning social partnership agreement, which, with the support of the federal government and flexible solutions at sector and company level, means the labour market can rapidly adapt to changes. 
The digital revolution presents the Swiss economy with opportunities. To harness these, it is important to further optimise the framework conditions so that the digital economy can develop. To maintain high labour market participation and good working conditions, the federal government is in favour of steadily enhancing the potential of the domestic workforce, including the participation rate of women. To this end, the federal government and cantons promote work-family reconciliation measures, the professional integration of young people and apprenticeship marketing. The federal government also encourages the labour market participation of older people and vulnerable groups.

At international level, Switzerlandis economic and trade policy measures within the framework of its international cooperation help reduce poverty and global threats, and promote peace and human rights. The primary goal is to contribute to sustainable and inclusive growth in developing countries and to increase their resilience in the globalised world economy. Switzerland focuses its efforts on middle income countries where the majority of the population live in extreme poverty and where economic and social development can influence whole regions. The priorities are: i) improving the economic conditions in developing countries; ii) expanding and developing the global trading system with the active participation of developing countries; and iii) improving working conditions at the global level (decent work agenda).
SDG 9 
Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialisation and foster innovation
The infrastructure in Switzerland is of high quality. The federal government, cantons and cities are implementing a number of measures to further upgrade the dense and high-quality integrated transport system and increase the efficiency of use, e.g. innovative transport management, easing peak traffic times through intermodal and use-based mobility pricing, the increased transfer of externalities to road users, the expansion of public transport especially in heavily populated areas and an increase in the proportion of slow traffic (by bicycle, on foot etc.) 
Compared with other countries, Switzerland has both competitive and inexpensive telecommunications networks, and continually invests in next generation mobile networks and infrastructure. Network expansion is primarily market driven.  
The federal government promotes cooperation between science and industry in order to safeguard the extremely high quality of education and research in Switzerland and the innovativeness of its business sector. The state supports the introduction of new technologies to the market and the launch of new start-ups on a subsidiary basis through applied research and the transfer of knowledge from universities to industry. The federal government and cantons want to support the universities in developing their IT capacity so Switzerland can maintain its position as a leading centre of innovation and research and develop this capability in a targeted way.

At international level, Switzerland works towards sustainable industrialisation in developing countries through international cooperation. It promotes a stable economic and financial environment, strengthens the private sector and financial services providers and improves the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises. Switzerland helps producers and companies to position themselves in value chains and promotes the integration of developing countries into the global economy. It also advocates appropriate and economically expedient protection of intellectual property through the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). Switzerland also supports developing countries in preparing basic infrastructure. This is primarily done by: i) promoting resource efficiency and clean technologies; ii) improving access to financial services for companies and producers; and iii) promoting access to information and communications technology and the internet. 
SDG 10 
Reduce inequality within and among countries 
Switzerland promotes prosperity for all through its growth policy, public education system and social security system. Moreover, various policies including rental and housing policy at cantonal and communal level help the poorest sections of the population. Switzerland facilitates access for people with disabilities to education and further training, public infrastructure, transport and services through its Disability Discrimination Act, and promotes their participation in public and political life. 
Initial measures have been taken to ensure equality for all people regardless of their sexual orientation, such as access to a state-approved form of partnership. The Criminal Code contains a provision against racial discrimination. Increased protection against discrimination in individual areas of life is currently under review.
The general standard of living in Switzerland is one of the highest in Europe. Disposable income inequality is in line with the European average and has shown little change overall. Wealth redistribution through progressive taxation and social transfer contributes to stability. 
Switzerland is committed to immigration insofar as it is in the countryis overall economic interest. In December 2017, 68.5% of the entire foreign population comprised people from the EU-28/EFTA states. Third-country nationals accounted for 31.5%. Workers from EU/EFTA countries receive ready access to the Swiss labour market thanks to the Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons. For all other countries, access is subject to certain conditions and restricted. Switzerland grants asylum to persons who meet the conditions for refugee status. It advocates secure migration paths and combats irregular migration. At a European level, it advocates spreading the burden fairly and supporting initial host countries. Switzerland attaches great importance to the integration of foreign nationals and supports measures to improve language, education, employability, information transfer and social integration. This is generally done through formal public institutions (especially schools) as well as through VET and in the workplace. Where special integration needs are identified, specific integration programmes provide support for language learning, occupational integration, career guidance and protection against discrimination.5

International level: As a major international financial centre, Switzerland contributes to shaping a fair global regulatory agenda. Specifically, this includes monitoring the implementation of international standards relating to financial market stability, taxes, combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and implementing these standards independently. Moreover, it has adjusted capital and liquidity requirements for banks to reinforce their financial stability and strengthen their credibility. It has also comprehensively revised its legislation on financial market infrastructures, derivatives trading and combating money laundering. In 2017, Switzerland enacted the legal basis for the international automatic exchange of information in tax matters. 
Swiss international cooperation aims to reduce poverty, discrimination, exclusion and vulnerability in the developing world. Switzerland works with international organisations towards a global framework for secure, orderly and regular migration and a global framework for refugees. It also aims to integrate its international cooperation with its migration policy, in order to achieve greater political coherence, have a systemic approach to the opportunities and challenges of migration and safeguard Switzerlandis interests. In this context, Switzerland focuses its efforts on peace and good governance

Some three-quarters of the Swiss population live in cities and agglomerations, which is where over 80% of jobs and 84% of economic output are concentrated. Population development and growing demand for space for living, business, transport and leisure increase the pressure on the countryside, cultural heritage, land, agricultural areas and biodiversity. The air quality has generally improved in recent years. However, pollutants and noise emissions still cause health problems in some areas. Households are connected to an advanced basic supply network. There are no severely impoverished areas, green and open spaces are generally easily accessible and there is a high level of security. 
The public and private transport system is well developed, although it is stretched to the limit on frequently travelled routes at peak times. Transport security is extremely high. However, under the Disability Discrimination Act universal access to public transport should meet the requirements of travellers with disabilities and age-related limitations by the end of 2023. 
The spatial planning concept in Switzerland is conducive to cooperation between residential and economic areas and to the review of new ways to balance costs and benefits. The federal governmentis spatial planning act in conjunction with the Swiss Nature and Cultural Heritage Protection Act form the legal framework for compact settlement development to secure the cultivated land, natural space, countryside and the natural and architectural cultural heritage, while ensuring Switzerlandis attractiveness as a place to live and work at the same time. 
Risk-reduction targets and measures are outlined in the climate adjustment strategy, the strategy for natural hazards, strategy for protection of critical infrastructure, cyber strategy, the overarching risk management systems of the federal government and cantons and in planning on how to deal with disasters and emergency situations as formulated in the structure and utilisation plans.

Federal Council goal: The proportion of moderately priced accommodation available to buy or rent is maintained or increased in high-demand areas; disadvantaged sections of the population have access to affordable housing.

Switzerlandis international cooperation efforts increasingly involve urban centres with their connection to rural regions and support them in city planning and management, decentralisation processes and strengthening local democratic structures. There is particular emphasis on disaster risk reduction through integral risk management. Switzerland is particularly active in raising awareness of the close interdependencies between disaster risk reduction, climate change and development cooperation, and encouraging the stakeholders in these areas to work more closely together. As a result, the coherent implementation of the Sendai Framework, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris climate agreement is fundamental for Switzerland. Efforts concentrate on: i) the promotion of sustainable and inclusive urbanisation; and ii) disaster risk reduction, based on the Sendai Framework. 
SDG 12 
Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns 
The federal government has declared its aim to transition to a resource-saving, sustainable economy which fulfils its responsibilities along the entire value chain. It is a challenge it intends to tackle in partnership with the private sector. The federal government draws up guidelines and sets frameworks, such as the Green Economy 2013 action plan and the corresponding programme of measures that was adopted in 2016, as well as the Federal Councilis 2015 Position Paper and Action Plan on Corporate Social Responsibility, the 2016 National Action Plan for the implementation of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and the 2013 Background Report on Commodities. 
The federal government is supporting the commitment of the business sector, the scientific community and NGOs by providing fundamental knowledge and tools, and by facilitating dialogue between all of the parties concerned. Technical and social innovation are also key to reducing resource use. To further promote possible approaches to the internalisation of externalities, Switzerland has introduced levies on CO2 and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), for example. These measures increase awareness among investors and businesses of the increasing scarcity of natural resources. 
Switzerland has a smoothly functioning system of waste management, which includes both the public and private sectors. The proportion of municipal waste that is recycled stood at 53% in 2016. The federal government promotes the circular economy by pursuing dialogue and encouraging direct responsibility in the various sectors concerned. It has also set quantitative targets in particularly relevant areas. 
The Federal Council expects companies headquartered in Switzerland to fulfil their human rights and environmental responsibilities in all of their activities. The correspond principles and activities are set out in the CSR Position Paper and the Action Plan on Corporate Social and Environmental Responsibility, as well as in the strategy for the implementation of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. As far as commodities are concerned, in 2013 the Federal Council approved measures to ensure more transparency about financial and production flows, and responsible corporate governance. 
On the consumption side, the federal government promotes consumer information and awareness. It also monitors and regulates markets in various sectors such as timber, chemicals and vehicles. The federal government has a role model function in terms of its own patterns of consumption. Switzerlandis Public Procurement Act is currently being revised. If the Swiss parliament passes the Federal Councilis bill, the various aspects of sustainability will be enshrined in law.

International level: Switzerlandis international efforts in relation to SDG 12 concentrate on: i) promoting the green economy by helping to develop harmonised international rules, supporting the UNis 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns, and activities within the framework of the international conventions on waste and chemicals; and ii) reducing food losses in developing countries, especially along the entire value chain, improving the capacity of smallholder farmers and supporting governments in establishing appropriate regulations.
SDG 13 
Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts 
Switzerland ratified the Paris Agreement in the autumn of 2017. Its target is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50% of their 1990 level by 2030, primarily by cutting domestic emissions. The CO2 Act principally covers fossil fuels, but also extends beyond CO2 to all other greenhouse gases which are subject to international regulation. It also accords the federal government a coordinating role in adaptation to climate change. 
The current mix of instruments to reduce domestic emissions includes a CO2 levy on fuels, emissions trading, measures to promote energy-efficiency, a technology fund, fuel importers being required to compensate domestically for the resulting emissions, industry agreements, and CO2 regulations for new cars. Switzerland exceeded its interim targets for 2015 in the building sector (-26% versus only -22%) and industry (-17% versus only -7%), but did not achieve the target of stabilising emissions from transport compared with 1990 (+4 percent versus 0%). Since the interim target for CO2 emissions from fossil fuels was also missed in 2016, the CO2 levy was increased from CHF 84 to CHF 96 per tonne of CO2 as of 1 January 2018. Greenhouse gas emissions are to be reduced by 20% compared with their 1990 level by 2020. 
The federal governmentis strategy in this regard covers action on water management, dealing with natural hazards, agriculture, forestry, energy, tourism, biodiversity management, health and spatial planning, while progress data is collected at two-year intervals. 
Also key to reducing the impact on climate change is the early and coordinated warning and alerting of natural hazards by the federal government. Systematic observation of the climate provides an important basis on which to improve capacity to adapt to climate-related risks. Here, the federal government functions as a coordinator within the Global Climate Observing System, as well as in a programme for monitoring the composition of the atmosphere as it is relevant to the climate (e.g. greenhouse gases).

International level: Global climate change jeopardises the progress that has been made in recent decades to combat poverty, and also presents an obstacle to strong economic growth in many developing countries, in particular the least developed countries. At the same time, many developing countries, and specifically emerging markets such as India and China, have enormous unused potential to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Switzerlandis international cooperation therefore concentrates on the following areas: i) helping developing countries to conserve their climates and to adapt to climate change; and ii) contributing a fair share to international climate funding. 
SDG 14 
Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development 
As a landlocked country, Switzerland may have no direct ocean or sea access, but through its links to the Mediterranean, North Sea (Atlantic), Adriatic and the Black Sea via four major rivers and use of the worldis seas and oceans via its consumption of fisheries products, the use of fish meal as a fertiliser, and the importation of fossil fuels and sand from ocean ecosystems, Switzerland not only has an interest in protecting the oceans, seas and their resources, but also a certain responsibility to do so.
To protect Swiss watercourses, Switzerland has joined forces with its neighbouring countries to press for reductions in pollution from nitrogen and microcontaminants. This work takes the form of measures to control air pollution, in agriculture, and to prevent water pollution, for example, through state subsidies to reduce pesticide use or measures to reduce nitrogen emissions. 
To put an end to overfishing, Switzerland takes the same measures as the EU to ensure that no illegal fisheries products enter the Swiss market.

At international level, Switzerland promotes the conservation and sustainable use of oceans, seas and marine resources by supporting international conventions and UN organisations in their efforts to prevent marine pollution. It has also ratified a large number of international covenants protecting marine and coastal ecosystems, and plays an active part in these covenantsi international organisations and bodies. The principal areas of focus are: i) protecting and sustainably managing coastal regions, marine areas and marine biodiversity; ii) participating in polar and climate research; and iii) monitoring international shipping under the Swiss flag. 
SDG 15 
Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss
Switzerland preserves biodiversity primarily by ensuring habitat protection, a task for which the cantons are responsible. A limited number of endangered species also benefit from federal and cantonal recovery programmes. These include measures to revitalise watercourses and prevent soil erosion and depletion. 
In agriculture, the setting aside of specific areas to encourage biodiversity is encouraged by means of direct subsidies. Switzerland has also defined the principal strands of its policy on biodiversity in forestry. Despite the many measures that are in place, biodiversity in Switzerland is still on the decline. Switzerland has defined measures and a timeline to create a functional ecological infrastructure. Through its biosphere reserves, Switzerland is implementing solutions which aim to reconcile biodiversity conservation with its sustainable use.
Although various measures have helped to halt the rise in certain soil impacts, and certain impacts have even declined, the economical and appropriate use of soil in Switzerland remains a considerable challenge. A national soil strategy is currently being drafted. The principal objectives of the national forest policy are to ensure sustainable, efficient and innovative forest management, an increase in the use of domestic timber, conserving forest area in its current geographical distribution, achieving economic improvement in the forestry sector, and consistently protecting the forests against the threats of harmful organisms and high nitrogen levels.

At international level, Switzerland participates in a large number of international conventions; it has ratified all seven of those conventions which are key to protecting biodiversity, and also supports their secretariats. Switzerland also assists with the drafting and implementation of national biodiversity strategies in developing countries. 
Switzerlandis principal areas of focus are: i) protecting and making sustainable use of genetic resources; ii) mobilising resources to protect the environment; iii) containing soil loss and desertification; iv) conserving and making sustainable use of forests; and v) preventing the illegal trade in plants and animals.
SDG 16 
Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels
The political system in Switzerland is characterised by decentralised power based on direct democracy, federalism and a \0xEBmilitia systemi according to which most Swiss politicians work part-time and are remunerated accordingly. Basic rights are protected by the constitution. The right of action and right of appeal ensure access to justice at all federal levels. For example, under international conventions, individual human rights appeals can be lodged with the European Court of Human Rights and with the UN Committee Against Torture, Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, and Committee on the Rights of the Child.
Corruption exists only to a very limited extent in Switzerland. In the 2017 Corruption Perceptions Index it was placed at number three, out of 180 countries. Public confidence in institutions and politicians is high.
Switzerland uses a mix of prevention, prosecution and victim support to protect its population against violence in public places, against domestic violence, and against human trafficking and smuggling. The prosecution of sexual offences against children, and of illegal pornography, as well as measures to combat human trafficking and smuggling, are coordinated nationwide. To combat violent extremism, Switzerland has adopted a national action plan to prevent and combat radicalisation and violent extremism, and is in the process of drafting a Federal Act on Police Counter-terrorism Measures. 
Switzerland has a keen interest in the integrity of its financial centre. It recognises unfair and unlawful flows of funds as a challenge that can be tackled successfully only in association with their countries of origin and destination. Switzerland applies international standards on combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism, on the exchange of information on tax matters, on tax avoidance and switching, and on fighting corruption.
Switzerland produces regular reports on its domestic human rights situation, as well as on the implementation of the UN and Council of Europe conventions on protecting human rights. It has also been the subject of a number of individual human rights-related appeal proceedings. The country abides by the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights, as well as by the findings of the various UN treaty bodies established to protect human rights. The latter are not legally binding.
