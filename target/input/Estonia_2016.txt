EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The Estonian national voluntary review on implementation of the Agenda 2030 gives information on the progress and status of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Estonia. It describes the main measures and plans for implementation of 17 Sustainable Development Goals by government and non-government organizations. The report also presents an overview of the Estonian institutional framework for the coordination of sustainable development issues including the integration of three dimensions of sustainable development, incorporation of the SDGs in national frameworks and creating ownership. A preliminary gap analysis of governments’ policies and SDGs was initiated in spring 2016. This was used as a relevant input for the review.  
The review was compiled in cooperation with several ministries and the Estonian Sustainable Development Commission. Estonian review generally follows the common reporting guidelines for Voluntary National Reviews at the HLPF, as presented in the annex of the Secretary-General’s report on critical milestones towards coherent, efficient and inclusive follow-up and review at the global level1.   
Strategic framework 
Estonia has considerable experience in advancing sustainable development. The Sustainable Development Act was adopted by Parliament already in 1995. In 2005, the Parliament adopted the Estonian Sustainable Development Strategy „Sustainable Estonia 21“2, which states 4 main goals for sustainable development in Estonia: 1) Viability of Estonian cultural space; 2) Growth of welfare; 3) Coherent society; 4) Ecological balance. The Estonian national sustainable development strategy is implemented by governments’ sectoral and thematic strategies and action plans. The national sustainable development strategy is one of the main horizontal strategies that has to be taken into account when designing governments’ strategic development plans.  
Monitoring mechanism 
The implementation of Sustainable Development Goals is monitored through an agreed set of sustainable development indicators. The set of indicators is renewed on a regular basis and covers all relevant sustainable development related topics. The current set of indicators was agreed upon in cooperation with the Sustainable Development Commission, inter-ministerial sustainable development working group and the statistical Office and Government Office. The last indicatorbased report on Estonian sustainable development was published in March 2015.3  
Institutional framework 
The Estonian coordination mechanism for sustainable development issues involves government institutions and non-government organizations from all relevant sustainable development spheres. At the central government level, the implementation and monitoring of sustainable development issues is coordinated by the Government Office Strategy Unit, which also coordinates Estonian competitiveness strategy Estonia 2020 and drafts and monitors the Government Action Plan. This helps to maintain the coherence between main horizontal strategies. Estonia also plans to utilize the functioning national coordination mechanism for sustainable development issues in coordinating the implementation of Agenda 2030.  
The Estonian Sustainable Development Commission was formed in 1996. It consists of nongovernmental roof-organizations which cover different fields of sustainable development (for example education, environmental protection, culture, children, health, local government, academy, companies, agriculture, etc). The Commission meets 4-5 times per year to hold thematic discussions on different sustainable development topics, discuss drafts of sustainable development related strategic action plans before they are adopted by the government and publish focus reports with policy recommendations.   
Coordination and monitoring also involves the inter-ministerial working group on sustainable development, which is comprised of representatives from all the ministries and the Statistics Estonia. The SD working group works on an ad hoc basis. For example, the working group has participated in compiling the set of sustainable development indicators, drafting Estonian positions for SDG negotiations, and compiling the Estonian review on Agenda 2030 implementation for the 2016 HLPF.  
Next steps for the implementation of the Agenda 2030  
The first actions connected to the Agenda 2030 were initiated during the compiling process of the national voluntary review. The preliminary gap analysis of governments’ policies and SDGs has been conducted, and its results were used as input for the review.  
The Estonian Sustainable Development Commission has launched a review of the Estonian National sustainable development strategy “Sustainable Estonia21” in the light of Agenda2030 and global trends. The analysis will be completed in fall 2016. It will give recommendations regarding the renewal of the national sustainable development strategy and its implementation mechanisms.  
Estonian Statistics Office has conducted an initial overview of 231 global sustainable development indicators and approximately 14% of the indicators are measurable right now. The renewal of sustainable development indicators will be started in 2016. The aim is to include indicators that help to measure achievements in the fields of SDG-s. It will allow the next indicator-based reports on sustainable development to provide information about performance regarding Estonian sustainable development goals and global SDG-s. A new list of indicators will be composed in cooperation with an inter-ministerial working group, the Estonian Statistics Office and the Estonian Sustainable Development Commission. 
Estonia will continue attaching great importance to the development of innovative technological solutions that help implement the SDGs. As lessons learnt, the promotion of digital technology and e-governance solutions has contributed to Estonia´s development in several areas including economic growth and human development. 
It is also important to find effective ways to raise general awareness of the Agenda 2030 and to continue contributing to the implementation of the SDG-s via international cooperation.   
 
Status of implementation of global SDG-s – initial results and main challenges  
The gap analysis of Estonian governments’ policies and SDG-s, and mapping of policy measures showed that the Estonian government and non-government sector are already implementing measures and taking actions (including via international organization) in the fields of all 17 Sustainable Development Goals. Gap analysis identified only few targets that are not covered by actions (for example combating desertification and protecting ecosystems in mountains).  
The mapping exercise indicated the areas where Estonia has achieved positive results. Estonia’s strengths include its rich biodiversity protections, high share of renewables in the heating sector, inclusive regulatory process of the government, quick and extensive access to public services through e-services and high quality and good accessibility of education.  
However, the review also highlights areas where the Estonian government needs continued efforts toward contribution to the implementation of SDG-s and Estonia’s own targets. The main challenges include achieving productivity growth, developing an energy- and resource efficient economy, lowering CO2 emissions per capita, an improvement in the subsistence of low income people and tackling the gender pay gap.  
Raising the general awareness of Agenda 2030 and creating ownership of SDG-s also need further attention in Estonia. The first conference introducing Agenda 2030 to the wider public was organized already in November 2015, where the Minister of the Environment, Minister for Foreign Affairs and other high-level officials, representatives from companies and civil society gave a general explanation of global Sustainable Development Goals as well as possibilities for implementing these goals using the example of SDG 12 – sustainable production and consumption. Innovative and comprehensive solutions are needed for creating awareness and increasing actions for sustainable development.  
Support for other countries  
The new Strategy for Estonian Development Cooperation and Humanitarian Aid 2016–20204 is based on general international development agreements and goals, e.g. the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Addis Ababa Action Agenda, as well as the development policy decisions and guidelines of the European Union (EU). The priorities of Estonian development cooperation are: 1) supporting the quality of education, 2) supporting the development of health care, 3) guaranteeing peace and stability, 4) supporting the development of democracy, introduction of good governance practices and guaranteeing human rights, 5) promoting economic development, 6) fostering environmentally friendly development, 7) raising awareness in the Estonian public, particularly younger generations, concerning development cooperation and humanitarian aid, as well as global development problems.  
Estonia promotes greater application of information and communication (ITC) technologies to the framework of development cooperation in all areas. Estonian experience in digital development, especially in e-governance and respective public-private partnerships has taught valuable lessons that Estonia is ready to share.   
1. INTRODUCTION 
 
On 25 September 2015, global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Agenda 2030 were adopted at the UN Summit. The main goal of the declaration Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which was adopted by the heads of state and government, is to eradicate poverty and to guarantee dignity and good quality of life for all, taking into consideration the resources of our planet. Agenda 2030 spells out 17 Sustainable Development Goals across 169 targets and the guidelines for completing them. The goals cover topics such as human well-being, economic growth, employment, innovation, social protection, environmental protection, energy, climate change, international cooperation, etc.  
Agenda 2030 for sustainable development is universal. This means it applies for all member states (both developed countries as well as developing countries), and governments as well as other stakeholders (companies, universities, NGOs) must contribute to the implementation of the agenda.  
In order to track fulfilment of the 2030 Agenda goals, the declaration has provided reporting and reviewing mechanisms on three levels - global, regional and national. The purpose of the reviews is to track implementation of the universal goals and targets, including the means of implementation, taking into consideration the integrated and interrelated nature of the goals and the three dimensions of sustainable development. Reporting on a national level is voluntary. Estonia has supported the idea that each country provides a review on the implementation of Agenda 2030 at least twice during the Agenda timeframe. In 2016, 22 countries, including Estonia, will provide reviews to the UN High Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development5.  
Estonia has long-term experience in sustainable development. In 1995, the Estonian Parliament adopted the Sustainable Development Act, which set the basis for sustainable development in the country and provided the prerequisites for planning it. In 2005, the Parliament adopted the Estonian Strategy for Sustainable Development: Sustainable Estonia 216, which set four main of sustainable development goals: viability of the Estonian cultural space, growth of welfare, coherent society and ecological balance. There is no separate implementation plan for Estonia's national sustainable development strategy; it is implemented via various sectoral strategies and development plans. The national sustainable development strategy is one of the principal strategy documents and must be taken into consideration, when drawing up governmental strategic development documents.  
In order to monitor the implementation of the SDGs in Estonia, the relevant Ministries, Statistics Office and relevant interest groups have agreed on the indicators of sustainable development. Based on these indicators, reports7 are prepared on a regular basis, providing information about the state of reaching these goals and the main measures for fulfilling them.  
In general, the same mechanism will be used for the implementation of Agenda 2030. For that we need to evaluate, in the light of the universal Sustainable Development Goals, which measures and implementation mechanisms are working and which ones need to be improved or added. Therefore,  Commission for Sustainable Development has initiated a review of Estonia's sustainable development strategy within the context of Agenda 2030. Additionally, the Government Office, in co-operation with the Inter- ministerial Sustainable Development Working Group, has initiated a compliance analysis related to the global sustainable-development goals. In co-operation with Statistics Estonia the renewal of Estonian sustainable development indicators will be undertaken so that they reflect Estonia's challenges in fulfilling the 17 global Sustainable Development Goals.  
The present review provides an overview of the initial results of the compliance analysis and of the initiatives for implementing Agenda 2030. The purpose of the review is to highlight the challenges, where increased efforts are needed, as well as to share positive examples regarding Sustainable Development Goals. The review gives information about relevant institutional framework, the coordination and monitoring mechanisms and the general situation according to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals including the main measures of implementation.

In compiling our review, the guidelines included in the report of the UN Secretary General were taken into account. Most of the chapters included in the recommended structure have been covered (except thematic analysis), however some chapters have been merged. For example, the topics of integration and creating ownership have been consolidated into a single chapter with institutional frameworks. The main measures of implementation and statistics based on the indicators are presented according to the goals and not in separate chapters.  
The review is based on Estonia's experiences in the implementation of Sustainable Development, 
Sustainable Development Goals and highlights the intentions related to the implementation of Agenda 2030. The purpose of the review is to map good practices to be used in the implementation of Agenda 2030 and to highlight the challenges demanding further effort.  
First the review provides an overview of the institutional framework and integration of issues relating to sustainable development, including possibilities for creating ownership. This will be followed by an overview of the present situation, and actions taken, within the framework of the 17 global Sustainable Development Goals.  
For each of the 17 goals, indicators based on statistical information and main measures implemented by the government and non-governmental sector are presented. The review provides indicators from the list of those pertaining to Estonia's sustainable development and, for which the Government has set target levels in various strategic planning documents. For example, in the Government Action Plan 2015-2019 and the State Budget Strategy 2017-2020 and Estonia's Competitiveness Agenda ‘Estonia 2020’. The indicators have been presented as a table and each is accompanied by a reference to the strategy document setting the target level.  
In mapping out the most important policy measures of the Government, the compliance analysis on the governmental policies and Agenda 2030 initiated by the Government Office has been used. An intra-ministerial sustainable development working group, including a representative of Statistics Estonia, took part in drawing up this analysis. The comparative analysis mapped out the goals and main measures of the Government of Estonia in the framework of the 17 goals and 169 targets. The main purpose was to identify the goals and targets where the Estonian Government has no goals or measures. First the coverage of goals and targets in the government's central planning documents - the Action Programme for 2015-2019, the State Budget Strategy 2017-2020, Estonia's competitiveness agenda in ‘Estonia 2020’ and Estonia's Strategy for Sustainable Development: Sustainable Estonia 21- were analysed. When measures regarding the targets were not found in the horizontal strategy documents, the analysis was continued on the sectoral development plans adopted by the Government. A summary on the results of the analysis is presented in the introductory part of Chapter 6.  
The information about the activities of the non-governmental organisations was provided by Estonia's Commission for Sustainable Development, which is made up of various umbrella organisations dealing with issues of sustainable development (educational institutions, nature conservation agencies, child protection services, businesses, the energy sector, heritage protection groups, youth organisations, local governments, etc.). The Commission for Sustainable Development mapped out the actions of its member organisations in the light of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and gave examples of actions taken by other organisations. The most important examples have been outlined in the review in connection with the goals.  
The compilation of the review was co-ordinated by the Government Office. The review has been discussed and ratified by the Sustainable Development Working Group as well as Estonia's Commission for Sustainable Development. In addition, the preliminary results have been discussed with the representatives of the Finnish Commission for Sustainable Development during the meeting of the Finnish and Estonian Sustainable Development Commissions in Tallinn on 3 June 2016.  
 	 

3. THE INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK  
 
Estonia's coordination mechanism for sustainable development issues is comprised of ministries as well as non-governmental organisations (NGOs) from every significant field of sustainable development. The coordination system comprises the Intra-Ministerial Sustainable Development Working Group as well as Estonia's Commission for Sustainable Development, which is composed of NGOs. For the central government, sustainable development issues and their institutional framework are co-ordinated by the Government Office7. The same mechanism will be used for coordination of the implementation of Agenda 2030.  
Estonia's Commission for Sustainable Development was created as an advisory commission to the Government in 1996. The Commission connects non-governmental umbrella organisations in different areas of sustainable development - environmental protection, entrepreneurship, the academic sector, heritage protection, child protection, youth organisations, the energy sector, etc. This spring, a decision was reached to review the membership of the Commission for Sustainable Development in order to have all the important issues related to sustainable global development goals covered. Up until now, representatives of development co-operation groups were not included in the work of the Commission.

The Commission for Sustainable Development meets regularly 4-5 times a year. In addition to the sessions there are discussions on various topics initiated by the members of the Commission. Representatives of the Ministries as well as experts take part in the discussions. The most significant strategy documents related to sustainable development are presented to the Commission prior to their adoption. The Commission releases analysis-based issue-focused reports, together with policy recommendations. In the past few years the Commission has put out reports focusing on the following topics: human resources (2010), transport (2010), domestic energy conservation (2012), the potential of green work places (2012), the protection status of privately-owned heritage objects (2014), the attitudes and behaviour of Estonian men: issues related to health, education, employment, living and working abroad, and creating family (2015). In the next issue-focused report the timeliness and relevance of Estonia's sustainable development strategy Sustainable Estonia 21 will be analysed in the light of new development trends and Agenda 2030.  
The intra-ministerial Sustainable Development Working Group consists of the representatives of the Ministries and Statistics Estonia. The work of the working group mostly takes place via electronic communication and meetings take place based on necessity. For example, the working group was involved in formulating the Estonia's sustainable development indicators and worked on the preparation of the Estonian position for negotiating Agenda 2030. The Working Group on Sustainable Development tackles the issues on a horizontal and more general basis. Questions related to certain subject fields are discussed in relevant commissions, for example, the Commission on Science Policy, the Commission for Transport, the Council for Energy, the Commission for Gender Equality, etc.  
Figure 1. Monitoring sustainable development in Estonia 

Monitoring of the implementation of Sustainable Development Goals is accomplished through a monitoring mechanism based on the indicators of sustainable development for Estonia and through a regularly published review detailing the status of the sustainable development indicators, compiled by Statistics Estonia in co-operation with the Government Office and various ministries. The last review was published in 20158. The list of indicators being monitored has been agreed upon in co-operation between the Estonian Commission for Sustainable Development, the Intra-Ministerial Sustainable Development Working Group and the Government Office and Statistics Estonia. The list of indicators of sustainable development mainly consists of those indicators already being monitored in various agendas, and are deemed valid by the observations of different interest groups. So far the compilation of the indicators of sustainable development has been focused on implementation of the main goals of Estonia's Sustainable Development Strategy (viability of the Estonian cultural space, growth of welfare, social coherence and ecological balance). In 2016 the list of indicators for sustainable development in Estonia will be updated in order to reflect important indicators connected to the implementation of the global Sustainable Development Goals.  
According to Statistics Estonia, out of 231 indicators which have been developed for the monitoring of Agenda 2030, 32 are currently measurable in Estonia. Gathering information on the rest of the indicators needs extra work and is a challenge for the statistics system.  
 	 

4. INTEGRATION OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT ISSUES 
 
The integration of Sustainable Development Goals and topics into various thematic development plans is guaranteed in Estonia via the strategic planning system. The Government’s regulations on compiling strategic development plans require that when drawing up various development plans, Sustainable Development Goals must be taken into account. There is no separate implementation plan for Estonia's sustainable development strategy. Reaching the goals is achieved via various thematic development strategies and their implementation plans. Such a system of strategic planning guarantees that the compiled development plans support the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals. 
Impact assessment methodology accepted by the Government guarantees that the environmental, economic and social aspects shall be taken into account while drawing up the main strategic planning documents. According to this methodology, while preparing legal acts, creating development plans and approving the Government’s positions on EU matters, the impact on various fields has to be assessed. These are: 1) social impact, including demographic impact; 2) impact on security and foreign policy; 3) impact on the economy; 4) impact on the living and natural environment; 5) impact on regional development; 6) impact on the organisation of government institutions and local governments. In addition, in accordance with the Environmental Impact Assessment Act, when compiling strategic planning documents and local plans a strategic environmental impact assessment has to be conducted. Environment in this context has a broader meaning than just the natural environment. It means that impact on natural, social, economic and cultural environment should be assessed. 
Also the Code of Good Engagement adopted by the Government states that government institutions must involve interest groups and the general public when making decisions affecting them. The most important decisions and drafts will be put up for public consultation. This way, the representatives of various interest groups can provide their opinions and draw attention to important aspects of the topics pertaining to their respective fields.  
The coordination mechanism of sustainable development itself is helping to integrate the topics of sustainable development. The Strategy Unit of the Government Office is coordinating the work of both the sustainable development working group as well as the Commission for Sustainable Development. In addition to matters related to sustainable development, the Government Office also coordinates the composition and monitoring of the Government of Estonia's action programme and Estonia's Agenda for Competitiveness: Estonia 2020. In addition, Estonia's EU policy and security policy are co-ordinated by the Government Office. This helps to guarantee the integration of matters related to sustainable development in various horizontal planning documents.  
 	 
5. INCORPORATION OF THE SUSTAINABLE 
DEVELOPMENT GOALS INTO NATIONAL POLICIES AND CREATING OWNERSHIP  
 
In 2005, the Estonian Parliament adopted the Estonian Strategy for Sustainable Development Sustainable Estonia 21, which sets the sustainable development goals for Estonia. According to the strategy, the four main goals of sustainable development in Estonia are: viability of the Estonian cultural space, growth of welfare, coherent society and ecological balance. In order to assess the timing and relevance of Estonia's sustainable development strategy Sustainable Estonia 21 in the context of fulfilling the purposes of Agenda 2030 the Commission for Sustainable Development has initiated an assessment of the strategy. The analysis will be ready in autumn 2016 and as a result, proposals regarding updating the strategy or improving its implementation shall be made. In the proposals the most suitable implementation mechanisms for Agenda 2030 will be taken into consideration.  
An analysis of the goals of Agenda 2030 as well as government policies proved that the Government's goals and actions are already addressing most matters related to global Sustainable Development Goals. Also a large number of the goals brought out in the government action plan coincide with the goals and targets of Agenda 2030. In order to underline the challenges related to the global Sustainable Development Goals, indicators characterising the implementation of Agenda 2030 should be added to the monitoring system of Estonia's Sustainable Development Goals. In fall 2016 the list of indicators for Estonia's sustainable development will be updated in order to reflect important indicators included in the implementation of the global Sustainable Development Goals. Hence, it will be possible to assess the progress in implementing Agenda 2030 based on the future indicator-based monitoring reports and to highlight the challenges, where increased efforts are needed.  
In the case of Estonia, the challenge is to increase awareness and ownership regarding the 
Sustainable Development Goals. Organisations participating in the work of the Commission for Sustainable Development, as well as the officials taking part in the work of the Sustainable Development Working Group, are aware of the matters related to sustainable development but it is important to increase awareness on a larger scale. This can be done via different events related to sustainable development, by providing information materials and educating students on matters related to sustainable development. For example, a seminar dedicated to the universal Sustainable Development Goals was organised in autumn 2015, where in addition to introducing the goals in general the example of Goal 12, was used to show what it means to implement Agenda 2030. The Sustainable Development Forum taking place in autumn 2016 will also be introducing the global Sustainable Development Goals and will more specifically deal with matters related to food waste. In addition, the NGO Mondo initiated the publication of a special edition dedicated to Agenda 2030 and Sustainable Development Goals, which was published as a supplement to national newspapers. Awareness and ownership can also be increased via participating in the  EU Sustainable Development Week (www.esdw.eu), which took place for the second time this year and was dedicated to the global Sustainable Development Goals.  
A 7-year educational programme on sustainable development organised by the Environmental Board and financed from the EU Structural Funds, has helped to increase the awareness on matters related to sustainable development. During the course of the programme various seminars were organised for teachers in academic and vocational schools, university professors and educational specialists in NGOs. In addition, teaching materials were compiled. In spring 2015 a high-level conference on sustainable development education took place in Tallinn in the framework of the programme. 
Awareness can be increased by discussing the various goals of Agenda 2030 in different regional and international organisations and working groups, e.g. the OECD, the EU, and the Baltic Sea Council.  
Local municipalities apply the main principles of sustainable development through the action plans and local legislation adopted during the processes related to Agenda 21. For example, Tartu, Kuressaare, Viljandi and Pärnu have adopted the Agenda 21 action plans. In addition, the actions related to sustainable development by the local authorities are further enhanced by taking part in regional cooperation and in international local authorities' networks, e.g. in the context of the Aalborg Charter (1994) and the Aalborg Commitments (2004). At the 2015 Paris Summit the mayors and local government leaders adopted the Paris City Hall Declaration, which made a considerable contribution to the 2015 climate negotiations COP21 and which designated the role and focus of cities in the global fight against climate change. In April 2016 the 8th European Sustainable Development Conference for cities and other local authorities Actions make changes - the potential for Europe took place in Bilbao, where the Basque Declaration “New Pathways for European Cities and Towns to create productive, sustainable and resilient cities for a liveable and inclusive Europe was adopted. 
A positive example of a great initiative is the Green Capital of Europe initiative, which began in Tallinn on 15 May 2006, when 15 European Mayors or their representatives9 signed a memorandum for a proposal for the European Commission to recognize each year a city where, in addition to environmentally-friendly management decisions and an increasing general awareness of the environment issues, the principles of sustainable development have been implemented as well. By now, the European Commission has also created a similar prize system for smaller cities, called the European Green Leaf.  
 	 
6. IMPLEMENTING THE GOALS OF AGENDA 2030 IN ESTONIA  
 
In the present chapter, an overview of the goals of the Government of Estonia and its main actions in the framework of the goals of Agenda 2030 is provided. There are presented national indicators that are currently used for measuring the relevant goals together with the target levels set by the government and the present situation. In addition to the main measures and actions of the central government, examples have been given concerning the actions taken by non-governmental organisations. The overview is based on the comparative analysis done in spring 2016 on the goals of Agenda 2030 and the policies of the Estonian Government.  
In order to assess the extent to which the goals of Agenda 2030 are covered by the policies of the Estonian Government, a preliminary comparative analysis was made. First the coverage of goals and targets in the government's central planning documents - The Government's action programme for 2015-2019, the State Budget Strategy 2016-2020, Estonia's plan for competitiveness Estonia 2020 and the Estonian National Strategy for Sustainable Development Sustainable Estonia 21 were analysed. Regarding the targets which were not covered by a goal or a measure in the horizontal strategies, the comparative analysis was continued with the development plans of specific areas, e.g. the Welfare Development Plan 2016-2023, the Estonian Rural Development Plan 2014-2020, the Estonian Lifelong Learning Strategy 2013-2020, and the Strategy for Research, Development and Innovation 2014-2020.  
The Government of Estonia along with NGOs is implementing different measures and activities in each of the areas covered by the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. Estimations show that about one third of the 169 targets are covered either partly or via international cooperation. Only some targets are not addressed through actions, e.g. fighting desertification and protecting the ecosystem of mountains. The implementation of several targets takes place on the basis of international agreements or by participating in the work of international organisations or conventions, e.g. the Convention for the Protection of the Baltic Sea Environment HELCOM, the UN convention of Maritime Rights UNCLOS, the ILO "Global Jobs Pact. 
6.1 Goal 1. Eradicate poverty in all its forms everywhere 
 
Estonia's goals and the situation in general  
 
Although Estonia poverty differs from that in developing countries, the reduction of poverty and the problems accompanying it are among the priorities of the Government's action programme. The goal of the Government is to reduce the amount of absolute poverty to 5.9% by 2019. Special attention is paid to the reduction of poverty among children, and the related goal is to reduce absolute poverty among children aged 0-17 to 7% before 2019. Reducing social inequality and poverty as well as increasing gender equality and social inclusion, are the targets of the Government's Welfare Development Plan 2016-2023, which also includes resources and measures to achieve this.  
Economic difficulties and poverty are endangering mostly women, elderly people, people with disabilities and the unemployed. Also, social protection measures are not always enough to protect people from poverty. The biggest goal in this area for Estonia is to guarantee social protection in the case of job loss and unemployment; however, in many cases it is not preventing people from falling into poverty. In order to provide solutions for these challenges additional measures need to be applied for people with lower income levels in order to prevent and reduce poverty. 
Indicator Current situation Target  Absolute poverty  (EGAP, SBA) 6.3%  
(2014) 5.9%  
(2019) Level of absolute poverty among children aged 0-17 (SBA) 9.1%  
(2014)  7% (2019)  
Measures and activities 
Various measures targeted towards education, youth work, the labour market and the social sphere help to reduce poverty. It is important to increase the level of education among people with less of it, to reduce the proportion of people without vocational education and to increase the level of employment via measures for different target groups (the unemployed, the youth and the elderly, etc.). At the same time, it is important to provide the weaker social groups with effective and welltargeted social support as well as with accessible public services targeted toward personal empowerment (i.e. education, youth work) in order to decrease poverty and the risks of marginalisation. 
In Estonia, there are two measures of social protection. Social insurance is a guarantee provided by the government when in the case of certain social circumstance (e.g. death, loss of main provider, old age, work disability, birth of a child) an additional income or at least an income providing a humane living standard is made available. Social insurance is funded from obligatory contributions or taxes, as well as by voluntary payments. Welfare is a system of services designed to guarantee various personal freedoms, and through developing human resources to improve conditions for economic development. At the same time social inclusion will be increased and poverty and social exclusion will be prevented and alleviated more efficiently and on a broader scale. Both benefits and care programs are instruments (activities) of social services.  
The Government believes that the various social transfers should be on an adequate level to support the independence of people. For that the Government has decided to increase the subsistence level, which is the basis for calculating social benefits. There will also be a support scheme for pensioners living alone.  
In order to improve the subsistence of people with low-paying jobs the Government has decided to create an annual system of refunds, so that people when doing their tax returns can apply for a refund if they have been working full-time for at least 6 months and their annual income remains below a certain level. In addition, efforts will be continued in the educational sphere in order to reduce the share of people without vocational education and to raise the qualification of people with a lower educational level. It will be necessary to guarantee, within the next few years, that the services offered by the state will provide a sustainable service chain for improving the skills of the labour force, preventing unemployment and increasing productivity - and which would include the study and analysis of the needs of the labour market, the evaluation of skills, offering integrated counselling and education for the target groups considered to be a priority for the Government.  
The ability of families to cope with hardship will be significantly impacted by the increase in family benefits in effect until 2019. In addition, a support scheme for recreational activities will be initiated in order to guarantee an access to recreational activities for all children taking into consideration their socio-economic background. An important part of family policy is to guarantee a sufficient number of places in kindergartens, and therefore the creation of child care places will be funded from the EU Structural Funds in order to improve the access to childcare in regions with a lack of child care places today. 
In order to support single parents, a maintenance allowance scheme has been initiated in order to support children whose separated parents are liable for paying allowances by court order but who do not fulfil their obligations. Additional coercive measures have been imposed on parents owing support payments and the Government continues with developing further measures in order to improve the payment of allowances. 
In the framework of international development cooperation, Estonia is continuously working towards the eradication of poverty, guaranteeing human rights and environmental sustainability. For the purpose of effectiveness and sustainability in development cooperation, Estonia considers it important to follow the principle of women’s empowerment and gender equality in all its development cooperation and humanitarian aid work. In order to improve the situation of people living in poverty, Estonia believes it is important to support their development opportunities. The most sustainable and long-term investment target for increasing the opportunities of people as well as the development of society is the accessibility of quality education. 
Among the non-governmental organisations, the Estonian Roundtable for Development Cooperation is promoting Sustainable Development Goals, and the reduction of global poverty and inequality. One of the main goals of Estonia's development cooperation is the eradication of global poverty. The Estonian Roundtable for Development Cooperation informs the general public about this, and empowers and coordinates its members.  
Among the Estonian NGOs dealing with development cooperation there are organisations that empower and support the activities of small enterprises, especially female entrepreneurs, in the Eastern Partnership countries (Georgia, Moldova), as well as in Africa, Turkey and the Philippines. By teaching women the necessary skills, helping them buy the necessary equipment for production, and by charting the sales channels. Very concrete steps are taken on the local level to help people escape poverty. Also offering education and making education more accessible for those children in the developing countries for whom it would otherwise be very complicated. In the educational field the Estonian NGOs operate, for example, in Palestine, Ghana, Ethiopia. 
 
  
6.2 Goal 2. End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture  
 
Estonia's goals and the situation in general  
 
Estonia is part of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), funded from the EU’s common budget and governed by the same rules. During the years the general goals of the CAP have remained unchanged; however via several reforms the agricultural policy has become considerably more modern. In addition, measures to improve productivity, incomes of the producers, stabilisation of markets, food security and reasonable consumer price sustainability have been added.  
The goal of the Government of Estonia is to support areas in achieving viable and competitive agriculture and fisheries, guaranteeing food safety and consumer satisfaction. The Government supports the development of environmentally-friendly and ecologically-clean organic production, as well as supporting processing, marketing and developing export possibilities, and valorisation of agricultural land for more effective use of the biological resources. Regarding the productivity of the agricultural sector the Government in its action programme has set the target for a net growth of 3% per labour unit per year (compared to the previous year) in the agricultural sector and an added value of at least 21,150 euros per employee in fisheries. 
In making food production more sustainable, Estonia's challenges are finding a balance between food production, soil preservation, water and biodiversity. Environmental conservation, sustainable use of renewable natural resources, preserving nature and biodiversity in agricultural production can be guaranteed only through the implementation of organic farming and other agri-environment benefits included in the rural development plan.  
Indicator  Current situation Target  Average annual value-added net growth per labour unit 
(compared to the previous year) in the agricultural sector (SBA; EGAP) (-)7.1% (2014)  3.0  (2019) Value-added net growth per labour unit in the fishing sector  
(EGAP) 18,249 (2014) 21,150 (2019)  
Measures and activities 
 
The Estonian Government’s Action Plan, the SBA and the Rural Development Plan include several measures for developing sustainable agriculture, including increasing the awareness of agricultural producers, developing production technology, promoting competitive and resource-efficient agriculture, improving the position of food producers in the supply chain, sustainable use of the environment and optimal use of resources in the fishing sector. In addition, environment and climate change support is paid to agricultural companies. In order to guarantee the development of agricultural sustainability, innovation and knowledge transfers are promoted in the agricultural sector. Developing sustainable agriculture is done via the measures included in the Rural Development Plan.  
In organic farming, the main requirements stem from the EU legislation. They apply both in plant and livestock farming, in processing as well as marketing. Measures targeted toward improving the competitiveness of organic farming and increasing the consumption of organic foods are implemented via the Organic Farming Development Plan 2014-2020.  
Keeping and managing the genetic resources of agricultural crops is done via the Ministry of Rural Affairs programme Collecting and keeping the genetic resources of agricultural crops 2014-2020. Through this programme the genetic resources of agricultural crops are collected and the collections managed; international cooperation is promoted; managerial work is done; and organisation and awareness-raising increased. Likewise, through the programme the preservation of genetic resources for global agricultural crops and their sustainable use, and the just and impartial distribution of these benefits in the interests of sustainable agriculture and food security practices is being monitored to comply with the international agreement on sustainable agricultural and in conformity with the convention on biodiversity. 
In 2017 the Green Book on nutrition and exercise will be completed. The purpose of this document is to shape an integrated and long-term policy on preventing problems coming from unhealthy nutrition and lack of exercise. In order to foster healthy diets, information activities on food production technologies will be organised for the producers, the caterers and the people. Estonia is taking part in the EU's School Milk Scheme, the aim of which is to promote milk products and provide a balanced menu for the children.  
In the last few years the subject of food waste has received more attention. The state has commissioned studies in order to estimate the amount of food waste in different sectors, in domestic households as well as in the retail- and wholesale industries, in the food industry and the agricultural sector. A food-waste roundtable comprised of representatives of different ministries meets in order to find solutions geared to the prevention of food waste.  
In the non-governmental sector the European Aid Fund and the Estonian Food Bank, the group organising food aid distribution in Estonia and the local authorities cooperate in order to reduce hunger and prevent food waste.  
In terms of development cooperation and humanitarian aid, Estonia’s priority is to direct food aid and other humanitarian aid to saving lives during natural or man-made catastrophes or post catastrophe. 
6.3 Goal 3. Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all in all age groups  
 
Estonia's goals and the situation in general  
 
Estonia's healthcare system may be considered effective in the EU as well as the global context. More than 90% of the population is covered by health insurance, meaning that most of the population has access to healthcare services. One of the government’s priorities is to improve public health. The target of the government’s action plan is to increase healthy life years from birth to 59.2 years in the case of men, and 64.4 years in the case of women. Regarding life expectancy, the targets are 74.5 years in the case of men, and 83.6 years in the case of women. Also one of the targets of the Government is to decrease the number of fatal accidents, poisonings and trauma to 65 deaths per 100 000 people.  
The biggest goals are increasing life expectancy and life-long health, guaranteeing the sustainable financing of the health-care system, decreasing the number of new HIV cases and reducing the number of injuries and death from injuries. Also in order to prevent diseases, health related behaviour needs to be promoted and use of addictive substances decreased.

Measures and activities 
 
Developments in the field of health are mapped out in the Population Health Development Plan 
2009-2020, approved by the Government of Estonia. Effectiveness is an important factor in the Estonian healthcare system, the purpose of which is to improve the indicators of public health, improve the quality of the healthcare system and guarantee the optimal use of the resources of health insurance.  
In order to guarantee the accessibility of high-quality health services for the whole population, taking into consideration the demographic trends and sustainable use of resources the target is to network (promote cooperation between) the county hospitals with the regional hospitals. In order to improve the accessibility of primary health services, health-care centres are being created, consolidating primary health care services and their support services. 
The effectiveness of providing health-care services and the cost savings are supported by the ehealth strategy, the purpose of which is to create a well-cooperating network of primary level esolutions and services based on them by 2025. The final goal is to more effective use of the healthcare, labour market and social services systems’ resources and improve the satisfaction of the service users. As an example, the e-ambulance service is ready and in use. In the patient portal the patients are able to see their treatment bills. 
In 2015 the research, development and innovation strategy 2015-2020 of the Estonian health-care system, Putting science and innovation at the service of health-care, was completed, generating a common understanding on how research, development and innovation can more effectively support the goals of the Estonian health-care system. Among other things the development of personal medicine is targeted and a pilot project on the development of personal medicine is being prepared. 
Important political measures from the perspective of public health are described in the Green Book on Alcohol Policy and in the Green Book on Tobacco Policy. The Green Book on Nutrition and Exercise is being completed, the purpose of which is to shape an integrated and long-term policy on preventing problems stemming from unhealthy nutrition (including preventing obesity). The purpose of alcohol policy is to reduce the social, economic and health damages resulting from the abuse of alcohol, Also, to guarantee a supportive environment for the growth of children and youth, and make the living environment safer for all. Social campaigns titled Let’s drink less by half and Passive drinking have been organised. 
The target of the Green Book on Tobacco Policy is to reduce the health damage caused by tobacco and to prevent the accessibility of tobacco by minors. The aim is to decrease the number of daily smokers to 18% by 2025 and the number of smokers to 24% by 2025. 
Measures against HIV and AIDS are coordinated within the framework of the Public Health Development Plan. The target is to reach a steady downward trend in the spread of HIV, hence the following activities are being carried out: prevention activities for various target groups, HIV testing and counselling; prevention of HIV and AIDS, as well as treatment, care, monitoring and assessment; developing the related human and organisational resources.  
From the NGO sector, programs such as the Good Deed Foundation and a donation environment founded by Swedbank - I love to help - through which it is possible to support various relief organisations deserve mention. It is possible to donate to the AIDS Information and Support Centre to support the prevention of drug addiction as well as rehabilitation. In addition many different organisations operating in the health sector have been supported. 
The purpose of the Healthy Estonia Foundation is to help shape health behaviours and decrease the number of preventable deaths in Estonia. To facilitate this, health-awareness is being promoted through discussion and dialogue. 
Estonian cities have, since 1999, co-operated in order to introduce and implement the ideas and principles behind the healthy cities movement, contributing to the achievement of health and wellbeing amongst all age groups in cities and counties. In order to promote and implement the principles of healthy city living in Estonia, in 2002 13 local governments founded an NGO called the Network of Healthy Cities. Systemic implementation of the WHO healthy cities benchmarks (health indicators, health services indicators, environmental indicators, social and economic indicators) in the monitoring of local situations, and in raising the awareness of decision-makers, are important input factors for knowledge-based planning of local development.  
 
Estonians are willing to help people who are in need for health reasons. As an example, the Christmas Tunnel TV show, aired by the Estonian Public Broadcasting network, is a charity programme collecting donations for different hospitals and health organisations for the purpose of improving the quality of medical aid through the purchase of better medical equipment. 
The international student organisation AIESEC is organising a six-week project, the purpose of which is to find solutions to the problems of drug and alcohol abuse and promote healthy lifestyles in the local communities. The target group of the project is high-school students and young people aged 18-25. 
In the period 2011-2015 Estonia supported the advancement of health-care in the developing countries with almost 2.6 million EUR through its development cooperation. In the period 20162020 Estonia will continue the implementation of bilateral projects in order to improve the accessibility of health-care services and improve the competence and capacity of health-care in its partner countries. In addition Estonia will continue to co-finance healthcare projects and supporting organisations with voluntary donations in cooperation with international organisations, the WHO as well as UNICEF. 
 
6.4 Goal 4. Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all  
 
Estonia's goals and the situation in general  
 
Among the OECD countries Estonia has the best opportunities for getting an education (considering the social and economic context). Estonia has a high-quality educational system and the proportion of students in general education is high. The indicators of Estonian students in secondary education rank as some of the highest in Europe and are in constant development (OECD School resources of Estonia review). In Estonia education (including higher education) is equally accessible to men and women.  
The goal of the Government of Estonia is to create learning opportunities for all Estonian people, based on their needs and capacities, throughout their lifetimes in order to guarantee them possibilities for dignified personal fulfilment in society, at work and in family life. It is also important to guarantee internationally competitive education. For this purpose, an important priority is competent and motivated teachers and school leaders.  
In its action programme the Government has set the target of updating the organisation of basic education, putting the gymnasium network in order, and implementing curricula reform. It is also important to continue offering and widening the opportunities of lifelong learning. An important principle on all levels of education is that the education being offered answers the needs of the labour market.  
Indicator  Current situation Target Proportion of young people (18-24) with primary or lower level education discontinuing their studies  (Estonia 2020) 11.2% (2015) 9.5% 
(2020) Proportion of adults (24-64) without special or vocational education  (Estonia 2020) 29.2% (2015)  30% (2020) Percentage of adults in education  (Estonia 2020, SE indicators) 12.2% (2015)  20% (2020) Proportion of 30-34 year olds with third level education in their age group  (Estonia 2020) 45.2% (2015)  40% (2020)  
 
Measures and activities 
 
In Estonia education is accessible and free of charge for everyone, regardless of gender, religion or socio-economic background. Basic education is the compulsory minimum for general education, and it is available in primary schools (grades 1-6), secondary school (grades 1-9) or in a gymnasium which provides primary school education. According to the Primary School and Gymnasium Act the costs of schooling will be covered by the education provider, which in most cases is the local government. The state supports the education provider through funding for expenditures like salaries for teacher and school leaders, as well as for training, educational material and school meals. It is within the mandate of the local governments to establish, reorganise and close general educational schools.  
 
In the field of basic education, it is important to guarantee a place in childcare and good quality basic education for all. Three thousand new places in childcare by 2020 will be funded from the EU structural funds. In addition, changes in basic education will be implemented within the next few years, the purpose of which is to tie basic education and childcare into a unified regulated system, offering children care and education until school age, including childcare and nursery schools, irrespective of whether they are public or private.  
At the levels of basic and secondary education, the challenges are the effectiveness of the use of resources and the ability of the educational network to adapt to demographic changes. The educational network must be harmonised with the changes that have taken place, including the decrease in the number of school-aged children during the past 16 years, as well as urbanisation. In order to guarantee a uniform quality of education, educational reform will be conducted, the purpose of which is to create state gymnasiums in every county. It is important to develop the teaching profession and to make it more attractive. In order for schools to become a career option for the best and brightest, the average salary of teachers will be raised to a higher level. 
In the field of higher education the goal is to achieve internationally-competitive higher education, supporting the areas of Estonia's economic growth and the development of society, preparing specialists in the fields of growth as well as in the fields of culture and other fields necessary for the functioning of the state. Every motivated and talented candidate can have access to higher education and every teacher should have access to the labour market. The goal in higher education is that by the year 2020, 40% of people aged 30-34 will have obtained third-level education. In order to improve access to higher education the possibility of getting free higher education for every fulltime student studying in the Estonian language has been created. In addition there is a needsbased study support system for economically-disadvantaged students. In order to improve the quality of higher education, a clearer division of labour has to be established and the consolidation of fields of study between universities. 
In order to fulfil the opportunities of lifelong learning, a programme of adult education will be implemented, the purpose of which is to improve the opportunities of Estonia's adult population to participate in high-quality flexible and diverse lifelong learning, taking into account the needs of the labour market. The main targets of educational activities are the people without secondary education, vocational training and those with outdated skills. 
An NGO initiative, the Bully-free School - Let’s free Estonian schools of bullying! programme coordinates and organises programmes for the prevention of bullying in schools. The Estonian Chamber of Industry and Commerce in cooperation with other organisations has created a webbased community supporting teachers of entrepreneurship in the gymnasiums. In addition the organisation deals with the cooperation of schools and companies, trying to make the curriculum more practical and relevant. The basic idea of the NGO group, The Estonian Educational Forum, has been to analyse the big challenges in education, pooling the representatives of educational policy interest groups, for the purpose of promoting the principles of participatory democracy, partnership and social contracts in Estonian educational policy. 
The Estonian national commission at UNESCO and the NGO Mondo coordinate the Estonian network of UNESCO schools, where the affiliated schools carry out various projects, through which they introduce innovative measures and approaches in their country's educational field. The schools participating in the network are able to exchange experiences with other schools in 180 different countries and take part, for example, in video conferences and international events. The actions of the schools in the network focus on the following topics: the challenges facing the World and the role of the UN in solving them, human rights, democracy, tolerance, intercultural learning and understanding, environment and sustainable development. 
 
Estonia’s development cooperation in 2011-2015 mainly dealt with the financing of educational projects in the partner countries, including supporting training programmes and research networks and the providing of student grants. In addition, international development cooperation and humanitarian aid organisations have been supported, for example UNICEF, UNDP, UNGEI and their initiatives. In 2011-2015 more than 6 million EUR have been contributed to the educational projects. Estonia will continue financing the activities helping to develop the educational systems of the partner countries, paying special attention to the improvement of the quality of education.  
6.5 Goal 5. Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls  
 
Estonia's goals and the situation in general  
 
The gender equality act applies in Estonia with the purpose of guaranteeing equal treatment based on gender, as foreseen in the Estonian constitution and to promote the equality of men and women in all spheres of the society. In order to achieve this, the law forbids gender-based discrimination in the public as well as in the private sector and dictates that all institutions of the central and local government as well as educational and scientific institutions promote the equality of men and women. The Gender Equality and Equal Treatment Commissioner is responsible for monitoring compliance with these laws.  
Estonia uses a dual strategy in order to promote gender equality - implementing specific measures directly aimed at solving the problems related to gender inequality as well as gender mainstreaming, i.e. taking into account the gender aspect in the policies of all sectors. 
The biggest problem in gender equality is the inequality of the position of men and women in the labour market, expressed in the gender pay gap. In 2014 the difference between the hourly wage of men and women i.e. the gender pay gap, was 23.3%. The goal is to reduce the gender pay gap to 19.7% by 2020. The employment gap reflects the problem that part of the potential and qualification of women remains unused in the labour market. Considering the overall high educational level of Estonian women, which is well above the average educational level of men, society's investment in the education and training of women remains partially unused. Moreover, the lower employment rate of women increases their dependency and inequality also in the longterm perspective, i.e. during retirement age.  
Indicator Current situation Target The difference between the hourly wages of men and women i.e. the gender pay gap, % (SBA) 23.3% (2014) 19.7% (2020)  
Measures and activities 
In order to promote gender equality, measures in the Welfare Development Plan 2016-2023 project the following actions in the framework of gender equality: 1) to support equal economic independence of men and women and to increase gender equality at all levels of decision-making and governance; 2) to decrease the role of gender stereotypes and their negative impact in the daily lives of men and women, in the decision-making process and in the development of the economy and society 3) to guarantee institutional capability to promote gender equality, including more efficient implementation of legal protections and gender mainstreaming.  
The Strategy on the Prevention of Violence 2015-2020 targets the prevention of family violence (violence in intimate relationships), sexual violence and human trafficking. In the strategy, violence prevention is divided into three levels: universal prevention, the protection of victims, and dealing with the results of violence. In accordance with the Gender Equality Act gender equality must be considered in the planning and implementation of all national, regional and institutional strategies, policies and action plans. 
In Estonia the institution of the Gender Equality and Equal Treatment Commissioner has been created in order to help people protect their rights and prevent discrimination. The Commissioner is responsible for guaranteeing all men and women equal rights and opportunities in all spheres of society. In addition the Commissioner is responsible for the equal treatment of representatives of different minority groups.  
In order to change attitudes concerning gender equality, actions are taken to increase the awareness of people about gender stereotypes and their negative impact and in order to favour a more equal division of caring responsibilities and unpaid household work between men and women. In order to prevent the reproduction of outdated gender stereotypes and to promote gender equality via the media, there is cooperation with media organisations, new media channels and the self-regulative organs of the media. In order to promote gender equality in education and through education (including basic education) activities supporting the systemic integration of gender equality-related topics into the curricula and teaching materials on all levels and into the additional training programmes of educational workers and teachers are being carried out. 
In order to secure the economic independence of men and women, it is important to support the opportunities of women to participate in employment and to reduce the stereotypes in society and in education in general. Therefore, it is important to help achieve a more equal distribution of the obligations related to the upbringing of children and the care responsibilities for adult family members between men and women and to increase the accessibility of services reducing caring responsibilities and improving their quality. 
In order to reduce the gender pay gap, men and women need to be promoted equally within the labour market, since inequality in the labour market increases inequality in other spheres of life. Political measures mostly comprise actions related to regulation, information, training and analysis. The actions are targeted to the general public as well as specific target groups and institutions, including employers, education workers, legal specialists and policymakers. In order to help reduce the gender pay gap the surveillance powers of the Labour Inspectorate have been increased to ensure equal pay for men and women for equal work. Informational and analytic activities will be continued, the purpose of which is to increase awareness in different social institutions of the gender pay gap and its causes and effects.  
Of the NGOs, the Estonian Women's Studies and Resource Centre deals with spreading information on human rights and gender equality, improving awareness concerning human rights and promoting cooperation between men and women in all spheres of life. In 2011 the Estonian Women's Studies and Resource Centre conducted an analysis on Estonia's sustainable development strategy from the perspective of gender equality. In addition projects on gender equality in jobs and education have been carried out.  
6.6 Goal 6. Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all  
 
Estonia's goals and the situation in general  
 
The goal of the Government is to guarantee every citizen access to high-quality, clean drinking water at an acceptable price. According to the latest data 97% of consumers receive good-quality drinking water from the general water supply system (in 2013 the share was 91%).  
In addition the target of the Government is to improve the condition of waters. The purpose is to guarantee that during research and use of natural resources the Estonian groundwater resources would not be damaged, and to maintain the quality of groundwater reserves.  
One of the targets of the Rural Development Plan is to improve the use of fertilisers and pesticides in order to develop the general quality of the water management. An important target is to enlarge the nitrate-sensitive area in order to protect the surface and ground water.  
Indicator  Current situation Target  Share of consumers receiving drinking water from the general water supply system (%)  (SBA) 97%

Measures and activities 
 
Environmental requirements coming from EU legislation apply on the water sector. In order to fulfil these requirements, the Government and the local authorities have made considerable investments into the water management infrastructure. The goal of supporting the development of water management is to guarantee quality drinking water and waste water collection and treatment, which in turn helps to improve the situation of the Estonian water bodies and the Baltic Sea. While in 2012 the share of waste water collection areas with population equivalents over 2000 was 66%, by 2015 the share was 87%. The Government will continue to support the foundation and renovation of the water treatment facilities of towns and cities.  
The three water basins of Estonia affect the situation of the Baltic Sea. Estonia is part of the Convention of the Protection of the Sea Environment of the Baltic Sea (HELCOM). The European Community and the Baltic Sea countries are parties to the convention.  
In order to improve the overall situation of Estonia's water bodies, water management plans are implemented, the purpose of which is to improve the situation of the rivers, lakes and coastal waters, flood prevention and keeping the sediments and nutrients from escaping the fields and forest through ditches and small streams. In addition nitrate sensitive areas have been formed in regions of intensive agricultural production with stricter environmental standards in order to protect the ground and surface waters. 
To bring an example of the actions in the area of improving the situation of the water environment and clean drinking water on the part of NGOS, the Estonian Water Companies Union has done considerable work in order to improve water conservation and promoting the drinking of tap water.  
6.7 Goal 7. Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all  
 
Estonia's goals and the situation in general  
 
The Energy Policy of the Estonian government is based on the EU's framework of climate and energy policy, the main goals of which are: to increase the share of renewable energy to 27% of final energy consumption by 2030; to increase energy efficiency by 27% by 2030; and reduce the amount of greenhouse gases. 
The goal of the new The Estonian National Development Plan of the Energy Sector 2030is to guarantee consumers access to fuel and energy with a reasonable price and in conformity with environmental regulations. The aim is to diversify the energy portfolio and to improve energy efficiency. The goal of the Government is that by 2030 50% of Estonia's electricity will be produced from renewable sources and 80% of the heat consumed in Estonia would be produced from domestic biofuels. There is also a target level concerning the final energy consumption.  
In terms of energy dependence, Estonia is one of the least dependent countries on imported energy in Europe. This is primarily due to oil shale. At the same time most of Estonia's greenhouse gases and negative environmental impacts derive from the oil shale sector. The target of the new Development Plan for Oil Shale 2030 is to increase the efficiency of oil shale mining and use and reduce the negative environmental impacts of oil shale.

(2030) Measures and activities 
 
In order to diversify Estonia’s sources of energy, a broader approach is needed in the coproduction of electricity and heat, and the share of wind energy and biomass energy as well as other renewable energies needs to be increased. The share of renewable energy has been increased due to support mechanisms for combined heat and power plants producing electricity and for producers of renewable energy. The policy measures of the Government as well as the competitive price of renewable energy solutions in heating have helped to increase the share of renewable energy sources from 32.7% in 2007 to 52.9% by 2015. The Government has taken action in order to create opportunities for Estonia's renewable energy producers to take part in the flexible cooperation mechanisms articulated in the EU directive for renewable energy.  
In addition, the state contributes to the promotion of energy efficiency and energy conservation in construction and heating mainly via support mechanisms. Support is given to the reconstruction of the present building stock and the construction of nearly zero-energy buildings and renewing the district heating systems. The revenues from CO2 trading schemes have been used for financing the programmes supporting investments into energy efficiency, also reconstruction of street lighting in 7 cities for achieving energy efficiency. 
Saving energy in all sectors will be helped horizontally by developing a smart grid and in this way improving the capacity of electricity consumption management in Estonia. Developing the smart grid will help to reduce loss of energy during transmission, help to optimise the production of energy, develop diffused production and connect larger amounts of renewable energy into the grid. Improved functionality in the electricity grid will help to develop new innovative services for all electricity users. The creation of energy cooperatives will also help to contribute to energy savings. A corresponding legal framework has been created in order to favour this.  
Estonia is moving fast in the development of green energy technologies. Windmills, solar panels, inverters, technology for smart houses, software solutions and much more are being produced with the help of private capital. Many of these technologies are already successfully on the export markets, while many are still on the level of prototypes. For the further rapid development of the sector a partnership between the state and entrepreneurs is necessary.  
In order to increase the share of renewable energy in the transport sector, a support measure will be created for the production and consumption of biomethane. In order to support the use of electrical vehicles a network of quick chargers has been established across the whole of Estonia, supported by the ELMO programme.  
In the new The Estonian National Development Plan of the Energy Sector 2030, the Government’s aim is that the necessary changes in the energy sector and related sectors would be supported by the economic environment and market regulations, while interference by government means should be an exception rather than a rule. State interference is necessary in order to guarantee infrastructure related to energy security; guarantee cross-border connections in the electricity and gas supply; guarantee the reserves of liquid fuel and gas in Estonia as regulated by law; guarantee the supply of heat production in order to cover the bases and the top burden; and guarantee the legislative background to promote sparse- and micro production.  
Since 2013, an open energy market has been operating in Estonia, creating competition for the electricity producers and sellers and providing the consumers a choice for buying electricity. In order to open up the gas market, ownership of the gas network was unbundled. Further efforts are needed in order to make the gas market operate similarly to the electricity market. Attention must be paid to the operation of the gas market in the whole region. 
 
Startup Estonia, Kredex and Tehnopol offer supporting services for the sector, help in finding partners and in expanding to external markets. With the help of Enterprise Estonia entrepreneurship clusters operating in the energy sector have been financed, as well as centres of competence and other projects.  
 
The Estonian Environmental Investment Centre in cooperation with several NGOs and companies is organising a competition for students, the Negavatt, where students are presenting solutions to save resources at the universities, including energy resources. Their idea can be a product, a service, a technological solution, a method or a campaign, or changing ways of thinking and hence behaviour. 
 
From the NGOS the Estonian Renewable Energy Association is promoting the sphere of renewable energy by representing the producers of renewable energy in discussions with government institutions, introducing the solutions and opportunities of renewable energy to the general public, taking part in debates on energy, being involved in R&D activities and organising trainings on solutions of renewable energy and energy saving. The World Energy Council National Committee WEC Estonia helps to promote a sustainable power supply of energy and its use, organises conferences and seminars and conducts thematic analyses.  
 
6.8 Goal 8. Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all  
 
Estonia's goals and the situation in general  
 
Promoting economic growth and increasing employment are among the main goals of the Government of Estonia. Immediately after the 2008-2009 economic downturn economic growth was restored quite quickly. However, in the last few years it has been below expectations and potential. Despite the growth of unemployment during the economic crisis, people have become economically more active and there has been a steady growth in recent years in labour force participation. The Government aims to lower the taxes on labour. The goal is to increase productivity and financing and to make more productive and effective use of the local resources. One of the aims of Estonia's Agenda of Competitiveness is to develop environmentally-friendly economic and energy sectors, paying attention to the energy and resource effectiveness of the economy.  
The aim of the Government is also to increase incomes and promote entrepreneurship. The aim is to increase the employment rates in the 20-64 age group to at least 75.7% by 2019. The aim is to lower the share of long-term unemployment to 2.6% by 2019. In order to have continued economic development, the goal of the Government of Estonia is to increase productivity per working-age person to 73.6% by 2016 and to 79.1% by 2019. The goal of the Government is to develop a more productive, sustainable and efficient use of local resources. While distributing the natural resources belonging to the state an important target is to take into consideration the efficiency of the processing technologies and resource efficiency.

(SBA; EGAP, SE indicators) 13.1% (2015)  10% (2020)  
Measures and activities 
 
One of the main challenges in the next few years will be achieving a faster growth of productivity. The state can help by supporting investments in order to increase research intensity and add value in various fields. 
In order to support companies in responding to the challenges of the economy, financial measures will be created to make the processes of companies more effective and to support the companies' ambitions for growth, in order to offer better quality consulting services and training for setting long-term goals, to work out the system for monitoring the effects of entrepreneurial support and to consolidate entrepreneurial decisions. Measures supporting exports and enhancing cooperation will continue and the state will offer support to entrepreneurs in entering foreign markets via a more efficient use of export representatives.  
Soon, the Green Book on Estonian Industrial Policy will be ready, explaining how to make our industry more competitive in the longer term.  
Indicators of Estonia's labour market are in good shape and it is important to retain the current employment levels during the next few years. In order to achieve this various labour market measures targeted to different target groups need to be developed (measures for young people, long-term unemployed and inactive people with reduced work capacity, non-Estonians and the elderly). Measures to provide supplementary education and retraining to prevent unemployment are being developed. It is important to maintain the capacity of workers to work through early interventions in order to prevent workplace health damage, to cover the health damages and keep the person at work. 
In 2016, the capacity for work ability reform began, the aim of which is to help people with reduced work capacity get a job. The ability of every person with reduced work capacity to be active in society will be assessed and on the basis of that the person will receive help in finding opportunities in the labour market. In order to find solutions suitable for both sides the future employers of these people will be contacted. 
In 2016, the coordination system for the labour markets skills and needs - OSKA - was started, providing information about the key skills and professions needed on the labour market. In 2017 an analysis of the needs for skills in the labour market and training offered in 10 sectors will be finished. Once a year the general OSKA report on changes in the needs of the labour market, developments in the labour markets and the trends affecting them is compiled. 
From the NGO sector, the Individual School Development Foundation in cooperation with the Ministry of the Interior has initiated a STEP programme in order to help increase the employment of young people with a legally-troubled background and support them in beginning their studies or starting a new job and keeping it. Youth Prop Up is part of a governmental action plan, Estonian Youth Guarantee, initiated by the EU; the aim of which is to help young people who have lost their jobs or left schools to return to society as fast as possible. The youth workers at Youth Prop Up support the young people by helping them figure out what they want. In addition to gaining experiences through youth work, the Youth Prop Ups help young people to establish contacts with educational institutions, organisations and employers. 
In the framework of development cooperation, Estonia has supported its partner countries with more than 2.9 million EUR during 2011-2015, helping them to create an economic environment suitable for entrepreneurship and opening up access to the global trading market. In addition to development cooperation, Estonia is a firm supporter of the liberalisation of global trade rules and the reduction of export support and customs restrictions via the WTO. During 2016-2020 Estonia will continue with these activities, contributing even more to small enterprises, the agricultural sector of the partner countries, developing tourism, creating start-ups and favouring their development. 
 
6.9 Goal 9. Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialisation and foster innovation  
Estonia's goals and the situation in general  
 
In the Government of Estonia's Action Plan as well as in the Budget Strategy much attention is paid to the creation of a high-quality and modern infrastructure. The goal of the Government of Estonia is to have decent flight and maritime connections and a good-quality road network. The aim of the transport system is to allow the free movement of goods and people in an accessible, comfortable, fast, safe and sustainable manner.  
In addition, the aim is to support the introduction of new technologies and guarantee fast and easy internet access across the whole country. Estonia's aim is to reduce the share of people not using the internet to 5% by 2020 and increase the share of fixed internet connections with the speed of 100 Mbp/s or higher to 60% of the total amount of fixed connections. 
The goal of the Government is to reach the level of 3% of GDP in the financing of R&D (whereas the share of R&D of the public sector should be 1% and share of the private sector R&D should be 2% of the GDP). The Government aims to increase the financing of industrial research in order to support the smart specialisation of the economy and innovation. 
Indicator Current situation Target Level of investment into R&D from the GDP (%), including investment into the private sector R&D (% of GDP)  (SBA;EGAP, Estonia 2020, SE indicators) 1.44/ 0.64 (2014) 3/2

(2020)  
Measures and activities 
 
Although operating the international passenger transport will be commerce based and will therefore be dependent on business interests, the public sector is able to favour the creation and maintenance of international connections and make them more comfortable by improving the quality of the infrastructure. 
Due to Estonia's location and its small population, competitive cross-border and national connections are most important for living and the business environment. In guaranteeing national mobility roads and road transport have an important role. When planning the road networks, the safety of all road users, including pedestrians and cyclists, is taken into account. The state will continue to finance the road network, its maintenance and development. The security of pedestrian and cycling traffic will be improved and its share increased by the construction of roads for light vehicles.  
In addition a fast train service will help to shorten the national distances. Railway transport must allow large-scale transport of passengers and goods in an environmentally-friendly and fast mode. The state has invested into improving the quality of inter-city rail services. In addition, a direct connection with the EU rail network will be established via Rail Baltic. The construction work for Rail Baltic will begin in 2018 and the connection should be operational by 2025.  
Because of the location of labour and its movement special attention needs to be paid to the synergy of different means of transport and the junctions. In order to guarantee the user comfort of public transport, the timetables should be harmonised and relevant infrastructure created to facilitate the movement of passengers as well as goods from one means of transport to another and in the longer term an integrated plan to enable a choice between various means of transport will be in place. 
Because of Estonia's location the role of maritime transport is also important. Estonia has good maritime connections with Finland and Sweden. Regarding the national connections, the state will continue to invest in the improvement of connections between the mainland and the islands - ports are being reconstructed and ferry connections provided.  
Since international cooperation is key to Estonia's business, scientific, cultural and educational environment, it is important to pay attention to international connections, especially to flight connections and cross-border roads and railways. To this end, investments in extending the airport runways, expanding the terminal and improving the quality of technical devices will continue, construction requirements for roads will be updated and the safety and comfort of junctions of different means of transport will be improved.  
In the interests of well-balanced regional development, in addition to the international roads the secondary roads also need to receive dustless road surfacing. Preparations have to be made to interconnect the public transport systems and continue with the construction of high-quality internet connection infrastructure. 
Although currently 90% of Estonia's territory is covered with broadband internet connection, the state will continue to invest into improving the accessibility of internet connections in the areas where so far broadband services have been inaccessible for the end-users. The EstWin project aiming to cover Estonia with superfast broadband will be continued in cooperation with the telecommunications operators. By 2018, a fiberoptic cable network will be ready, reaching all settlements in Estonia, bringing a superfast (100Mbps+) internet connection to within 1.5 km distance from 98% of households, enterprises and settlements. In addition the state will invest into improving digital literacy. As a result of the programme the number of computer and internet users will grow but also the number of ICT specialists in the total number of employed people will increase. 
Estonia's business environment is considered to be favourable in comparison with other countries. Still more specific challenges need to be addressed. Regarding the regulatory framework, we need changes in legislation, with which to stimulate the implementation of high-priority policies in the context of economic development. Administrative burden needs to be assessed as well as reduced continuously and systematically. Preserving a stable tax environment will encourage entrepreneurs to invest in the development of their businesses.  
In order to create a market for innovative goods and services, the state's capacity and readiness to act as contractor of innovative solutions will be increased by favouring the creation of innovative solutions, their procurement and realisation of demonstration projects. The state supports industrial research into the increase of smart specialisation, favouring in this way cooperation between companies, universities and other research institutions.  
The start-up industry will be boosted via the engagement and growth of managerial competences in start-ups and their support systems, investing into the swift creation of prototypes and bringing minimum products on the market and by supporting the spread of teaching modules dealing with start-up entrepreneurship, forming interdisciplinary teams and favouring the creation of spin-offs. According to the Startup Compass Study, by the end of 2015 there were 500-700 start-up companies in Estonia, in various phases of development. In total the start-ups in Estonia employ around 2,300 people, and more than 80% of them are located in Estonia.  
The measures for making industries more energy- and resource-efficient aim at making the industrial processes more environmentally friendly and sustainable. In order to increase the awareness of resource efficiency, train specialists, support resource auditing in companies and investments to improve the energy and resource efficiency of the production systems.  
In 2015, Estonia took part in the composition of the World Bank 2016 World Development Report on the internet and development (World Development Report subtitled Digital Dividends), President Toomas Hendrik Ilves being the co-chair of the Advisory Forum for the report. It was concluded in the report that countries which have created strong responsible institutions and have implemented widespread legal reforms supporting the digital solutions gain the most from ICT. In the report Estonia is brought out as a successful example on how technical solutions can be the basis of democracy and transparency and support fast economic growth. 
6.10 Goal 10. Reduce inequality within and among countries  
 
Estonia's goals and the situation in general  
 
The target of the Government Action Plan in 2015-2019 is to be active in the protection and promotion of fundamental liberal values - freedom, democracy and human rights - in Estonia, in the EU and beyond the borders of the EU by implementing bilateral and multilateral development cooperation projects. In order to decrease inequality between countries, the aim of the Government is to foster diplomatic, economic and cultural relations with other countries, provide development aid and engage in development cooperation with partner countries, if it serves the national interests of Estonia.  
According to the Addis Ababa agreement on financing of development, the recommendation for all developed countries is to contribute 0.7% of their GNI to development aid and to have a concrete timeline for reaching this goal. The aim of the Government is to keep the share of the budget spent on development cooperation and humanitarian aid at least on the level of 2015 (0.15%) and aims to reach the level of 0.33% of the GNI - within the deadlines of Agenda 2030. During the years 20042014 the share of Estonia's development aid from the GNI has increased considerably. While in 2004 the respective share was 0.02% of the GNI, in 2015 the share had increased to 0.15% of the GNI.  
In 2003, the Parliament adopted the principles of Estonia's development cooperation, according to which the aim of Estonia's development cooperation is to promote peace, democracy and human rights and to provide social and economic stability and reduce poverty in the world in accordance with internationally adopted principles of sustainable development.  
The Strategy for Estonian Development Cooperation and Humanitarian Aid 2016-2020 aims to help eradicate global poverty and achieve Sustainable Development Goals. Estonia considers it important to systematically support the relief of human crises in order to alleviate human suffering and reduce possible immigration pressures. The priority partners of Estonia's development cooperation are Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, Afghanistan and Belarus.  
Considering Estonia's foreign policy goals and the international agreements on contributing more development cooperation instruments into the most vulnerable countries, Estonia will continue to react flexibly to the needs of other countries, especially the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing States and Small Island Developing States in the areas where Estonia can offer concrete added value.  
The necessity of development cooperation in order to guarantee security and stability in Estonia as well as in the wider world is also stressed in Estonia's security policy goals.

Measures and activities 
 
Since 1998, Estonia has systematically dealt with development cooperation. The focus of Estonia's Development Cooperation and Humanitarian Aid Strategy 2016-202010 is to contribute more development cooperation instruments to the most vulnerable countries and to continue to react flexibly to the needs of other countries, especially the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing States and Small Island Developing States in the areas where Estonia can offer concrete added value.  
According to the Estonian Internal Security Agenda 2015-2020, the Estonian citizenship and migration policy must favour Estonia's development and provide internal security, with the support of a knowledge-based and comprehensive approach to citizenship and migration and an open socio-economic environment. Measures and resources to guarantee Estonia's readiness for receiving a larger number of applications for international protection are included in the development plan. People who have received international protection will have welcome facilities and they will receive services to help them adapt, cope and integrate (e.g. support persons, counselling, rehabilitation services, lessons in Estonian, labour market services), based on their cultural, gender, religious, linguistic and other characteristics. High-quality international protection proceedings need to be guaranteed and the knowledge and skills of officials improved. There will be adaptation programmes for new immigrants, helping the foreigners settling in Estonia receive introductory knowledge and skills in order to manage in Estonia. In addition, recruiting labour needed by Estonian employers will be favoured and a corresponding counselling service developed in order to help both immigrants and companies and organisations employing them.  
Besides the Estonian national policies, the EU has an important role in directing the immigration policies. In addition to the EU's internal measures and the review of current immigration, international protection and readmission policy, the root causes of the migration in countries of origin need to be addressed. It is in Estonia's interest to support all measures helping to deal with migration already in the region of origin, including development cooperation and helping the source and transit countries. 
In order to support the equal opportunities of people with a different mother tongue than Estonian, measures and activities are included in Estonia's integration agenda Integrating Estonia 2020: In order to increase the awareness of people with low levels of integration, including the recentlyarrived migrants, counselling and ICT services will be developed and implemented. Organizations with a different linguistic and cultural background will also receive financial support. 
The Welfare Development Plan 2016-2023 deals with developing the identifying feature "Diverse employer" in order to recognize the companies promoting equal opportunities, the implementation and monitoring of the implementation of the UN Persons with Disabilities Convention, aiming to improve access together with the organisations and interest groups of different sectors and increasing the efficiency equal rights protection and tolerance within society. In order to promote equal treatment, the Equal Opportunities Act was adopted, with the aim of protecting people against discrimination based on ethnicity (ethnic origin), race, skin colour, religion or beliefs, age, disability or sexual orientation.  
From the NGOs gathered under the umbrella of the Estonian Roundtable for Development Cooperation many are contributing into development cooperation, humanitarian aid and the promotion of global education.  
The mission of the NGO Mondo is to support vulnerable people and communities in self-sufficiency and increase the awareness of the Estonian public about global concerns and their possible solutions. In order to help women and people with special needs to become more self-sufficient the local communities in Ghana, Kenya and Uganda are encouraged to deal with entrepreneurship. Mondo wants to develop social entrepreneurship more vigorously. Currently, this comprises product development in Ghana and Uganda and marketing the products of these communities in Estonia and the neighbouring countries. 
The Estonian Roundtable for Development Cooperation is representing NGOs in Estonia whose main goal or important secondary goal is dealing with development cooperation and humanitarian aid. Members of the Estonian Roundtable for Development Cooperation are sending over volunteers, help to strengthen the public sector in the target countries, deal with environmental, human rights and health issues and do much more in order to promote the improvement of life quality and democracy in the developing countries. The aim of the Estonian Roundtable for Development Cooperation is to make the development cooperation policies more effective and more practical and to inform the general public about the goals and opportunities of participation in development cooperation.  
The Estonian Eastern Partnership Training Center is a foundation helping to improve the administrative capacities and capabilities for EU cooperation with the Eastern Partnership countries. 
The Estonian Centre for Human Rights is the coordinator of the diversity agreement in order to promote equal opportunities. The Diversity Agreement is a voluntary agreement and companies or public organisations joining it agree to follow the principles of diversity towards their employees as well as clients and agree to treat everyone equally. Organisations that have become part of the agreement form a community in order to share their experiences and promote the subject of equal opportunities within their own organisations as well as in the society at large. The Centre for Human Rights is focusing on equal treatment and the promotion of diversity and the human rights of migrants and asylum seekers. 
 
6.11 Goal 11. Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable  
 
Estonia's goals and the situation in general  
 
The aim of the Government is to guarantee people the feeling of living in a free and safe society, where everyone's value, involvement and contribution into the safety of the community will help to create one of the safest countries in Europe. 
In terms of regional policy, one of the most important priorities is the implementation of the administrative reform, one of the goals of which is to improve the quality of life of towns and settlements through improving the local development capacities. The Government has set the target of strengthening the capability of the local governments so that by the end of 2018 at least 95% of the people live in local municipalities, which correspond to the minimum criteria set out in the Administrative Reform Act, which enters into force on 1 July 2016. According to the Act the number of inhabitants in each local municipality should be at least 5000. 
Spatial planning is the main instrument for creating the preconditions in towns and other settlements for creating an environment where the needs and interests of the society have been taken into consideration in order to create democratic, long-term and balanced spatial development, and develop land use in order to create a high-quality living and building space, favouring environmentally-friendly and economically, culturally and socially-sustainable development. Spatial planning deals with the issues of housing, transportation, streets and roads, cultural heritage, waste management, the green spaces, resource efficiency, adapting to climate change and many other issues. The key phrases for planning are cooperation and involvement. Without these it is not possible to develop any planning in Estonia. 
An active role for the community and its cooperation is important for the quality of life of cities and settlements and their sustainable development. Special attention is paid to issues related to security. One of the aims of Estonia's Agenda for Internal Security 2015-2020 is to implement the community-oriented model and cooperation in creating a safe living environment. This is based on the cooperation of the people of Estonia, the NGOs, units of local governments, state authorities, and companies and enable the discovery of problematic issues, and plan joint activities in order to prevent, alleviate and reduce danger.

(Strategy for Regional Development 2014-2020, SE indicators) 42.3% (2015) 50%  
(2020)  
Measures and activities 
 
The Government has several support programmes, the purpose of which is to support the sustainable development and good environmental conditions of towns and settlements. For example, investments are made into free and accessible health and sporting facilities, developing facilities for walking and cycling (including expanding the network for light vehicles), developing public transport and improving child care facilities. In addition the energy efficiency solutions for street lighting of cities have been supported.  
Since 2015, the regional development measures, financed from the EU structural funds Sustainable development of urban areas and Sustainable development or urban areas in Ida-Virumaa are open. They will support the simultaneous development of a sustainable mobility environment and the city space of Estonia's five biggest urban areas and the activities targeted at the physical, social and economic revival of urban areas in Ida-Virumaa (based on the action plans of these urban areas). 
A lot of attention is paid to the development of the public transport system, improving the access of information about public transport by taking into use information systems corresponding to the needs of people with audio and/or visual impairments. The creation of an environmentally-friendly public transport system has been supported in Tallinn, the tramways have been renovated and new energy-efficient trams purchased. A national charging network for electrical vehicles has been constructed. The Government is planning to introduce measures to support the creation of public transport and gas station infrastructure run on biogas.  
The waste management program supports collecting hazardous waste, developing the infrastructure for separate collection and recycling of waste, as avoidance of environmental pollution from waste, and waste reduction, following today's principles of waste management.  
The Climate Change Adaptation Development Plan is being developed in order to increase awareness of climate change and develop resilience. The adaptation measures in the strategy are targeted to the increase of awareness and resilience and to the implementation of the precautionary principle in reducing climate and weather risks. The Estonian Action Plan for Internal Security foresees the actions for developing risk communication in order to increase the awareness of the population not only of dangers in traffic and fire, but also in terms of floods, pollution and forest fires. The goal of these activities is to make people aware of the most imminent risks in dangerous situations, how we are prepared for these on a national and local level and what each individual should do in order to be ready for an unexpected major disaster.  
In 2017 new county planning schemes will be imposed in all Estonian counties in order to agree on the main principles of spatial planning for the region, based on the National Action Plan Estonia 2030+ and the public processes conducted in the counties. The main traits of the county centres are drawn out in the county planning schemes, supporting the accessibility of services in the urban centres as well as outside. County planning schemes are the basis for developing the general planning schemes of the local authorities, directing spatial planning on a local level, providing the main direction for spatial planning and the main criteria for land use by the local authorities formed as a result of the administrative reform. 
The Local Authorities Reform will be conducted in order to improve the quality of services offered by the local government and to guarantee sustainability. The aim of the Local Authorities Reform, as agreed upon in the Government Action Plan, is to create strong local authorities able to integrally develop life on the local level and where good quality and accessible public services are guaranteed to people. The Government favours the self-initiated merger of local authorities in order to create authorities with a larger territory and a larger number of inhabitants.  
In order to create and provide a safe living environment, county safety councils have been initiated with the aim of promoting cooperation between the government institutions, the local authorities, the companies and the NGOs and a community-centred approach to the prevention and reduction of accidents, offences and crime. Also county-wide support measures have been initiated in order to support community-based security initiatives, the priority of which are projects directed toward cooperation and the promotion of local initiatives. An important action is also the development of the national support system in order to increase the capacity of the local authorities in dealing with issues related to internal security. 
Heritage protection reform is being prepared, the aim of which is the long-term preservation of the key parts of Estonian culture. The implementation of the reform will guarantee a better balance between the rights and obligations of owners of heritage sites, creating a new support mechanism; will increase the administrative and counselling capacities of the National Heritage Board and connects the study, presentation and preservation of the heritage in museums and in heritage protection areas.  
The planning officials of local authorities (including those of cities) have received seminars and training on spatial planning, supporting the development of sustainable, inclusive and safe cities. Meetings, for example, have been held in order to discuss safety in planning, the role of planning in developing an environment for entrepreneurship, on the assessment of the social impact of planning and about planning with a shrinking population. 
An example of the activities of NGOs is the Urban Laboratory, dealing with the development of sustainable and inclusive cities, counselling the local authorities, introducing modern trends in Estonia and improving the awareness of people about the living environment. The trends, issues and good practices of urban development in Europe as well as outside are studied on a daily basis.  
An NGO, Tallinn Bicycle Week, is promoting cycling, introducing the culture of cycling and organising an annual Green Thinking bicycle festival in Tallinn and organising cycling events in other cities in Estonia.  
Tallinn’s Old Town is part of the UNESCO global cultural heritage list. Tallinn is a very special, intact and well-preserved Norther-European Hanseatic City, where the characteristics of a unique economic and social community are very well preserved. 
Community initiatives in cities have become more widespread in recent years. The jointlyorganised events by the communities in different parts of the city - the Uue Maailma Festival, the Kalamaja Festival, the Festival of the Green Gates in Nõmme are examples of this.  
NGOs and volunteers are also engaged in preventing the perils to public order as well as in dealing with the aftermath of disasters. The activities of Neighbour's Watch, Voluntary Maritime and Lake Rescue Teams, the Estonian Community of Assistant Police, the Rescue Union and other NGOs dealing with guaranteeing security in local authorities are also supported. This enables an increase in community responsibility and regional cooperation on security issues.  
   
6.12 Goal 12. Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns  
 
Estonia's goals and the situation in general  
 
One of the aims of the Government Action Plan is a more productive, sustainable and effective use of local resources. Material productivity (the ratio of GDP to local raw materials) must increase by at least 10% by 2019. One of the goals of the tax policy is to shift the tax burden from income taxes to taxing consumption, use of natural resources and pollution of the environment.  
The situation in waste management has improved significantly in recent years. Landfills noncompliant to environmental requirements have been closed down and systems of separate waste collection and reuse have been developed. The actions of the State Waste Management Plan are targeted to the reduction and reuse of waste. According to the Waste Act the share of household waste in reuse must be at least 50% of the total weight of household waste by 2020. One of the big tasks for Estonia is to reduce the amount of waste from oil shale. About half of the amount of oil shale that has been mined will become oil shale ashes during electricity generation process.  
The number of companies using various environmental management practices has increased in the past few years. There are 14 companies using the ISO 14001:2004 and 521 companies using ISO 14001:2015. In 2016 the Eco-Management and Audit Scheme is being used by 7 companies operating in 56 different fields. In order to promote environmentally-friendly and resource-efficient services, the Government in its Action Programme has started to prefer environmentally-friendly solutions in doing public procurements, if possible.

Measures and activities 
 
In recent years, the Government of Estonia has been implementing the so-called green tax reform, the purpose of which is to reduce the share of environmental and consumption taxes and the reduction of income and labour taxes.  
Using resource-efficient solutions and introducing environmentally-friendly technologies is favoured in different support measures, in order to increase the awareness of companies about energy and resources, train specialists, support the conduction of resource-efficiency audits in companies and investments targeted towards improving the energy and resource efficiency of the production systems.  
The state is looking for possibilities for implementing the environmentally-friendly public procurements more efficiently. A study was conducted in order to select four priority fields where obligatory environmentally-friendly criteria will be implemented.  
In order to promote waste management, measures will be implemented via the Waste Management Plan. Producer responsibility and recycling organisations have been created, focusing on the recycling of packaging and problematic products and on the operation of the national network of packaging and problematic waste collection and organising their recycling. The amounts of waste disposed in landfills is decreasing due to the obligation to separate collection of waste and restrictions on the collection of bio-waste, also on the gradual increase of pollution taxes and developing new methods of recycling. The packaging refund system contributes to helping children in addition to contributing to the recycling of packaging. Since 2011 those who return empty containers are able to donate to a charity foundation supporting cultural experiences for children from vulnerable families.  
Many EU initiatives supported by Estonia are targeted to resource efficiency, for example, the package of circular economy, the aim of which is to find solutions to issues related to the economy and environment via increasing resource efficiency, involving the whole value chain (including sustainable consumption, production and waste management) and innovation, enabling the development of new markets and business models. A broad-based action plan is part of the package, comprising measures for achieving real progress and a proposal on waste including longterm goals for waste reuse and reduction of the amount of waste in landfills. Collecting products at the end of their life-cycle and separating materials enables their use for the production of new products. 
 
In order to guarantee the environmentally-friendly and economically-effective use of oil shale the development of the best possible technology is supported in the framework of the National Development Plan for the Use of Oil Shale, reducing the residual pollution, increasing resource efficiency and reducing the amount of waste created and increasing the amount of reusable waste. 
In terms of consumption an increase in awareness helps to develop resource efficiency and environmental friendliness. In the framework of the Environment Awareness Programme the development of more environmentally-friendly consumption patterns of adults and families is supported. Information campaigns, festivals, fairs and nature evenings are held. Promoting environmental education in schools has an important role. Environment and sustainable development are included in the curricula of basic schools and gymnasiums and have to be taken into account both in arranging the learning environment as well as in teaching the subjects. Environmentally-friendly consumption patterns among students are developed and in order to learn about the ecological balance, study trips, environmental projects by schools and acquiring teaching material is supported. By the end of 2016, an analysis of the implementation of the topic "environment and sustainable development" in education will be completed. The goal of the study is to provide a facts-based input for compiling a joint action plan by the Ministry of Education and Science and by the Ministry of the Environment in order to promote education about the environment and sustainable development. The study will also provide an overview of the implementation of one concrete topic in the national curriculum. 
 
Estonia's policies on education concerning sustainable development have been mentioned as best practices in the report of the third phase of the decade of the implementation of the UN Education on Sustainable Development Learning from each other: achievements, challenges and ways forward, which was introduced in Batumi at the high-level meeting of the UNECE in June 2016.  
In the last few years, the subject of food waste has received more attention. The state has commissioned studies in order to estimate the amount of food loss in different sectors, in domestic households as well as in the retail- and wholesale industries, in the food industry and the agricultural sector. The food waste roundtable comprised of representatives of different ministries gathers in order to find solutions for the prevention of food loss.  
Every year a prize for the most environmentally-friendly company for implementing measures with a positive effect on society is given out on the initiative of the Ministry of the Environment.  
From the NGOs, the Forum Corporate Social Responsibility is uniting companies that consider it important to follow the principles of sustainability in entrepreneurship and to implement these principles consistently in their work. The Forum is an organisation with a strong members' network, publishing the corporate social responsibility index, an important assessment criteria amongst responsible entrepreneurs.  
Let's Do It is a campaign that was started in 2008, and which is now a national clean-up day with the purpose of investing in the development of the Estonian living environment and civic society. Today the Let's Do It campaign is present in more than 100 countries. Different regions have organised their own clean-up days based on the Estonian Clean Up Day. On September 8th 2018 the Global World Clean-up Day will take place with participants from more than 150 countries.  
6.13 Goal 13. Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts  
 
Estonia's goals and the situation in general  
 
The 2015 Paris Agreement is an important step in tackling climate change. The target of the EU is to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases by at least 40% by 2030. The Energy Policy of the Estonian government is based on the EU's framework of climate and energy policy, the main goals of which are: to increase the share of renewable energy to 27% of final energy consumption by 2030, increase energy efficiency by 27% by 2030 and reduce the amount of greenhouse gases.  
The target of the EU is to reduce the amount of emissions by 20% by 2020 as compared to 1990. This aim is to be achieved by combining two mechanisms, the trading system of assigned amount units (AAU) and national obligations for sectors outside the trading system. National obligations are set on sectors beyond the EU AAU system (buildings, agriculture, waste), except LULUCF11, a sector where Estonia's emissions must not increase by more than 11% by 2020 as compared to 2005. So far this level has not been exceeded. 
Although Estonia's per capita share in producing greenhouse gas emissions is the second largest in Europe, as a country Estonia's share is small in the global context. Estonia’s share is about 0.4% of the total greenhouse gas emission of the EU countries. Nevertheless, the aim of the Government is to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases and to move toward a low carbon dioxide economy.

Measures and activities 
 
In order to direct better the fields of climate change adaptation and climate change alleviation in 2014, the Estonian Climate Policy and Development plan for adaptation to climate change was initiated. The Climate Policy document will be adopted at the Parliament and it will provide directions in the sectors of energy, transport, industry, agriculture, forestry and waste management in order to move towards achieving Estonia's long-term climate policy vision to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050 as compared to 1990. The aim of the development plan for adapting to climate change is to guarantee the readiness and capacities of Estonia for adaptation to climate change. In order to define the risks related to floods and define the measures mitigating the risks, management plans for flood risks for Estonian river basins have been composed together with measure plans, the implementation of which will either take place at the national, local or company, organisation or individual level. 
Estonia has ratified the Kyoto protocol and has taken part in the trading system of Kyoto greenhouse gas emissions. The assets earned from the participating in the assigned amount units trading scheme have been directed via the green investment scheme into environmentally-friendly projects or programs aiming at the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The renovation of district heating into a renewable-energy-based heating system, development of wind energy, and the reconstruction of the street light system of seven cities into becoming more energy efficient are examples that have been supported.  
Estonia has decided to direct part of the income gained from the auctions of greenhouse gas emissions into the international cooperation on climate change. According to the Estonian State Budget Strategy every year until 2018 1 million EUR will be targeted to this.  
In cooperation between the Government and private companies, the Estonian pre-competition for the Europe-wide sustainable technology ideas competition ClimateLaunchpad was arranged. The purpose is to support starting companies dealing with green technology, services or products helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Last year an Estonian startup ReLaDe came in third in the final European competition of ClimateLaunchpad. They created a reusable laundry system. Another Estonian startup was among the best 15 competitors - Reverse Resources helps to use the large volume of used clothing by offering a platform for designers where they can buy residual fabrics from the big Asian clothing factories. In 2016 the pan-European final of ClimateLaunchpad will take place in Tallinn.  
In May 2015, Garage48 GreenTech Tallinn was organised, the purpose of which was to find solutions helping to alleviate climate change and to cope with the impact of climate change. In addition the best IT solutions developed during the event got the support of 50,000 EUR. 
In the framework of development cooperation, Estonia contributed 5.8 million EUR in 2011-2015 to the sustainable development of its partner countries. Most of it (80%) was assets to support developing countries in alleviating climate change and coping with it. During 2016-2020 sustainable development in partner countries will be supported via bilateral projects and via contributions to multilateral organisations and sectoral funds. Attention will be paid to the alleviation and adjustment of climate change, for example by supporting projects in renewable energy resources, supporting energy efficiency of those dealing with the efficiency of transport and industry, and supporting administrative capacities related to climate change or solutions for adjusting to climate change.  
Estonia has supported the project Strengthening Climate Change Adaptation in Rural Communities, for Agriculture and Environmental Management in Afghanistan which is part of a bigger project Environmental Cooperation for Peacebuilding-Phase III of the UNEP. The key output of the project is to increase the administrative capacity of the local authorities and to create national action plans in order to tackle the risks accompanying climate change. The focus of the project was sustainable use of water, land and environment in different pilot areas. In addition the project contributed to the creation of an academic and scientific platform for creating a centre for environmental data. It also contributed to the training of officials and overall capacity. 
Estonia is participating in the cooperation project of the International Telecommunications Union Applying the component of adjusting to climate change to satellite connection capacity and developing crisis communication in the small island developing countries in the Pacific. The aim of the project is to develop a low-cost, trustworthy and diverse satellite communication capacity in the Pacific region. The same resources will be used for communication services in crisis situations in order to guarantee the safety of society. The Estonian financial contribution - will be used to buy solar panels in order to guarantee energy in regions where access to energy is haphazard and in order to prepare the implementation strategy for the adaptation to climate change for the islands. 
6.14 Goal 14. Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development  
 
Estonia complies with relevant international agreements and conventions, such as the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the International Maritime Organization (IMO) conventions for the safety of marine environment, and the Baltic Marine Environment Protection Convention (HELCOM), etc., to conserve and sustainably use the marine environment. 
Due to the geographical position of Estonia, the government focuses mainly on Baltic Sea protection in the matters of marine environment conservation. The Baltic Sea is small on a global scale; however, as one of the largest bodies of brackish water, it is ecologically unique and highly sensitive to man-made environmental impacts. The government's action programme aims to contribute to a cleaner Baltic Sea by improving the quality of bodies of water. Within the framework of the Baltic Sea Action Plan and the European Union Marine Strategy Framework Directive, Estonia plans activities for marine conservation.  
The Estonian Fisheries Policy is based on the European Union Common Fisheries Policy, which aims to improve the implementation of sustainable fisheries and aquaculture in unharmed marine environments that are able to support economically viable industry by ensuring employment opportunities for coastal communities. The priorities of the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund for the 2014-2020 operational programme are: to develop affordable, sustainable and profitable environments for fisheries, aquaculture and fish processing; to improve the economic viability of coastal and inland fisheries; to ensure optimal use of resources; to enhance the effectiveness of monitoring; to promote cooperation between research and development institutions, educational institutions and the fisheries sector.

Measures and activities 
 
The action plan for marine strategy, drawn up according to the European Union's Marine Strategy Framework Directive, contains measures to preserve marine biodiversity, control the spread of invasive species, reduce eutrophication, improve marine pollution response capacity and develop fishing restrictions. In addition, marine monitoring programmes have been developed to monitor the extent of human impacts on the marine environment and the condition of marine waters.  
The national development plan Estonian Maritime Policy 2012-2020 presents guidelines uniting different sectors of the maritime field in order to promote maritime affairs and maximise Estonia’s potential for using and preserving its maritime resources. Among other aspects, the maritime policy also refers to issues related to maritime planning, which is the best instrument for balancing different fields of maritime utilisation, while simultaneously guaranteeing the protection of the maritime environment. 
According to the EU Maritime Planning Framework Directive, all member states are obliged to join the common EU maritime planning project by 2021. In recent years Estonia has been preparing maritime planning via different projects and the territorial sea planning of Hiiumaa and Pärnumaa. In autumn 2016 the planning of the whole maritime area of Estonia will be initiated. It will be done in cooperation with the other Baltic Sea countries, paying special attention to the preservation of the health of the ecosystems. 
In order to improve maritime control and increase the pollution response capacity, there are plans to acquire new multifunctional vessels that would be used by the border guard and maritime rescue personnel. These vessels would also be used for pollution response tasks and would be prepared for national defense functions. 
The measures will be implemented under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF). The development of sustainable fishing and aquaculture, collection and supervision of fishing data, development of coastal areas, improvement of processing and marketing of fishery products, and drafting of marine policy are supported within the framework of the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund for 2014-2020 operational programme, drawn up to mobilise the fund. Furthermore, the European Cohesion Fund is used to improve the condition of watercourses, for example, in order to improve the conditions for fish migration by facilitating passage over dams for salmon (creating so-called ‘fish ladders’). 
Basin management plans, programmes of measures for water management plans and flood risk management plans have been drawn up to improve the condition of rivers, lakes, coastal waters and seas, and to avoid floods. 
Every year, in order to ensure the sustainability of fishery resources and to avoid overfishing, the EU member states establish fishing quotas for the year in question on the Baltic Sea, organised by country and fish species. Estonia has started to collect electronic data on fishing, which allows officials to monitor the quota operationally. A national fishing farm that breeds and restocks bodies of water with protected fish or endangered cold-water juvenile fish contributes to recovering the stock of endangered fish species. 
An NGO, Estonian Fund for Nature, contributes to Baltic Sea protection with the operation Life Buoy, which brings together volunteers to clean up coastal pollution and help birds. The organisation also coordinated a maritime campaign in Estonia, titled Clean up the sea!, which is part of the global charity project AWARE (Aquatic World Awareness, Responsibility and Education).  
6.15 Goal 15. Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation, and stop biodiversity loss  
 
Estonia's goals and the situation in general  
 
Estonia’s natural landscape is very diverse, with coniferous and broad-leaf forests, coastal cliffs and dunes, sandy beaches and stony banks. Bogs, virgin forests, alvars and wooded meadows, which have almost disappeared elsewhere in Europe, have been preserved here. Approximately half of the land area in Estonia is covered by forest. Various wetlands make up about a tenth of the Estonian surface area. This provides habitats for a wide range of species. To preserve biodiversity and ensure favourable conditions for endangered species and habitats, a substantial part of Estonian territory has been taken under protection: 18.5% of its land and 27.4% of its maritime area. Twenty-five per cent (25%) of forest surface area has been placed under protection, and of that, 10% is under strict protection. 
To protect species and habitat types, the Natura 2000 network of protected areas was established by the Habitats Directive and Birds Directive. There are 60 habitat types in Estonia that have been listed in the European Union Habitats Directive, 51 animal and plant species listed in the II Annex, and 136 bird species listed in the Birds Directive, which are all protected by the designated special areas of conservation and protection, thus forming the Estonian Natura 2000 network. Fifty-two per cent (52%) of habitats and 54% of species are in favourable condition, while 45% and 27% respectively are in insufficient condition, 3% and 8% are in bad condition while the state of 11% of species is unknown. 
According to the Environmental Performance Index 2016, drawn up by scientists from Yale University, Columbia University and the World Economic Forum, Estonia is among the top 10 cleanest countries in the world, ranking 8th. The Index ranks 180 countries according to their performance in safeguarding ecosystems and protecting public health.  
With the action programme, the government aims to favour an active and sustainable management of forests while ensuring a sustainable and prudent management of state-owned forest. The strategic goals of the Nature Conservation Development Plan, approved by the government in 2012, are as follows: People are familiar with, appreciate and conserve nature and know how to use their knowledge in their daily lives; the favourable conservation status of species and habitats and diversity of landscapes is ensured and habitats are functioning as a coherent ecological network; the long-term sustainability of natural resources is ensured and the principles of the ecosystem approach are followed in the use of natural resources.

Measures and activities 
 
Apart from the traditional protection of species, nature conservation today focuses mostly on the preservation of habitat integrity and improving public awareness about the environment. As of 2015, Estonia had in total 3,894 protected natural objects: 931 protected areas; 343 areas of conservation; 1,386 permanent habitats; 20 protected natural objects at the local municipality level; and 1,214 individual protected natural objects. 
Five hundred seventy (570) plant, fungus and animal species have been placed under protection in Estonia. Species conservation action plans are being adopted to improve the condition of protected species and to plan and prioritise necessary activities for species survival. Conservation action plans for 58 species have been drawn up. For example, in the years 2012-2016, conservation action plans were adopted for the tundra swan, ringed seal, greater spotted eagle, Saaremaa yellow rattle, European common spadefoot, wood grouse, white-tailed eagle, Siberian flying squirrel, cypripedium calceolus, Eurasian eagle-owl, northern goshawk, golden eagle, osprey, and freshwater pearl mussel. To ensure favourable conditions for habitats, semi-natural habitats are restored and maintained, forest habitat protection is ensured, the natural states of rivers are reestablished (migration routes are opened, restoring spawning areas) and endangered mire habitats in protected areas are restored. An action plan for mires has been drawn up to maintain and restore the biodiversity of protected Estonian mires and ecosystem services (nature's benefits) and to plan associated measures for 2016-2020. A semi-natural habitats action plan has been drawn up to preserve the biodiversity of semi-natural communities and plan associated conservation measures for 2014-2020.  
The Estonian Environmental Board introduces and carries out nature conservation policy. The Estonian Environmental Agency collects and stores environmental information. The Environmental Investment Centre finances projects aimed at nature conservation and environmental education. The Estonian Environmental Inspectorate monitors the natural environment and the use of natural resources. According to the Estonian Nature Conservation Act, it is prohibited to introduce invasive species into the wild. Furthermore, the directive of the Minister of the Environment establishes a list of species (43) which are prohibited from being brought into Estonia for keeping as household pets or used for garden crops. The spread of invasive species can be prevented by raising public awareness of such species and deporting these species according to the relevant management plans (e.g. Cow Parsnip).  
The Estonian Forestry Development Plan 2020 aggregates measures to preserve the diversity of flora and fauna in forests and to use forests in a versatile and effective manner, including the aim to increase forest growth and carbon sequestration through timely reforestation.  
Estonia’s forested area has increased from 2.21 million hectares (2010) to 2.27 million hectares (2014). Estonian forest management follows the principles of sustainable forestry agreed upon within the framework of the Forest Europe process. By main function, managed forests make up 75%, protected forests 15% and strictly protected forests 10% of the total forest surface area. More and more forest owners manage forests through forest associations. By surface area, 30% of forest owners have become members of associations. The main prerequisite for forest management is the presence of actual data on the Estonian forest investments in the forest registry. The digital management possibilities of data related to forestry and the timber trade have been improved.  
Approximately 40% of Estonian forests are state-owned. These forests are tended, planted and managed by the State Forest Management Centre (RMK). The RMK is tasked with protecting and monitoring state forests, planting and growing new forest, forestry management and timber sales. Protected and recreational areas established by the RMK offer opportunities for hiking and leisure. Apart from that, the RMK grows forest plants and makes sure that Estonia has a sufficient forest seed stock.  
Among the NGOs dedicated to safeguarding Estonian nature and diversity are the Estonian Council of Environmental NGOs, Estonian Forest Society, Estonian Private Forest Association, Estonian Ornithological Society, etc. The Estonian Fund for Nature organises information and training activities related to seas, forests, wetlands and sustainable development on a wider scale. Since the 1980s, a cycling event called Roheliste rattaretk (Bicycle Trek for the Greens) has been organised in various areas in Estonia to introduce nature and tourist sites. It is a cycling trip lasting for several days with many participants, during which the Trekkers are given much information about the environment, geology, geography, cultural heritage, etc. The Nature Conservation Society Looduse Omnibuss (Nature Bus) organises nature tours and trips, helping to make being in the wild and getting to know it a natural part of the Estonian lifestyle. The Estonian Forest Society organises forest weeks, conferences, exhibitions and professional competitions to raise awareness of forestry and life in the forest. Hunters, of whom 85% are members of the Estonian Hunters' Society, control invasive non-native species.  
6.16 Goal 16. Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels  
 
Estonia's goals and the situation in general  
 
In order to reduce violence, the government aims to pay particular attention to reducing violence related to and directed towards minors; combating organised and serious hidden crime, including corruption, drug-related crime, economic crime causing major damage and human trafficking; and detecting and preventing (particularly repeated) domestic violence. The Strategy for Preventing and Reducing Violence - 2015-2020 addresses violence between children, child abuse, domestic abuse 
(violence within intimate relationships), sexual violence and human trafficking. The Estonian Internal Security Development Plan 2015-2020 covers combating crime (including combating organised crime), improving searches and seizures and the fight against terrorism. In 2016, The Estonian Government plans to ratify the Lanzarote Convention on protection of children against sexual exploitation and sexual abuse. 
In relation to combating corruption, Estonia has joined various international anti-corruption conventions: Convention on combating bribery of foreign public officials in international business transactions, the UN convention against corruption, and the Council of Europe Criminal Law Convention on Corruption. The aim of the Estonian Anti-Corruption Strategy 2013-2020 is to promote corruption awareness, improve transparency of decisions and actions, develop capabilities of investigative bodies and prevent corruption that could jeopardise national security. Another aim is to boost the confiscation of criminal assets and proceeds, in particular concerning the convictions relating to organised and serious economic crime and corruption. In the international anti-corruption organisation's Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index 2015, Estonia, with a score of 70, ranked 23-26 out of 168 countries, together with France, Chile and the UAE. With this indicator, Estonia outperforms other Eastern European countries. 
The Estonian Government considers it important to ensure legal certainty and strengthen and extend legal protection to people in need, and to facilitate their access to qualified state legal aid. Currently, the state offers legal aid in certain areas to vulnerable persons. The government has set a goal to reduce the number of recognised non-citizens.  
Estonia has followed the principles of openness and transparency in exercising its public powers by creating a relevant legal framework and using modern technological solutions in public administration. The principles of cooperation between the public authority and NGOs were agreed upon in 2002 and approved by the Parliament of Estonia within the conceptual framework of developing Estonian civil society, which aims for a society where national organisation is carried out by open and respectful cooperation between public authority and civil society. The Good Practice of Involvement commits ministries to involve NGOs into policymaking in the earliest stage possible and to give interest groups and the public sufficient time to express their opinions. Both the public sector and civil society itself can contribute to a better implementation of public engagement.  
Since the year 2012, Estonia has been a member of the Open Government Partnership (OGP), an international initiative by which the government has, alongside its NGO partners, called on the parliament and local municipalities to participate in order to strengthen open governance. The priorities of the Estonian OGP 2014-2016 action plan are increasing the openness of policy making processes, greater transparency of the state budget and financial resources use, and wider use of open data. In addition to development activities in the public sector, the capacity of the NGOs to increasingly participate in shaping public policy has also been supported.  
To offer better quality services and to keep the size of the public sector under control, the government has decided to carry out state reform which includes turning the work of local municipalities and the central government more efficient, focused and transparent. To strengthen the local municipalities and to better organise local life for people in Estonia, the government aims to implement administrative reform by 2017.

Measures and activities 
 
In order to prevent and reduce violence, the government will carry out measures within the framework of the Violence Prevention Strategy 2015-2020. The activities are related to informing and educating the general public. In the context of the strategy, focus will be placed on persons at risk of becoming a victim or committing an offence. The strategy also addresses the consequences of violence, providing support measures to victims and intervening against perpetrators. During the first year of its implementation, attention was mainly on primary prevention; thus, several information campaigns and events directed at the public were undertaken, and professionals working in the field were trained.  
In 2015 Estonia ratified The Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking Human Beings. Legislative amendments are in preparation to ensure the ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence. The amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure related to the transposition of the EU Victim's Rights Directive 2012/29/EU took effect in January 2016. With this step the victim's rights in criminal procedure were increased and a more victim-friendly procedure ensured. 
Measures against child-related violence are taken within the framework of a violence prevention strategy. There are separate activities provided in the Development Plan for Children and Families 2012-2020 to protect children’s rights, and more precisely, children’s rights and duties are defined in the Child Protection Act. The new Child Protection Act of Estonia entered into force in 2016, changing the organisation and principles of child protection. The State will advise municipalities with more complicated child protection cases, where the municipality lacks necessary knowledge or experience. The State will also provide support targeted to the child welfare professionals to increase their knowledge and skills. The Child Protection Act specifies that neglecting a child, subjecting a child to mental, emotional, physical and/or sexual abuse, including humiliation, intimidation and physical punishment, and punishing a child in any other way which threatens a child's mental, emotional or physical health, is forbidden. According to Estonian law, all childbirths must be registered in the first month of a child’s life on the basis of a parent’s application at the Vital Statistics Office.  
The Estonian Internal Security Development Plan 2015-2020 outlines the measures for combating serious and organised crime and terrorism. In the coming years, Estonia will further develop its performance in tackling crimes (search for persons, surveillance, detection of serious hidden crimes, forensics, international cooperation in criminal matters and shadow activities); establish and implement uniform service standards; develop capacities for criminal proceedings; implement the capacities needed for processing passenger name record data; ensure more efficient exchange of criminal intelligence and improve the interoperability and surveillance capacity of criminal intelligence systems; increase the authority to confiscate the proceeds of crime and combat economic crime; further develop international operational cooperation (INTERPOL, EUROPOL, FRONTEX); ensure smooth exchange of information and participation in joint operations, etc.  
The police organisation was reformed in order to increase the responsibility and responsiveness to community needs of the Police and Border Guard Board. The main services needed to serve the community, such as patrols, prevention and district work, and proceedings for offences committed in the community, were all brought together into local police departments. 
The rule of law and equal legal protection for everyone is provided by the Constitution of the Republic of Estonia. By the Constitution of the Republic of Estonia, everyone is entitled to protection by the government and the law. The law protects everyone from arbitrary exercises of governmental authority. It is the duty of the legislature, the executive, the judiciary and of local authorities, to guarantee rights and freedoms. In order to improve access to legal assistance, the government plans, in the short run, to review the basis for state legal aid, so that vulnerable members of society could receive legal assistance when needed. Ensuring access to free online legal assistance and increasing the availability of free judicial assistance will continue in the most common native languages in Estonia. By the Constitution of the Republic of Estonia, no one may be discriminated against on the basis of nationality, race, colour, sex, language, origin, religion, political or other views, property or social status, or on other grounds. Incitement to ethnic, racial, religious or political hatred, violence or discrimination is prohibited and punishable by law. 
Incitement to hatred and violence between social classes or to discrimination against a social class is also prohibited and punishable by law. 
The development plan for integration, Integrating Estonia 2020, is meant to reduce the number of people with undetermined citizenship and create equal opportunities for people with nationalities and native languages other than Estonian. For example, there are specific measures planned to create opportunities for increasing the social activity of less integrated permanent Estonian residents with foreign backgrounds, and to support integration and promote integration on a legal and political basis. To support naturalisation, projects addressing civic education that enhance the emergence of a homogeneous identity of the state and citizens, are undertaken and supported, and people without Estonian citizenship are informed about the rights and obligations of holding Estonian citizenship.  
One of the cornerstones of transparency in exercising public governance and authority is The Public Authority Act, which entered into force in 2001, ensuring wide access to public sector information and obliging the state to share information proactively. All of the public authorities are obliged to make practically all of the data regarding their work available on their webpage to the public, and everyone has the right in turn to request information. The state and local government databases are regarded as public information which can be shared on request.  
The decision-making process of both the government and the parliament has been open and online since the initiation of a draft until the publication of it in the state gazette "Riigi teataja", which also includes the consolidated versions of each law. The database for government-prepared draft legislation and the official procedure environment – The Electronic Coordination System for Draft Legislation (EIS) - is an e-environment accessible to everyone, where documents are coordinated between public authorities, forwarded, and presented at government sessions and public consultations. Interested parties can request that alerts on new drafts of their particular interest be added to the system, and they can therefore be informed on the proceedings and contents of the documents being processed. It is possible to give feedback online on drafts being prepared during the phase of public consultation and coordination. The best practices of inclusion, approved by the government, oblige the ministries to include NGOs in policymaking at the earliest stage possible, and to give interest groups and the public sufficient time to express their opinion. The system of impact assessment requires an impact analysis in the case of all legal acts and draft development plans that could potentially give rise to significant interest or have an important impact, and to inform the public of results during public discussion on the particular draft.  
The state databases are interfaced into a State information system X-Road, which allows the databases and registers to exchange information within their powers in a secure environment. More than 100 information systems interact through X-Road, which makes it possible to offer complete e-services to entrepreneurs, officials and citizens. For example, a citizen can verify their information in the population register, register for a state examination, apply for a European health insurance card, etc. Entrepreneurs can request information, forward insurance information to the Health Insurance Fund, verify business accounts at the Tax and Border Guard Board, etc.  
In order to strengthen municipalities and to make local life better organised for people in Estonia, the government will carry out state-wide reform by 2017. To ensure the quality and sustainability of services, there are major reforms being undertaken in the school system, healthcare system and social services. To ensure the quality and sustainability of services, there are major reforms being undertaken in the school system, healthcare system and social services. Various e-solutions contribute to the enhancement of services and their availability, as well as improving their userfriendliness and transparency. The number of government sector employees will be decreased, reflecting the corresponding decline in the working-age population, allowing the effectiveness and flexibility of the central government to increase. The number of government sector employees will be decreased, reflecting the corresponding decline in the working-age population, allowing the effectiveness and flexibility of the central government to increase. To achieve this, the administrative bureaucracy will be reduced, the public bodies that have similar tasks will have a common value chain and comprehensive sector-based management, and the centralisation of the state support services will be completed.  
At the international level, Estonia advocates the principle of rule of law as a member of the UN Economic and Social Council (2015-2017). The Estonian priorities at the UN Economic and Social Council are as follows: the protection of human rights, the rule of law and good governance, internet freedom, the rights of indigenous peoples and humanitarian issues. In the Development Cooperation and Humanitarian Aid Development Strategy 2016-2020 Estonia gives special attention to supporting of democracy, rule of law, good governance and human rights while participating in development cooperation.  
Most of the Estonian activities geared toward world security and peace-keeping are carried out through the international peace-keeping and post-conflict missions under the auspices of the EU and UN. In the years 2011-2015, Estonia contributed to the area of peace and security with 6 million EUR. During 2016-2020, Estonia will continue to send its experts on international civilian missions, the aims of which are to prevent or help solve crises, take part in international cooperation in clearing the areas of unexploded ordnance and landmines, the co-financing of the UN peacekeeping missions and cooperation with multilateral organisations to carry out the projects aiming to develop the police and legal systems in partner countries. Estonia also contributes to protecting women's rights in conflict situations, in accordance with the Estonian Action Plan for Implementing the UN Security Council Resolution 1325 Women, peace and security in Estonia in 2015-2019. 
Democracy, rule of law, good governance and human rights were the priority field to which Estonia contributed the most in 2011-2015, with 9 million EUR in total. At the same time, it is an area where Estonia is an attractive partner for developing countries due to its transition experience. Through the development of cooperation projects, assignment of experts and trainings, Estonia has supported its partner countries in modernising their government agencies, paying special attention to increasing the accessibility of ICT and its implementation in their government sector (e-governance), third sector and education system. Estonia has also supported its partner countries in strengthening their civil society and, in the case of the Eastern Partnership countries, carrying out the reforms under the EU association agreements.  
In 2016-2020, Estonia will continue similar bilateral cooperation with the partner countries, in particular in the field of e-governance  and ICT. The main prerequisite and tool to reduce poverty and improve the quality of life is respect for human rights. In the field of human rights protection, Estonia has successfully cooperated with the UN subsidiary organs, for example financing the 
Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights through voluntary contributions, the UN Office of the Special representative of the Secretary General for Sexual Violence in Conflict, UNDP and, in cooperation with UNICEF, contributed to better safeguarding children’s rights and needs. 
Multilateral organisations dealing with the development of human rights, democracy, good governance and the rule of law will also be supported during the period 2016-2020. 
Several civil society organisations contribute to violence prevention, combating corruption, protecting child rights and developing relevant policies. The following civil society organisations are partners to the government in violence prevention: The Estonian Women's Shelters Union, the Estonian Women's Association Roundtable, Estonian Women's Shelters Council, the Human Rights 
Centre, Institute of Human Rights, the Crime Prevention Foundation, the non-profit association the Estonian institute for Open Society, the Freedom from Bullying Foundation, MTÜ Ühendus Emade ja Laste Kaitseks (a non-profit association for the protection of mothers and children), MTÜ Living for Tomorrow, MTÜ Meeste Kriisikeskus (Crisis Centre for Men), Eesti Õpetajate Liit (Estonian Union for Teachers) and The Estonian Union for Child Welfare. The last, the Estonian Union for Child Welfare, has been focusing on the protection of children’s rights and creating a childfriendlier society since 1988. Thanks to the Norwegian and EEA financial mechanism, the nonprofit associations' capacities to contribute to violence prevention has improved. With the help of civil society organisations, several guidance documents have been prepared, trainings have been organised and effort has been put into primary prevention.  
Transparency International Estonia aims to draw society's attention to corruption in the public and private sector. To ensure better structural corruption prevention, anti-corruption policy and laws are being constantly analysed, monitored and influenced by proposals. Raising awareness of corruption is also considered important. 
The Estonian Human Rights Centre is an independent non-governmental human rights advocacy organisation, focusing on the advancement of equal treatment, diversity, and the human rights of asylum seekers and refugees. The Centre monitors the general state of human rights in Estonia and has been publishing human rights reports on Estonia since 2007. The centre also coordinates the Estonian Diversity Charter12.  
6.17 Goal 17. Strengthen the implementation measures for the Action Plan and revitalise the global partnership for sustainable development.  
 
Estonia's goals and the situation in general  
 
The government Action Plan 2015-2019 aims at actively protecting and promoting liberal fundamental values – freedoms, democracy and human rights – in Estonia, the European Union and beyond the EU's borders by carrying out bilateral and unilateral development cooperation projects. In order to decrease inequality between countries, the aim of the government is to foster diplomatic, economic and cultural relations with other countries, provide development aid and engage in development cooperation with partner countries, if it serves the national interests of 
Estonia. The government Action Plan 2015-2019 aims at keeping the development cooperation and humanitarian assistance budget share of the gross national income (GNI) at least at the level of 2015 (0,15%). 
The Strategy for Development Cooperation and Humanitarian Aid 2016-2020 aims at increasing the official development assistance share of GNI in accordance to the state budget, if possible, by raising it up to 0.33% by 2030. During the years 2004-2014 the share of Estonia's development aid from our GNI has increased considerably: when in 2004 the respective share was 0.02% of the GNI then in 2015 the share had increased to 0.15% of the GNI. 
In accordance with the Estonian development cooperation principles, approved by the Parliament, Estonian development cooperation is addressing topics such as peace, democracy, and respect for human rights, economic and social stability and the reduction of global poverty in line with the internationally-approved sustainable development principles.

Measures and activities 
 
Estonia has been systematically involved in development cooperation by providing development assistance to developing countries since 1998. During that time, development cooperation and humanitarian aid have become a natural part of Estonian foreign policy. The basis for the current Estonian Development Cooperation and Humanitarian Aid Development Strategy 2016-2020 are general international agreements and goals such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the agreements on funding, as well as the European Union decisions and guidelines on development policy.  
One of the foundations of the Estonian development coordination policy’s productiveness is the targeted activity in international organisations, where Estonia, regardless of being a small country, can, by active participation, have an important influence on international development and humanitarian aid policy-making. Considering Estonia’s limited resources and diplomatic presence, its financial contribution to the work of international agencies is the most effective way of contributing into supporting the poorest and most vulnerable countries in the areas of development cooperation and humanitarian aid. 
In development cooperation, Estonia aims at contributing to the eradication of poverty globally and at achieving its Sustainable Development Goals. The development cooperation goals for Estonia in 2016-2020 by areas are as follows: 1) to support quality education; 2) to support the development of health care; 3) to consolidate peace and security; 4) to support the development of democracy, implement good governance and safeguard human rights; 5) to promote economic development; 6) to support environmentally-sustainable development; 7) to raise the awareness of the public, especially of young people, about development cooperation, humanitarian aid and global development issues. 
The main priority countries according to the current Estonian Development Cooperation and Humanitarian Aid Development Strategy are Georgia, Ukraine, Moldova, Afghanistan and Belarus. Another aim of the Development Strategy is to contribute greater instruments of development cooperation to vulnerable states and continue to react flexibly to the needs of less developed and post-conflict countries, developing island states and landlocked developing countries in the areas where Estonia has a clear added value to offer. In the case of such cooperation, regions in CentralAsia, Africa and the Middle-East are preferred. It is planned to raise the proportion of development cooperation provided to these countries by 2020 and on average by 9% from the Development Cooperation Budget of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (considering the current budget that would be one million EUR or 0.01% of the GNI). In 2015 Estonia contributed to less-developed countries with 6% of the ODA. 
Among the less-developed countries, one of the most important target countries in the Estonian bilateral development cooperation since 2006 has been Afghanistan, where Estonia has contributed through cooperation with international organisations and bilateral cooperation. The Estonian special mission to Kabul between 2006 and 2014 took part in this, for example. The Estonian development cooperation in Afghanistan focuses on the areas of security, education and improving the situation of women and girls. Considering the Estonia’s long-term international obligations in Afghanistan, the cooperation will continue between 2016 and 2020 with the assistance of international organisations and on a bilateral basis, depending on the security situation and local opportunities. The inaccessibility to education and medical care and the situation of girls and women remains a major problem. The indicators for the living standards in Afghanistan are one of the lowest in the world; a large proportion of the population suffers from the absence of housing, clean water, electricity, health care services and unemployment.  
Estonia is actively shaping the development policy of the EU, which is the world's largest donor of development cooperation and humanitarian aid, by participating in the discussions on the topical issues of the Development Cooperation Working Group and by drawing up policy documents in line with the Estonian priorities and political interests. The main areas are: policy coherence, aid effectiveness, gender equality, mainstreaming the ICT, connecting development coordination and humanitarian aid better in the case of conflicts and forced mass migration. Estonia makes payments to the EU budget, through which are financed the development cooperation instruments for assistance programmes and funds aimed at the poorest and most vulnerable states. Estonia considers it essential to connect the EU humanitarian aid with the policies of civil protection and development cooperation and supports the EU member states' unified response and coordination to crises through the EU civil protection mechanism. The Estonian presidency of the Council of the EU in the first half of 2018 provides additional opportunities to shape the EU policy on development cooperation and humanitarian aid. 
To ensure the effectiveness of the Estonian development cooperation policy and help achieve the SDGs, we need to take into account the positive and negative impact to the poorest countries when expressing our views in each policy area. In order to better connect other policy areas with the goals of development cooperation during the period of 2016-2020, we will map the coherence of other policy areas with the development cooperation goals by 2017, increase awareness among decision makers in the key areas of policy coherence and of the goals of development cooperation. The initial framework for the Estonian policy coherence will be established by 2020 in cooperation with our strategic partners. 
The Estonian trade policy is connected to the EU policies. According to the Estonian EU Policy 2015-2019, the Estonian trade policy values the following: 1) The commitment of the EU to developing a liberal global trade policy, preserving a strong multilateral trade system and eradicating global poverty, and to continue with bilateral free trade and investment protection agreements with important trade partners; 2) the successfully conclusion of the WTO Doha Development Agenda; 3) the EU preparations to revise the Cotonou agreement regulating the relations with countries from Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific by 2019, while taking into account the developments in international environment and partner countries in the past 15 years. 
Estonian multilateral cooperation is based on partnerships with various international organisations of development cooperation and humanitarian aid groups and the following UN agencies: UNICEF, 
UNDP, UNWOMEN, UNFPA, WTO, UNHCR, WFP, ICRC, WHO, and others. In addition Estonia participates in multi-lateral funding and other international charities: Endowment for Democracy, ICC, EBRD/E5P Fund, the Madad Fund, the Turkey Facility, Lifeline Fund, etc.  
Several NGOs in Estonia, being under an umbrella organisation The Estonian Roundtable for development Cooperation (as a non-profit organisation), contribute to the enhancement of development cooperation, humanitarian aid and promoting global education.  
 	 
7. NEXT STEPS  
 
The first activities for Agenda 2030 have already been initiated while drawing up the current review. An initial comparative analysis of the goals of Agenda 2030 and of Estonian government policy has been carried out, and gives an overview of the UN Sustainable Development Goals that have been addressed by the government. Estonian Sustainable Development Commission has initiated an analysis to evaluate the timeliness and appropriateness of the Estonian National Strategy for Sustainable Development: Sustainable Estonia 21, in the light of new trends and the global Agenda 2030. The analysis will be concluded in the autumn 2016. Its results will be taken into account when proposals are made concerning renewing the national sustainable development strategy and/or implementation mechanisms.  
The list of the Estonian indicators for sustainable development will be updated in the second half of 2016 to reflect the goals and indicators of Agenda 2030. The indicators will be updated in cooperation with Statistics Estonia, the Government Office, the inter-ministerial working group on sustainable development and the Estonian Commission on Sustainable Development. Monitoring reports based on new indicators should enable an assessment evaluating Estonia’s progress in achieving the national and global Sustainable Development Goals.  
Estonia must continue contributing to fostering innovative technological solutions that help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. For example, by developing digital technologies and e-government, Estonia has improved its economic development, good governance, transparency, resource efficiency and human development. The government continues its sectoral activities in connection with the main challenges that have been identified in the analysis. It is important to find efficient solutions to raise public awareness of Agenda 2030 and to contribute to achieve the goals through international cooperation.   
8. CONCLUDING REMARKS 
 
The results from the comparative analysis, which was carried out while drawing up the report on government policies and Agenda 2030, and from mapping the measures and activities, indicate that the Estonian government and the non-governmental sector already implement the measures and plan the activities related to all 17 areas of the global Sustainable Development Goals. Several goals are completely and some partially achieved by the government’s lines of action. The strengths of Estonia are: a good level of biodiversity conservation; a high proportion of renewable energy in the energy sector, and in particular in the heating sector; the government's open and inclusive legislative process; prompt and convenient accessibility to public sector services through e-services; and the availability of quality education. The analysis brought out the areas where the Estonian government has to continue with further efforts in order to achieve global Sustainable Development Goals and the relevant national goals which are set out by the government. These are, for example, increasing productivity, reducing the economy's energy and carbon intensity, the eradication of poverty and reducing the pay gap. 
As the declaration Transforming our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which was adopted in September 2015, sets out that achieving the global goals requires a contribution from both the government and the NGO sector, including municipalities, local and international organisations, the academy, charities, volunteer organisations, etc. It is important to include them in the work of the government and raise the awareness of Agenda 2030 goals in general and on how to contribute to carrying them out.  
Estonia, as a small country, is nevertheless connected to the world, and a failure in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals or underperformance in the process would not only result in a drop in public well-being and degradation of the natural environment, but would also be a significant security risk. By achieving the 17 Sustainable Development Goals adopted by the UN, the roots of various conflicts will be decreased and there will be conditions created for sustainable human existence and development. Therefore, it is extremely important for Estonia to achieve these global Sustainable Development Goals, which also means that Estonia will make every effort to implement Agenda 2030.
