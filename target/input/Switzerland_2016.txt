Summary 
The Swiss Confederation considers the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development a unique opportunity to strengthen and to boost sustainable development at all levels: global, regional, national, and subnational. It therefore took an active role in the international process from 2013 to 2015 to draw up the universal Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the means of implementation and financing framework (Addis Ababa Action Agenda), as well as an effective follow-up and review system. Other Swiss key concerns in the negotiation process were, and will remain for the future, that the new goals integrate the social, economic and environmental dimensions in a balanced manner and take account of the interlinkages between them. 
High commitment at all levels
The Swiss Federal Council decided in December 2015 to keep this high level of engagement and contribute in a meaningful way to implementing the 2030 Agenda – both in domestic and foreign policy. In January 2016 the Federal Council adopted the Sustainable Development Strategy (SDS) 2016–2019 that underlines the need for sustainable development to be a coherent feature of all policy areas. Consequently and wherever possible, Switzerland’s international engagement, in particular its future international cooperation as well as sectoral foreign policies, will also be oriented towards the SDGs. 
Immediate action to kick-start implementation
Within a “transition phase” from 2016 to 2017, a comprehensive programme of work is being put into practice. This work is managed by a temporary inter-ministerial working group with the aim to: 
» clarify institutional arrangements, processes and responsibilities in the Federal Administration for the effective implementation and follow-up of the 2030 Agenda; 
» conduct a baseline study as well as a gap analysis covering all SDGs and targets to identify and define future areas of action to implement the 
2030 Agenda; 
» ensure adequate monitoring and reporting by expanding the Swiss system of sustainable development indicators as appropriate. 
By early 2018, a report summarising these and other efforts as well as formulating respective recommendations for Swiss implementation of the 2030 Agenda will be presented to the Federal Council. Based on the findings from the transition phase and decisions taken by the Federal Council, Switzerland will present a first comprehensive country review at the HLPF 2018.
Creating ownership and increasing policy coherence
In a decentralised country such as Switzerland, subnational authorities, i.e. the cantons and communes, fulfill an important role. It is, therefore, a key concern for the Swiss Confederation to factor sustainable development principles into all levels of government in order to create and increase ownership. Sustainable development should not be regarded as an additional government task, but rather be integrated as far as possible into regular planning and control processes. In the context of the 2030 Agenda implementation, great importance is attached to vertical cooperation between the Confederation, cantons and communes, as well as to strengthening policy coherence for sustainable development at all levels. 
Switzerland has a long tradition of conducting political processes based on stakeholder participation for the coordination of both national and international policies. Previous participatory processes in the context of sustainable development have been consolidated since autumn 2015. A new and comprehensive consultation procedure (the “2030 Dialogue on Sustainable Development”) has resulted that will ensure that the outcomes of the stakeholder dialogue continue to provide input, and that all relevant stakeholder groups are involved in ongoing processes linked to the Confederation’s sustainable development policy cycle of planning, implementing, monitoring, evaluating and reporting. 
Sustainable Development Strategy 2016–2019
The following guidelines, as part of the Sustainable Development Strategy 2016–2019, explain how the Swiss Confederation intends to integrate sustainability policy into all of its sectoral policies: » Take responsibility for the future
» Balanced consideration of the three dimensions of sustainable development » Incorporate sustainable development into all policy areas
» Improve coherence and coordination between policy areas
» Forge sustainable development partnerships
The 2030 Agenda provides a framework for addressing key challenges all countries must overcome in a way appropriate to their particular circumstances. In this spirit, the Sustainable Development Strategy 2016–2019 consists of a concrete action plan, structured into the following nine thematic areas of action in the priority fields for sustainable development, including its global dimensions and the interplay of Switzerland and other countries. These priorities are based on the general focus areas of overall federal government policy, on the objectives determined by the 2030 Agenda, as well as on the outcomes of the stakeholder dialogue: 
» Consumption and production (SDG 12) » Urban development, mobility and infrastructure 
(SDGs 9 and 11)
» Energy and climate (SDGs 7 and 13)
» Natural resources (SDGs 2, 6, 14, and 15) » Economic and financial system (SDGs 8, 10, 16, and 17)
» Education, research and innovation (SDG 4)
» Social security (SDGs 1 and 16) » Social cohesion and gender equality (SDGs 5, 
10, and 16)
» Health (SDG 3)
Swiss foreign policy 
The Sustainable Development Strategy 2016–2019 also lists selected foreign policy activities. Switzerland is strongly committed to sustainable development through its foreign policy, including its foreign economic policy, international cooperation, and sectoral foreign policies. With its engagement in international processes geared towards specific sectors (including multilateral conventions, bilateral agreements, as well as regional and global (UN) programmes), Switzerland contributes to the advancement of sustainable development in its three dimensions. The new Swiss Foreign Policy Strategy 2016–2019 defines the broad outlines of Switzerland’s international commitment for the legislative period until 2019. Sustainable development forms one of the four key priorities of the strategy.
The 2030 Agenda and the SDGs will form an integral part of Switzerland’s international cooperation efforts in the future. Through its Dispatch on International Cooperation 2017–2020, which is currently under deliberation in Parliament, the Federal Council applies for framework financing facilities and determines the instruments that will be used to implement the SDGs as part of Switzerland’s international cooperation activities. In the period from 2017 to 2020, Switzerland will focus its efforts on the following seven objectives in order to strengthen its contribution to achieving the respective SDGs and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda: » Contribute to the development of an international framework for responding to global challenges 
» Prevent and manage the consequences of crisis and disaster, and of fragility; promote conflict transformation
» Support sustainable access to resources and services for all
» Promote sustainable economic growth » Strengthen the rule of law and democratic participation; support institutions serving society and the economy 
» Ensure respect for human rights and fundamental liberties, and support efforts to advance their cause
» Strengthen gender equality and the rights of women and girls.
Institutional transition towards effective implementation and follow-up
During the 2016–17 transition phase, the alignment of Swiss sustainability policy with the 2030 Agenda will be further developed. Questions relating to institutional arrangements will be examined and modifications proposed where necessary. Particular attention will be paid to coordinating national, subnational and international processes as effectively as possible. Building on existing structures, the aim is to arrive at an efficient process within the Swiss Confederation to implement the 2030 Agenda in both domestic and foreign policy. Synergies should be created between national and international processes, while avoiding duplication and overlaps. Initial work will also be done on what exactly implementation of the SDGs will entail. Federal offices are required to include sustainable development in their own periodic reports on items of business or areas covered by their sectoral policies. In order to measure and report on contributions to the SDGs, Switzerland uses its comprehensive sustainable development monitoring system (MONET) in place since 2003. With its approximately 75 regularly updated indicators it is observed whether, as well as in what context and areas, Switzerland is on the path to sustainable development. In May 2016, the system’s reference framework was amended in order to be ready to take into account the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs, thus laying the foundation for both national and international reporting. 
The Confederation is also committed to actively engaging in the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) alongside all other countries and all relevant stakeholder representatives. Accordingly, it will participate in the planned periodic reporting and implementation monitoring for the SDGs, provide specific input on how the basis of data can be improved, and help developing countries to build their national capacities to draft strategies for sustainable development and to track their implementation. 
Means of Implementation 
The implementation of the Sustainable Development Strategy 2016–2019 is funded via the budgets that have been approved for the individual federal offices, which are responsible for incorporating the necessary financial resources into their financial planning. The Swiss Confederation also supports the comprehensive financing and implementation framework adopted by all UN member states at the Third International Conference on Financing for Development: the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA). Moreover, Switzerland is highly engaged in support of international conventions and standards in order to strengthen the normative global framework favouring the achievement of the SDGs.
The Swiss Confederation strives to address the multiple challenges posed by the adaptation of the SDGs to Switzerland’s national context. Accordingly, it will initiate and foster implementation partnerships in all areas and at all levels. Close cooperation between government, interested associations and non-governmental organisations – primarily from the environmental, development cooperation, business and social spheres – has been developed on a regular basis for many years. This coordinated approach between the various areas and actors will be further consolidated in order to engage broader-based partnerships and multi-stakeholder initiatives to complement Switzerland’s significant share to the transformation of our world towards sustainable development by 2030. 
Introduction
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2030 Agenda) adopted by the UN Member States on 25 September is at the top of Switzerland’s priority list with regard to sustainable development. Switzerland was actively involved in drawing up the universally applicable goals, the financing framework and an effective monitoring and review system. Already at an early stage, in the process leading up to the decision taken at the Rio+20 Conference to develop SDGs, Switzerland was highly engaged. In the aftermath of the Rio+20 Conference in 2012, it co-led two global thematic consultations by the UN Development Group on water and on population dynamics. Subsequently, Switzerland became a member of the Open Working Group on SDGs, sharing a seat with France and Germany.
Among Switzerland’s key concerns in the negotiation process was that the new goals should integrate the social, economic and environmental dimensions in a balanced manner and take account of the interlinkages between the goals. From the beginning, Switzerland worked very hard for the creation of an effective intergovernmental monitoring and review framework which should make it possible to review progress and to exchange experiences on how to implement the SDGs. Switzerland was also a key proponent for the decision taken at the Rio+20 conference to establish the HLPF.
Switzerland will remain highly engaged and contribute in a meaningful way to implementing the 2030 Agenda for the entire duration of the process – both in its domestic and foreign policies, including its international cooperation and all relevant sector policies. Sustainable development needs to be a coherent feature of all policy areas and is enshrined in the Swiss Constitution in a number of places (see p. 11). 
While Switzerland’s future international cooperation will be oriented towards the SDGs, the core instrument for Switzerland’s national implementation is the Sustainable Development Strategy (SDS) which was renewed in January 2016. The SDS describes the contribution Switzerland will make to implementing the 2030 Agenda and to achieving the SDGs, while setting out the Federal Council’s policy priorities for sustainable development in the medium to long term. The aim in the future is to align the strategy as comprehensively as possible with the 2030 Agenda to ensure that Switzerland plays a full part in achieving the SDGs by 2030.
With this report, the Swiss Confederation presents its first steps towards the implementation of the 2030 Agenda.

Methodology and process for preparation of the reviewOn 18 December 2015, the Swiss Federal Council decided on the initial steps to be taken for Switzerland’s implementation of the 2030 Agenda. With the decision by the Federal Council, the Federal Administration was tasked with making immediate provisions for a report on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs, identifying areas where action is needed and providing recommendations on concrete measures. The implementation of the 2030 Agenda in and by Switzerland shall be based on existing instruments and strategies, such as: 
» The Sustainable Development Strategy » The Swiss sustainable development monitoring system (MONET)
» Swiss international cooperation, including humanitarian aid, development cooperation, transition assistance, economic development, and human security 
» Sectoral national and international strategies and policies, including multilateral conventions, bilateral agreements, as well as regional and global (UN) institutions
The SDS is the principal instrument for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda in Switzerland. Switzerland’s government has set out its political intentions with regard to sustainable development in this strategy since 1997. The strategy is therefore fully integrated into the Federal Council’s legislative planning, thus linking the content and procedures of both planning processes even more closely. The SDS is geared to a medium- to long-term horizon and defines key strategic action on the implementation of currently applicable law. 
During the 2016–17 transition phase a comprehensive programme of work will be put into practice (see p. 11). This work is being managed by a temporary inter-ministerial working group (see p. 18). In March 2016, the working group endorsed a joint programme of work, for which the competent federal offices provide the necessary funding and resources. 
The inter-ministerial working group drafted the present report on Switzerland’s initial steps to implement the 2030 Agenda. The report was discussed within the participatory consultation mechanisms already established within the Federal Administration for prior purposes in this context. In general, the implementation and follow-up processes launched after the adoption of the 2030 Agenda in September 2015 are built on existing mechanisms for coordination and stakeholder participation. 

Policy and enabling environment Creating ownership of the 
Sustainable Development Goals
Implementing sustainable development policy is a demanding, long-term process. Creating broad ownership requires close and well-coordinated cooperation between all levels of government and with representatives from all stakeholder groups, including the private sector, civil society, academia and politics. Switzerland has a long tradition in conducting political processes with stakeholder participation, for the coordination of both national and international policies. Within the federal government, the coordination has always been assured with a Whole of Government Approach established at administration level which also translates at a political level in all international sustainable development processes. Close coordination between the involved departments is an expression of Switzerland’s strong leadership for sustainable development. 
Stakeholder involvement 
In the period from 2012 to 2015, Swiss stakeholders were involved in two parallel public dialogues – one on Switzerland’s engagement regarding the 2030 Agenda, led by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) through an inter-ministerial task force, the other regarding the new SDS, led by the Federal Office for Spatial Development (ARE) and through the Interdepartmental Sustainable Development Committee (ISDC). The stakeholders’ interests, points of view and objectives with regard to sustainable development were considered and discussed. Both processes encompassed representatives of civil society, business, academia, politics and the Federal Administration, while the SDS, because of its national focus, was additionally consulted with the cantons. 
Stakeholder feedback through these consultations was integrated into Switzerland’s position on engagement regarding the 2030 Agenda. The Swiss position paper was adopted by the Federal Council in June 2014 and resulted in a negotiation mandate for the Swiss delegation in the intergovernmental negotiations on the 2030 Agenda and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda in 2015. 
The dialogue with institutional stakeholder groups from business, civil society, academia and politics regarding the new SDS provided proposals for a long-term vision and the targets which should be met by 2030 (oriented towards the SDGs) as well as the identification of actions that the Confederation should take in the 2016–2019 period to achieve its medium-term targets. The outcomes of this dialogue were collated into a synthesis report which served as one of the bases for the new strategy. The work to revise the SDS also involved closer cooperation with the cantons and communes. They were included in the process of developing the strategy as part of the broad stakeholder dialogue. For the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, however, the subnational level will have to be involved even closer. 
These processes have been consolidated since autumn 2015, resulting in a new and comprehensive consultation procedure, the “2030 Dialogue on Sustainable Development”. It will ensure that the outcomes of the stakeholder dialogue continue to provide input and that all relevant stakeholder groups are involved in ongoing processes linked to the Confederation’s sustainable development policy cycle of monitoring, planning, implementation, evaluation and reporting. In the 2016–17 transition phase it will be determined in which way Swiss stakeholders will get involved, in particular in the process of drafting a first substantive voluntary national report to be presented at the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) in 2018.
 
Creating ownership, strengthening policy coherence
Integrating sustainable development principles into all levels of government is a key concern for the Confederation in creating and increasing ownership. Vertical cooperation between the Confederation, cantons and communes is therefore important in a decentralised country such as Switzerland. The cantons and communes are called upon to do their part to implement the 2030 Agenda. In the past, many cantons and communes have already used the Federal Council’s Sustainable Development Strategy as a reference framework for their own activities. In the context of 2030 Agenda implementation, decision-makers at all levels of government are asked to enhance their engagement and to launch relevant initiatives. Sustainable development should not be regarded as an additional government task, but as a means to increasing ownership and policy coherence and should be integrated as far as possible into sectoral policies and normal planning and control processes.
At the same time, existing mechanisms for fostering policy coherence for sustainable development at the federal level will be strengthened. The preparation of Federal Council decisions in consultation with various offices or in inter-ministerial working groups on specific topics is central to ensuring policy coherence at the federal level. These consultation and coordination processes examine the Confederation’s initiatives in specific sectors to ensure that they are congruent with sustainable development. The task here is to make greater use of synergies between different policies and to mitigate any conflicting aims and negative side effects. The research and groundwork that is required to set up an observation system for the various aspects of foreign policy, and the relevant monitoring instruments, is currently under way.
Incorporation of the SDGs in the national framework
Sustainable development is enshrined in the Federal Constitution of 1999 in a number of places.1 Every four years, the Federal Council submits a dispatch to Parliament setting out its planned programme of legislation for the coming period. Legislative planning and the SDS are thus closely linked from both the content and procedural perspectives. 
Although the 2030 Agenda is not legally binding, by adopting it all states declared their willingness to work together to achieve the SDGs by 2030, to adopt them as a reference framework for their national strategies and planning processes, and to make an appropriate contribution to their implementation at national and international level. The Swiss Confederation takes this very seriously and is highly committed to its implementation. One of the ways in which this will happen at the domestic level is through the specific targets defined in the SDS which refer to SDG targets.
Sustainability guidelines
 
Switzerland’s guidelines on sustainability policy, as part of the SDS 2016–2019, explain how the Federal Council intends to mainstream sustainable development in all of the Confederation’s sectoral policies. They are based on the Federal Constitution and on key reference documents issued by the United Nations and other international organisations. The following guidelines apply to sustainable development policy. 
» Take responsibility for the future: According to the principle of common yet shared responsibilities, the highly developed industrialised countries must lead the way with regard to accountability for past and present development processes and in view of their greater financial and technical resources. Responsibility for the future means promoting the principles of prevention, “producer pays” and liability as the essential framework for sustainable, long-term economic, environmental and social action at all levels. 
» Balanced consideration of the three dimensions of sustainable development: When developing federal policy, equal account must be taken of the three complementary dimensions of economy, social development and environment. The “capital stock” model provides an additional basis for this. A limited degree of substitution is possible between the different capital stocks, although certain limiting criteria such as minimum social, economic and environmental requirements must be observed. 
» Incorporate sustainable development into all areas of policy: Sustainable development is not an additional sectoral policy in itself, but an overarching regulatory concept to which all areas of policy are to be aligned. Sustainable development is a government objective stipulated in the Federal Constitution and thus a binding task for all state authorities. It must be integrated from the start in existing planning and control processes of the Federal Council, the departments and offices of the Federal Administration. » Improve coherence and coordination between policy areas: The various sectoral policies must form a coherent whole on both the domestic and foreign policy fronts. Important policy decisions must be based on proposals whose economic, social and environmental impacts are evaluated transparently at an early stage in order to optimise state action. Here, any conflicts with regard to content must be disclosed, and the way in which interests have been considered must be shown transparently. 
» Forge sustainable development partnerships: Many of the problems our country is facing can only be resolved constructively when all three levels of government work closely together. Switzerland’s structure as a federal state means that cantonal and communal administrations have far-reaching power and influence in many areas of relevance to sustainability. In the future, civil society and the private sector are also to be involved as much as possible in shaping and implementing sustainable development policy.
2016–2017 transition phase: Programme of work
The Federal Council’s aim is to align its SDS, foreign policy, including international cooperation, and all relevant sector policies as comprehensively as possible with the 2030 Agenda in order to secure Switzerland’s contribution to achieving the SDGs by 2030. Following a decision by the Federal Council in December 2015, therefore, initial steps are being taken to implement the 2030 Agenda. During the 2016–2017 transition phase, the following programme of work will be put into practice, inter alia: 
» Baseline study on the extent to which Switzerland already contributes to the achievement of the SDGs, primarily in sectoral policies, combined with a gap analysis to identify and define future areas of action to implement the 2030 Agenda; 
» Clarification of arrangements and transfer of responsibilities regarding the individual SDGs to the federal offices in charge of relevant sectoral policies; 
» Determination of the future process and internal structure within the Federal Administration needed to implement the 2030 Agenda with the aim of taking on responsibility for the longterm implementation of the SDGs and targets in sectoral processes; 
» Alignment of reporting to UN requirements, preparation of Switzerland’s first substantive report to the HLPF in 2018; » Expansion of the sustainable development monitoring system MONET to ensure adequate monitoring and reporting; » Determination of the modalities for stakeholder participation in consultations as well as in implementation partnerships for the 2030 Agenda. 
By early 2018, a report summarising these efforts and formulating relevant recommendations for Switzerland’s implementation of the 2030 Agenda will be presented to the Federal Council. Based on the findings from the transition phase and decisions taken by the Federal Council, Switzerland will present a first comprehensive country review at the HLPF 2018. 
Integration of the three dimensions of sustainable development
The SDGs are embedded in a narrative of transformative change, which is needed to realise a common vision of ending poverty in all its forms, of promoting social inclusion and universal human development that respects human dignity, human rights and planetary boundaries. The SDGs apply to all countries equally. Economic, social and environmental aspects are taken into account in a balanced way and themes such as peaceful societies, the rule of law and governance, which are fundamental to sustainable development, are also addressed. 
In building on the 2030 Agenda, respective measures and activities should address the issue of integrating its three complementary dimensions of economy, environment and social development. The Swiss Confederation is taking steps to integrate the three dimensions of sustainable development in all relevant policies and strategies in a balanced way, both at the domestic and international level. 
The following examples illustrate Switzerland’s commitment in this regard:

I 	HEALTH 2020
Health2020 is an overview of the priorities set by the Federal Council on 23 January 2013 in the field of health policy in Switzerland for the coming eight years. 
People in Switzerland enjoy the benefits of a good healthcare system. The strengths of the system include guaranteed access to healthcare, the broad spectrum of benefits and services covered by the statutory health-insurance system (SHI), and the high quality of care provided. This guarantees the people who live in this country a high quality of life and a life expectancy which is well above average. 
However, the present system also has weaknesses: its transparency is limited; there is no targeted management; the statistical and analytical basis is incomplete; and there are perverse incentives which give rise to inefficiencies and unnecessary costs. Furthermore, Switzerland invests too little in prevention and in early detection of diseases. 
In the coming years the Swiss health system will also be confronted with additional challenges: the incidence of chronic diseases will increase; the way healthcare is delivered will have to change; the financial basis of the continually growing health sector must be safeguarded; and the lack of manageability and transparency must be eliminated. 
A strategy with broad political support is therefore required to consolidate what has been achieved, to eliminate once and for all the weaknesses in the health system and to overcome the challenges. Health2020 defines the following four overriding priorities for policy action: ensure quality of life; reinforce equality of opportunity and individual responsibility, safeguard and increase the quality of healthcare provision; and create transparency, better control and coordination, comprising twelve objectives, each with three activities – a total of 36 activities in all. They complement the activities already ongoing in the healthcare system.
One of the main areas of action in 2016 will be the implementation of “Health in all Policies”. Factors outside the public health domain influence to an extent higher than 50% the health of the Swiss population. Thus the focus will be to define and realise specific procedures together with other federal offices in the domains of environment and energy, economy and social policy – thus contributing to all three dimensions of sustainable development and several SDGs at the same time (SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 16, 17).

II 	MORE COFFEE WITH LESS WATER – TOWARDS A REDUCTION OF THE 
WATER FOOTPRINT IN 
COFFEE PRODUCTION
Intensified coffee production in Vietnam – the second-largest coffee producer in the world – has resulted in declining water availability due to the overuse and mismanagement of water. Building on earlier successes, this public-private partnership (PPP) between Switzerland and Nestlé commits to scaling up water-saving practices in the Vietnamese coffee sector. In line with the vision of the Coffee Coordinating Board, headed by the Vietnamese Ministry of Agriculture, water management in agriculture is brought to the agenda through a pragmatic PPP showcase at implementation level. The project demonstrates how to integrate the three dimensions of sustainable development into a multi-stakeholder partnership contributing to several SDGs at the same time (SDGs 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 12, 15, and 17). 
The overall goal of this project is to ensure equitable and sufficient water availability for all water users in the Central Highlands of Vietnam and to obtain pivotal water savings through improved irrigation management in the coffee sector. The project also aims to reach out to a critical mass of farmers and hence to improve people’s livelihoods in socio-economic terms and to protect the environment. Valuable lessons learned from this PPP project will feed into a global dialogue on influencing and implementing water policies for agriculture.
50,000 of the poorer and marginalised coffee farming households with limited access to knowhow are receiving training on good agricultural practices, including water management. There is potential for outreach to 500,000 coffee-farming households or 2 million beneficiaries. On the assumption that 50,000 households optimise their irrigation management, this will release additional water resources for annual household consumption involving around 650,000 water users in Vietnam (12% of the Central Highland’s population). Optimisation of water use in the coffee sector will make water available for other uses, such as domestic use, other water users in agriculture, e.g. rice, pepper, cocoa farming, and industry, e.g. wet coffee processing, as well as for power generation, e.g. for hydro-power.
Goals and targets
Sustainable Development Strategy 2016–2019 sets out the Federal Council’s policy priorities for sustainable development in the medium to long term. It also lists actions that the Confederation will take to implement the strategy during the current legislative period. In addition, the SDS indicates the contribution that Switzerland will make to implement the 2030 Agenda and SDGs during this period. The aim is to align the strategy as comprehensively as possible with the 2030 Agenda to ensure that Switzerland plays a full part in achieving the SDGs by 2030.
Swiss action plan 
The action plan of the SDS is intended to set specific areas of emphasis which have been determined by the Federal Council in those priority policy areas where it identifies the greatest need for action. These priorities are based on the general focus areas of federal government policy overall, on the objectives determined by the 2030 Agenda and the outcomes of stakeholder dialogue.
The 2030 Agenda provides a framework for addressing the key challenges all countries must overcome in a way appropriate to their national contexts and particular circumstances. In this spirit, the Swiss Action Plan is structured into nine action areas in the priority policy fields for sustainable development, including its global dimensions and the interaction between Switzerland and other countries. Each of these is composed of a long-term vision for Switzerland, the current medium-term challenges, the Federal Council’s goals that are derived from these challenges and which are to be met by 2030, and the action that the Federal Council will take during the 2015–2019 legislative period. 
The listed measures are not intended to be exhaustive, rather they provide focal points for individual policy areas. The general trend in the specific action areas is tracked by the sustainable development monitoring system MONET (see p. 18). 
 


SWISS GREEN ECONOMY 
Since 2010, the Swiss Federal Council has been committed to the “green economy”, which makes an important contribution to sustainable development through measures to improve the environment and strengthen the economy. In April 2016, the Federal Council adopted the report entitled: “Green Economy – Federal measures for a resource-conserving, future-proof Switzerland” which assesses the implementation of the 2013 Green Economy Action Plan and outlines the further development of the green economy on the existing legislative basis (http://www.bafu.admin.ch/ wirtschaft/index.html?lang=en). The measures translate the cross-cutting strategies enshrined in the SDGs and the Federal Council’s Sustainable Development Strategy into concrete action. 
The measures needed to achieve the green economy focus on the three core areas: consumption and production, waste and raw materials, as well as cross-cutting instruments. They include among other things efforts to be made in the areas of sustainable public procurement, waste prevention, sustainable finance, and higher education. 
The Confederation (Federal Department of the Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications (DETEC) / Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN) is required to report every four years on the status of implementation of the measures, the progress achieved and the further development of the green economy. The next report is due at the end of 2019. Moreover, in February 2016, the Federal Council declared itself aware and willing to take sustainability into account in its financial market policies and in March 2016 decided to invest CHF 20 million into research in this area.
ACTION AREAS AND OBJECTIVES 
1 Consumption and production (SDG 12)
• Wherever they operate, companies fulfil their social responsibility in Switzerland and abroad.
• Companies achieve maximum resource-efficiency by optimising the design of their production processes and products.
• The economic and technical potential for closing materials cycles is used.
• Consumers have the information they need to enable them to make their purchase decisions on the basis of quality, safety and health considerations, and in the knowledge of the environmental and social impacts of their decisions. 
• Private consumption helps to reduce resource use and the associated environmental impact.
2 Urban development, mobility and infrastructure (SDGs 9 and 11)
• Spatial development is polycentric, characterised by a strong network of towns and cities. Regional strengths are exploited.
• Urban sprawl is curbed, and settlement growth is restricted to the planned development areas and corridors. Agricultural land and open spaces are largely protected from further development.
• New housing is created by means of high-quality inward development. There are sufficient open spaces  adapted to meet residents› needs.
• Both underground and overground structures are planned, built, operated and continuously developed in ac-cordance with recognised standards of sustainability. They provide a solution that is optimised throughout the structure›s life cycle.
• As settlements grow, architectural heritage is preserved as far as possible, and the standards applied to new or refurbished buildings is high.
• The necessary infrastructures and spaces to meet needs for sport and recreation are available both within and outside urban areas.
• Travel needs are satisfied by an efficient, economical and environmentally friendly system that is networked across different modes of transport and operates at optimum occupancy levels.
• The transport infrastructure is no larger than necessary to perform its particular function, ensures appropriate coverage and guarantees that the transport system meets both qualitative and quantitative requirements.
• Suitable measures are in place to protect settlements and infrastructures from natural hazards.
3 Energy and climate (SDGs 7 and 13)
• Greenhouse gas emissions are 50% lower than in 1990. At least 30% of the total reduction is achieved by measures within Switzerland (average reduction of 25% by 2021, 30% by 2030).
• Average per-capita energy consumption is 34% lower than in 2000 (16% lower by 2020, 43% lower by 2035).
• Average per-capita electricity consumption is 10% lower than in 2000 (3% lower by 2020, 13% lower by 2035).
• Average domestic electricity generation from renewable energies is at least 49 TWh, 37 TWh of which comes from hydropower (51 TWh in total with a hydropower share of 37 TWh by 2035).
• The implications of climate change for natural hazard processes are known, and changes in risk are identified at an early stage.
• The risks attached to climate change are minimised: use is made of climate-related opportunities; people, property and natural habitats are protected; and the economy, environment and society have all become more adaptable.
4 Natural resources (SDGs 2, 6, 14, and 15)
• Switzerland has an ecological infrastructure of reserves and habitat networks in place. Improvements have been made to both the state of undeveloped areas and the conservation status of wildlife species.
• Soil function is preserved for the long term. Soil use does not result in degradation and, where possible, soils and their functions are restored.
• Forests are managed and used efficiently in a way that preserves their natural qualities. All forest functions are fulfilled equally, and their basic spatial structure is preserved without any shrinkage in the land area cov-ered.
• The landscape continues to be developed and shaped while preserving its character. The benefits of the land-scape are recognised and secured.
• The Swiss agricultural and food sector is competitive, resilient, environmentally friendly and resource-efficient along the entire value chain.


Swiss foreign policy
The SDS and its Action Plan also list selected foreign policy activities where these are relevant to the achievement of the objectives in Switzerland. Switzerland is committed to sustainable development around the world through its foreign policy, including its foreign economic policy, international environmental policy, international cooperation, and other foreign policies for individual sectors. With its engagement in international processes geared towards specific sectors (including multilateral conventions, bilateral agreements, as well as regional and global (UN) programmes), Switzerland contributes to the advancement of sustainable development in all its dimensions.
The new Swiss Foreign Policy Strategy 2016–2019 defines the broad outlines of Switzerland’s international commitment for the legislative period until 2019. Sustainable development forms one of the four key priorities of the strategy. The key focal points here are the alleviation of poverty and global risks, relieving need, the protection and sustainable use of natural resources, peace promotion and inclusive societies, and respect for human rights. The Swiss Confederation is engaged in transforming the economy and society to ensure respect for planetary boundaries and the well-being of current and future generations. In addition to its domestic policy efforts, in this way it also makes a specific contribution at the international level to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and to the SDGs in particular. 
When deploying its instruments of international cooperation and its foreign policies for individual sectors, the Swiss Confederation takes care to adhere to a coherent sustainable development policy. This means structuring and coordinating the different areas of foreign policy to ensure that they are as non-contradictory as possible and that they actively encourage synergies. The same applies to coordination between foreign and domestic policy. Under the aegis of its sectoral foreign policies, as well as international processes and initiatives, the Confederation is involved in programmes and contributions to political dialogue at partner-country level and on the international stage to manage global risks and implement the 2030 Agenda. This work specifically covers foreign policies on environment, health, foreign trade, business and finance, as well as agriculture and migration. 

THE 10YFP SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS PROGRAMME
The Rio+20 Conference reaffirmed that sustainable consumption and production is a cornerstone of sustainable development and established the 10 Year Framework of Programmes on sustainable consumption and production (10YFP) in order to decouple economic growth from the rising rates of natural resource use and the environmental impacts. With the adoption of the SDGs, SCP has also become an integral part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
The 10YFP consists of a wide-ranging portfolio of six programmes, among others including sustainable public procurement or sustainable food systems. The Sustainable Food Systems Programme (SFS) is a multi-stakeholder initiative to accelerate the shift towards more sustainable food systems. Switzerland co-leads the 10YFP SFS Programme together with South Africa, WWF and Hivos, and with the support of a 23 member Multi-stakeholder Advisory Committee (MAC). Furthermore, the Programme currently has more than 70 partners worldwide from different sectors. 
The 10YFP SFS programme aims to promote sustainability all along the food value chain, from farm to fork. It does so through concrete activities including in the areas of awareness raising, capacity development, facilitating access to knowledge and information, and strengthening partnerships. The programme brings together existing initiatives and partnerships working in related areas, highlighting good practices and success stories, and builds synergies and promotes cooperation among stakeholders to leverage resources towards mutual objectives and minimise duplication of ongoing efforts. 
Within its four work areas, the programme focuses on themes such as the promotion of sustainable diets and the reduction of food losses and waste. The programme thus makes a direct contribution to the implementation of SDG2 on food security, nutrition and sustainable agriculture, and SDG12 on sustainable consumption and production, as well as a series of targets under other SDGs including those in relation to poverty reduction, health, water, sustainable growth, climate change, biodiversity and multi-stakeholder partnerships.
Dispatch on International Cooperation 2017–20
Through its Dispatch on International Cooperation 2017–20, which is based on the 2030 Agenda and other points of reference, the Federal Council applies for framework financing facilities and determines the instruments that will be used to implement the SDGs as part of Switzerland’s international cooperation activities. This draws in particular on framework credits for each of the five policy instruments humanitarian aid, technical cooperation and financial assistance for developing countries, economic and trade policy measures for development cooperation, transition assistance and cooperation with Eastern Europe, as well as promotion of peace and human security. In addition to the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA), the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) of the Federal Department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research (EAER) is also involved in international development cooperation.
With regular dispatches on international cooperation, Switzerland sets out the priorities and focal areas which guide its development cooperation for a period of four years. Switzerland’s international cooperation in the period from 2017 to 2020 is guided by the following seven objectives with gender equality and governance as cross-cutting themes:
1. Contribute to the development of an international framework for responding to global challenges; 
2. Prevent and manage the consequences of crisis and disaster and of fragility; promote conflict transformation;
3. Support sustainable access to resources and services for all;
4. Promote sustainable economic growth;
5. Strengthen the rule of law and democratic participation; support institutions serving society and the economy; 
6. Ensure respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and support efforts to advance their cause;
7. Strengthen gender equality and the rights of women and girls.
In the Federal Council Dispatch 2017–20 Switzerland will focus its efforts as follows in order to strengthen its contribution to the achievement of corresponding SDGs and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda: 
» Increase funding for basic education and vocational training;
» Strengthen gender equality and the rights of women and girls;
» Promote economic growth for the benefit of all, and in particular increase the quality and quantity of jobs available and improve the underlying conditions for economic activity; » Increase emergency aid in order to better help and protect people affected by crises and disasters, particularly the millions of refugees and internally displaced persons in the Middle East; » Strengthen efforts to promote the resolution of armed conflicts by peaceful means; » Play a pioneering role in areas of global scope, such as food security, climate change and environment, water, migration and development, as well as international finance and trade;
» Increased and focused support for the implementation of multilateral environmental agreements;
» Manage natural resources and ecosystems in a sustainable way to reduce the impact of climate change on the poorest, most disadvantaged and vulnerable populations.
» Strengthen partnerships with the private sector and diversify sources of funding for sustainable development;
Institutional mechanisms
Sustainable development is not to be considered as an additional topic of the Swiss Confederation’s remit, but rather is to be integrated as far as possible into the usual planning and policy management processes at all levels. Political responsibility therefore lies with the Federal Council. Implementation of the SDS, however, is primarily a matter for the federal offices concerned, which must ensure that the policy details are determined to reflect their particular areas of activity and that the strategy is put into practice and that its measures are well coordinated. As is the case with provisions at constitutional level, as well as at the level of laws and ordinances, submissions to the Federal Council must be aligned with the strategy, and the agencies must factor its principles into their planning and internal processes. In doing this, they must make use of synergies, ensure coherence between sectoral policies, and flag any conflicting objectives. 
Sustainable development should be achieved primarily by setting priorities and reallocating existing resources. It is therefore to be implemented mainly via existing coordination and reconciliation mechanisms, while avoiding duplication and overlaps.
Coordination of domestic policy
The implementation of the SDS in domestic policy is coordinated by the Interdepartmental Sustainable Development Committee (ISDC), which comprises representatives of all federal offices whose activities are of relevance to sustainable development. The ISDC assumes the function of a coordination and discussion platform for sustainability-related activities and processes within the Federal Administration. It encourages cooperation between federal agencies, as well as the integration of sustainable development principles into sectoral policies. 
The ISDC is chaired by the Federal Office for Spatial Development (ARE) of the Federal Department of the Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications (DETEC). As the competent specialist unit within the Swiss Confederation, it guarantees the consistency and effectiveness of work to implement the SDS and ensures communication and dialogue both within the Federal Administration and with external actors.
Coordination of Switzerland’s international engagement 
In autumn 2012, an inter-ministerial task force was established to coordinate Switzerland’s engagement and draft the Swiss position for the international preparatory process and negotiations on the 2030 Agenda and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. Since then, the inter-ministerial task force has coordinated international processes and negotiations directly relating to the 2030 Agenda and has handled coordination within the Federal Administration. It is currently composed of 16 federal offices that deal at the sectoral policy or general level with sustainable development issues in foreign policy. As an information, coordination and discussion platform led by the FDFA, the task force guarantees Switzerland’s foreign policy contribution to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. 
With regard to the sectoral international policies such as climate change, biodiversity or health, each federal office has the responsibility to coordinate its international engagement with other ministries concerned to ensure coherence and orientation towards sustainable development.
Coordination between national and international levels (2016–17 transition phase)
With the 2030 Agenda, and in view of its effective implementation at all levels, coordination between domestic and foreign policy has gained higher importance. Coordination between national and international levels is assured by means of regular exchanges between the ISDC, the task force, and other bodies. While involving the sectoral federal offices concerned, the competent units within the ARE and the SDC are responsible for the flow of information and for coordinating activities in the transition phase.
2016–17 transition phase for the alignment of Swiss sustainability policy to the 2030 Agenda
During a transition phase from 2016 to 2017, the alignment of the Swiss sustainability policy to the 2030 Agenda will be developed further. Questions relating to institutional arrangements will be examined and modifications proposed where necessary. Particular attention must be paid to coordinating national and international processes as effectively as possible. Building on existing structures, the aim is to arrive at an efficient process within the Confederation to implement the 2030 Agenda through domestic and foreign policies. Synergies should be created between national and international processes while avoiding duplication. Initial work will also be done on what exactly the implementation of the SDGs will entail. 
A comprehensive programme of work (see p. 11) for the transition phase is put into practice. This work is managed by an inter-ministerial working group, comprising representatives active at both national and international level. It is led by the ARE and the SDC. The working group also includes representatives from the Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN), the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH), the Federal Office for Agriculture (FOAG), the Federal Statistical Office (FSO), the FDFA Directorate of Political Affairs, and the Federal Chancellery. 
The inter-ministerial working group developed the joint programme of work, for which the competent federal offices provide the necessary funding and resources. It consults with all relevant federal offices and encourages exchange with actors from outside the Federal Administration. 
Monitoring, follow-up and review
To weigh up interests and to make political decisions, countries need to know where they stand with regard to key success and deficit parameters related to sustainable development. Measuring sustainable development has thus become an increasingly important instrument of implementation. Switzerland has had a comprehensive sustainable development monitoring system (MONET) in place since 2003. Its 73 regularly updated indicators give an overall picture. 
The MONET system takes a holistic approach, measuring the quality of life of the present generation as well as fairness of distribution both geographically and over time (see p. 12). It observes whether and in what areas Switzerland is on the path to sustainable development. MONET is an evolving system, in which indicators are revised as new focal points and framework conditions for sustainable development emerge. With this in mind, the system’s reference framework has been amended to take into account the SDGs and the SDS. The current legislative period will bring further expansion to allow the MONET system to measure the implementation of the SDGs along a significant choice of indicators, amongst others those recommended by the UN Statistical Commission in March 2016. It will thus lay the foundation for both national and international reporting. 

THE MONET INDICATOR SYSTEM: A HOLISTIC SYSTEM OF MONITORING SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN SWITZERLAND
The MONET indicator system has made it possible for Switzerland, since 2003, to determine whether the country is on the path to sustainable development. The 73 regularly updated indicators of the system are published on the internet by the Federal Statistical Office (FSO). A selection of 36 of the system’s indicators is used for monitoring progress in the implementation of the SDS 2016–2019.
The MONET system is based on a conceptual framework comprising a frame of reference, an indicator typology, and predefined criteria and processes. This conceptual framework ensures that the indicator system measures sustainable development in a holistic manner, integrating the three dimensions of sustainable development and the interaction between them.
The frame of reference of the MONET system makes it possible to answer the question: “What to measure?” It is based on the definition of sustainable development published in the Brundtland Report (UN 1987) and the three dimensions of sustainable development. In order to concretise these two references and to focus them on specific aspects, 47 principles of sustainable development have been formulated.
The systemic approach is ensured by a typology of indicators to answer the question: “How to measure?” The MONET typology models the processes that are relevant for sustainable development and ensures  its holistic measurement. It allows an integrated approach by combining the dimensions “here and now”, “later” and “elsewhere”. The typology also integrates processes such as the efficient use of resources and societal and political measures that aim to correct undesired change.
The conceptual framework of the MONET system has been adopted by other countries and corresponds with the Conference of European Statisticians’ recommendation on measuring sustainable development (UN 2014). The system was revised in 2014 to 2015 with the objective of anticipating the Sustainable Development Goals. The revision of the MONET system, published in 2016, led to an adaptation of the frame of reference and of the indicators with a view to closing the gap between the system and the evolving international and national context of sustainable development (see Annex).Information on target achievement and the implementation of measures under the SDS Action Plan (see p. 14) is regularly updated and published, and the Federal Council is required to produce a report on the implementation of the current strategy by the end of 2018. This will comprise an evaluation as well as a proposal for the next version of the strategy for the 2020–23 legislative period. 
Furthermore, the federal offices are required to include sustainable development in their own periodic reports on items of business or areas covered by their sectoral policies. In order to measure and report on contributions to SDGs through its international cooperation, Switzerland will, as a first step, align the monitoring system for its 2017–20 strategy with SDG targets and indicators. 
The Confederation is also committed to actively engage in the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) alongside all other countries and all relevant stakeholder representatives. Accordingly, it will participate in the planned periodic reporting and implementation monitoring for the SDGs, provide specific input on how the basis of data can be improved, and help developing countries build their national capacities to draft national strategies for sustainable development and to track their implementation. Furthermore, the Confederation is committed to strengthening governance in specific sectors. 
Means of implementation Financing sustainable development
National implementation of the Sustainable Development Strategy 2016–2019 is funded via the budgets that have been approved for the individual federal offices, which are responsible for incorporating the necessary financial resources in their financial planning. Should additional funding be required for measures in parallel with strategy implementation, it must be applied for as part of the normal budget process. 
The Swiss Confederation also supports the comprehensive financing and implementation framework adopted by all UN member states at the Third International Conference on Financing for Development: the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. Key importance is attached to domestic resource mobilisation as the primary source of financing for sustainable development in developing and emerging economies, as well as to its efficient and fair use. In this way, the Confederation boosts its support for the establishment of taxation systems and efficient financial administrations in developing countries. It is also committed to a coordinated international effort to eliminate the causes of illicit financial flows based notably on international standards issued by recognised bodies. Domestically, it implements the relevant international standards, for instance for combating corruption and money laundering, as well as those that apply to cross-border tax issues. Through its asset recovery programme, it also helps to ensure that funds which enter Switzerland illegally can be returned to their countries of origin.
At international level, Switzerland mainly contributes to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda through its international cooperation, as outlined on p. 14,  as well as through other specific financial mechanisms such as the Global Environmental Facility GEF. In 2015, despite cost-saving measures, Switzerland spent CHF 3.404 billion on official development assistance (ODA) (0.52% of GNI), an increase of CHF 182 million over 2014. This increase was made possible as a result of decisions by Parliament in recent years to make additional funds available. Switzerland ranks eighth among the 29 member states of the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC). The largest part of Swiss ODA is deployed in the poorest countries, in conflict-affected contexts and fragile states, as well as in middle-income countries. Efforts to improve the effectiveness and transparency of public development aid funding will also be continued, including in the context of the Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation and the UN Development Cooperation Forum. 
Instruments and partnerships 
The Swiss Confederation increasingly uses sustainability assessments as a prospective means of evaluation and optimisation to analyse the social, economic and environmental impacts of Swiss projects and initiatives at strategy, planning programme or project level. The method centres on the systematic capture of an initiative’s direct and indirect, desirable and undesirable effects. 
Switzerland has a long tradition of partnership between governmental and non-governmental actors. Where sectoral policy is concerned, policymakers have been working alongside interested associations and non-governmental organisations – primarily from the environmental, development cooperation, business and social spheres – on a regular basis for many years. At the international level, the authorities involve these organisations in preparations for important negotiations. They have provided major impetus to sustainable development in Switzerland, most recently in the preparation of the Swiss position on the 2030 Agenda negotiations. 
The Swiss Confederation is taking steps to adapt the SDGs to Switzerland’s national context and to put them into effect in partnerships in all areas and at all levels. The implementation partnerships between the Confederation, cantons, communes and representatives of business, civil society, politics and academia should thus remain focused on the sectoral level. That being said, these partnerships will also be further consolidated at the general level of national Swiss sustainability policy as part of the ”Dialogue 2030 on Sustainable Development”. This will ensure a coordinated approach between the various areas and enable broader partnerships, such as multi-stakeholder initiatives, to be established. How exactly the different actors can be involved in implementation and how their contributions can be acknowledged are among the issues that will have to be addressed within the 2016–17 transition phase.
Next steps
In accordance with the Federal Council decision of December 2015, Switzerland has launched a national process to define and take concrete steps to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The 2030 Agenda provides the overarching reference framework for Switzerland’s interpretation of sustainable development as a concept and its translation into action in the various policy areas at national and international level. As laid out in the present report, the following measures are being or will be taken during the 2016–17 transition phase: 
» A baseline study and a gap analysis are being conducted to identify and define future areas for implementing the 2030 Agenda; 
» The future process needed to implement the 2030 Agenda will be determined and the internal structure and the allocation of responsibilities within the Federal Administration will be defined; 
» The sustainable monitoring system MONET to ensure adequate monitoring and reporting will be expanded; 
» The modalities for stakeholder participation in consultations and in implementation partnerships for the 2030 Agenda will be determined;
» The reporting will be aligned with UN requirements, and Switzerland’s first substantive report to the HLPF on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda in 2018 will be prepared. 
By early 2018, a report summarising these efforts and formulating corresponding recommendations for Switzerland’s implementation of the 2030 Agenda will be presented to the Federal Council. On the basis of the findings from the transition phase and decisions taken by the Federal Council, Switzerland will present a first comprehensive country review at the HLPF 2018. 

Conclusions
The Swiss Confederation is highly committed to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. At national level, this will happen through the specific targets defined in the SDS oriented to SDGs targets. At international level, Switzerland is orienting its international cooperation efforts to the 2030 Agenda and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, while aligning the monitoring system for its international cooperation with SDG targets and indicators. Henceforth, Switzerland will report regularly to the UN (HLPF) on its progress with the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. Follow-up and review at all levels will provide useful opportunities for peer learning, including through voluntary reviews, sharing of best practices and discussions on shared targets.
With the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development a historic decision on a comprehensive, far-reaching and people-centred set of universal and transformative goals has been taken. Switzerland, among all other UN member states, is committed to working for the full implementation of the 2030 Agenda and to achieving sustainable development in its three dimensions – economic, social and environmental – in a balanced and integrated manner. The SDGs are embedded in a narrative of transformative change to realise a common vision of ending poverty in all its forms, of social inclusion and universal human development that respects human rights and planetary boundaries to ensure that no one is left behind.  
The implementation of the 2030 Agenda provides many opportunities to advance sustainable development on a local, national, regional and global scale. However, contributing both nationally and internationally to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the achievement of the SDGs, as well as measuring and reporting on progress in a meaningful way will also present new challenges for the organisational structure and processes of the Swiss Confederation. 
Switzerland’s aim in the future is therefore to align its SDS comprehensively with the 2030 Agenda to secure its contribution to the achievement of the SDGs by 2030. It is important that the Swiss Confederation, the cantons and communes work closely with civil society, the academic community, politicians and the private sector. There must also be closer coordination between implementation at the national and international levels, and appropriate monitoring and review mechanisms must be created which, where possible, also include nonstate, in particular, private sector action. 
The necessary implementation steps are all being lined up with a view to ensuring that Switzerland is in a position by 2018 to further increase and report on its significant share in the transformation of our world towards sustainable development by 2030.
1 Article 2 describes the primary purpose of the Confederation, which is to promote common welfare, sustainable development, internal cohesion and cultural diversity (para. 2). It is also committed to the long-term preservation of natural resources and to a just and peaceful international order (para. 4). Under Article 73, the Confederation and cantons are bound to ensure “a balanced and sustainable relationship between nature and its capacity to renew itself, and the demands placed on it by the population”. Article 54, meanwhile, specifies Switzerland’s foreign policy objectives, which reflect important elements of sustainable development: encouraging welfare, helping to alleviate poverty and need in the world, promoting respect for human rights and democracy, the peaceful co-existence of peoples, and the conservation of natural resources.
