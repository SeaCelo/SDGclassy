Indicator 16.2.1: Proportion of children aged 1-17 years who experienced any physical punishment and/or psychological aggression by caregivers in the past month
Target 16.2: End abuse, exploitation, trafficking and all forms of violence against and torture of children
Goal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the percentage of children aged 1-17 years who experienced any physical punishment or psychological aggression or both by caregivers in the past month. 
Concepts:
Psychological aggression refers to the actions of shouting, yelling or screaming at a child, and calling a child offensive names such as ‘dumb’ or ‘lazy’. 
Physical or corporal punishment are actions intended to cause physical pain or discomfort, but not injuries. They include – shaking the child, hitting or slapping on the hand/arm/leg, hitting on the bottom or elsewhere on the body with a hard object, spanking or hitting on the bottom with bare hands, hitting or slapping on the face, head or ears, and repeated rough beating.  
Rationale and Interpretation:
The use of violent (physical or verbal) disciplining techniques are a violation of children’s rights, and can result in immediate effects and long-term consequences that children carry well into adulthood. It is the most widespread and socially accepted type of violence against children.  
Data Sources and Collection Method
Data for this indicator is collected through nationally representative household surveys that include a module on violence against children which are conducted by national statistical offices. Internationally coordinated household surveys such as the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) and the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) also collect this data in low and middle-income countries.
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
The percentage of children aged 1-17 years who experienced any physical punishment or psychological aggression or both by caregivers in the past month (PCV) is calculated as: 
￼
where,
Nvio is the number of children aged 1-17 years who experienced any physical and/or psychological aggression by caregivers in the past month; and
Ntotal is the total number of children aged 1-17 years. 
Comments and limitations:
The Parent-Child version of the Conflict Tactics Scale (CTSPC) is a standardized and validated measurement tool that is widely accepted and implemented, for assessing violence against children. 
General comment no. 13 on the Convention of the Rights of the Child (CRC) provides a definition for ‘corporal/physical’ punishment as well as ‘mental violence’. 
Proxy, alternative and additional indicators:
At the global level, this indicator is currently being measured by the Proportion of children aged 1-14 years who experienced any physical punishment and/or psychological aggression by caregivers in the past month.
Data Disaggregation
The indicator can be disaggregated by sex, age, income, place of residence (rural/urban) and geographic location. In addition to these standard levels of disaggregation, this indicator can be usefully disaggregated in some surveys by mother’s level of education, ethnicity, religion, child functional difficulty and mother’s functional difficulties.
Indicator 16.2.3: Proportion of young women and men aged 18-29 years who experienced sexual violence by age 18
Target 16.2: End abuse, exploitation, trafficking and all forms of violence against and torture of children 
Goal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the percentage of young women and men (aged 18-29 years) who experienced sexual violence by the age of 18. This indicator is always reported on separately for women and men. 
Concepts:
According to General Comment no. 13 on the Convention of the Rights of the Child (CRC), sexual violence against children comprises any sexual activities imposed by an adult on a child against which the child is entitled to protection by criminal law. This includes:
(1) The inducement or coercion of a child to engage in any unlawful or psychologically harmful sexual activity;
(2) The use of children in commercial sexual exploitation;
(3) The use of children in audio or visual images of child sexual abuse; and
(4) Child prostitution, sexual slavery, sexual exploitation in travel and tourism, trafficking for purposes of sexual exploitation (within and between countries), sale of children for sexual purposes and forced marriage. 
Sexual activities are also considered as abuse when committed against a child by another child if the offender is significantly older than the victim or uses power, threat or other means of pressure. Consensual sexual activities between children are not considered as sexual abuse if the children are older than the age limit defined by the State Party. 
‘Sexual violence’ is operationally defined in the indicator as sexual intercourse or any other sexual acts that were forced, physically or in any other way. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
Experiences of sexual violence in childhood hinder all aspects of development: physical, psychological/emotional and social. Apart from the physical injuries that can result, researchers have consistently found that the sexual abuse of children is associated with a wide array of mental health consequences and adverse behavioural outcomes in adulthood. The issue is universally relevant, and the indicator captures one of the gravest forms of violence against children. The right of children to protection from all forms of violence is outlined in the CRC and its Optional Protocols.
Data Sources and Collection Method
Data for this indicator is collected through nationally representative household surveys that include a module on violence against children or violence against women and men which are conducted by national statistical offices. Internationally coordinated household surveys such as the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) also collect this data in low and middle-income countries. 
It is crucial that fundamental principles are followed for the ethical collection of sound data when conducting research on violence. Key considerations include ensuring that questions are asked in a sufficiently sensitive manner; securing informed consent; protecting respondents from unnecessary danger or risk of re-traumatization; maintaining confidentiality; and instituting clear procedures for providing follow-up support for respondents. UNICEF is currently developing a set of methodological and ethical guidelines for the collection of data on violence against children. 
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
The percentage of young men and women (aged 18-29 years) who experienced sexual violence by the age of 18 (P­CSV) can be calculated as: 
￼
where,
NCSV is the number of young women and men (aged 18-29 years) who report having experienced any sexual violence by age 18; and
Ntotal is the total number of young women and men aged 18-29 years. 
Comments and limitations:
Comparability of data for this indicator remains a challenge due to different study methodologies and designs, definitions of sexual violence, and sampling frames and questionnaires. 
Another challenge is the underreporting of experiences of sexual violence in childhood, especially when it comes to reporting on experiences of sexual violence among boys and men.

Indicator 16.8.1: Proportion of members and voting rights of developing countries in international organizations 
Target 16.8: Broaden and strengthen the participation of developing countries in the institutions of global governance
Goal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This global indicator is defined as the percentage of members (or voting rights) in international organizations that are (or belong to) developing countries. For institutions where membership and voting rights are different, this indicator observes the percentages separately.
Concepts:
International organizations comprise the following eleven multi-lateral institutions for the purposes of this indicator:
(1)     UN General Assembly;
(2)    UN Security Council;
(3)    UN Economic and Social Council;
(4)    International Monetary Fund;
(5)    International Bank for Reconstruction and Development;
(6)    International Finance Corporation;
(7)    African Development Bank;
(8)    Asian Development Bank;
(9)    Inter-American Development Bank;
(10) World Trade Organization; and
(11) Financial Stability Board. 
There is no established convention for the designation of developing countries in the UN system. But, in common practice, developing countries refer to all other countries besides Japan, Canada, the United States of America, Australia, New Zealand and European countries. The aggregation across all institutions is currently done according to the United Nations M.49 statistical standard which includes designation of “developed regions” and “developing regions”. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
The United Nations is based on the principle of sovereign equality of all its member states (Article 2, UN Charter). This indicator aims to measure the degree to which states enjoy equal representation in different international organizations. 
Data Sources and Collection Method
Annual reports of each of the international organizations are used as sources of data. Membership and voting rights information are published every year.
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
The following formula is used for each organization to calculate the percentage of voting rights to developing countries (PVDev): 
 ￼
The following formula is used for each organization to calculate the percentage of members from developing countries (PMDev):
￼
The same formulas can be used to calculate the percentage of the membership for each country or the percentage of voting rights for each country. 
Comments and limitations:
As a structural indicator, only small changes will be observed over time which reflect agreement on new States joining as members, suspension of voting rights, membership withdrawal and negotiated voting rights changes. Cross-institutional comparisons need to pay attention to the different memberships of intuitions. Voting rights and memberships in their institutions are agreed to by the member states themselves. 
Proxy, alternative and additional indicators: N/A
Data Disaggregation
As only States can be members there is no disaggregation by sex, gender, age, disability, etc.
Indicator 16.9.1: Proportion of children under 5 years of age whose births have been registered with a civil authority, by age
Target 16.9: By 2030, provide legal identity for all, including birth registration
Goal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the percentage of children under 5 years of age whose births have been registered with a civil authority. 
Concepts: 
Birth registration: Birth registration is defined as ‘the continuous, permanent and universal recording, within the civil registry, of the occurrence and characteristics of births in accordance with the legal requirements of a country’. 
Civil authority: Official authorized to register the occurrence of a vital event and to record the required details. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
Registering children at birth is the first step in securing their recognition before the law, safeguarding their rights, and ensuring any violation of their rights does not go unnoticed. Children’s right to a name and nationality is enshrined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) under Article 7. Registration of birth is one of the foundations of legal identity which ensures access to basic services such as healthcare and education. It also provides a legal basis for age. This indicator is, therefore, a direct measure of the progress on target 16.9.
Data Sources and Collection Method
Civil registration systems that are functioning effectively compile vital statistics that are used to compare the estimated total number of births in a country with the absolute number of registered births during a given period. These data normally refer to live births that were registered within a year or the legal time frame for registration applicable in the country.
In cases where civil registration systems are unavailable or do not function effectively, nationally representative household surveys that collect data on birth registration can provide data on this indicator. Internationally coordinated household surveys such as the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) and Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) also collect data on this indicator.
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
The percentage of children under 5 years of age whose births have been registered with a civil authority (Preg) can be calculated as: 
￼
Comments and limitations: 
This indicator should ideally be calculated using vital statistics obtained from civil registration systems. However, this remains a challenge in many countries due to a lack of functioning systems; furthermore, data obtained from CRVS differ slightly from the SDG indicator since it typically refers to the proportion of births that have been registered (within a specific timeframe). As a result, household surveys have become a key source of data to monitor levels and trends in birth registration in many low- and middle-income countries. 
Proxy, alternative and additional indicators: N/A
Data Disaggregation
Disaggregation by age is required for this indicator. It can also be disaggregated by sex, income, place of residence (rural/urban), and geographic location. In addition to these standard levels of disaggregation, this indicator can be usefully disaggregated in some surveys by mother’s level of education, ethnicity, religion, child functional difficulty and mother’s functional difficulties. There is typically more potential to disaggregate survey data as opposed to statistics derived from civil registration systems.
Indicator 16.a.1: Existence of independent national human rights institutions in compliance with the Paris Principles
Target 16.a: Strengthen relevant national institutions, including through international cooperation, for building capacity at all levels, in particular in developing countries, to prevent violence and combat terrorism and crime
Goal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator assesses the existence of independent national human rights institutions with the Principles relating to the Status of National Institutions (The Paris Principles), which were adopted by the General Assembly (resolution 48/134) based on the rules of procedure of the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI, formerly the International Coordinating Committee of National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights or ICC). 
Concepts:
A National Human Rights Institution (NHRI) is an independent administrative body set up by a country with a constitutional or legislative mandate to promote and protect human rights. They are a part of the national administration but operate independently from the government. The general role of NHRIs is to address discrimination in all its forms, as well as to promote the protection of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. Core functions of NHRIs include complaint handling, human rights education and making recommendations on law reform. An independent NHRI has ‘A level’ accreditation to the Paris Principles. 
Paris Principles were adopted by the UN General Assembly in Resolution 48/134 on 20th December 1993, and provide the international standards on the independent functioning of NHRI. These standards serve as the basis on which NHRIs are accredited by the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI). For more information, see: http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/StatusOfNationalInstitutions.aspx 
GANHRI is the international association of NHRIs which promotes and strengthens NHRIs to be in accordance with the Paris Principles and provides leadership in the promotion and protection of human rights (ICC Statute, Art. 5). 
Accreditation by GANHRI entails determination whether NHRI are compliant, both in law and in practice, with the Paris principles. The process is conducted by the Sub-Committee on Accreditation (SCA) of the GANHRI. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
Accreditation of NHRIs shows that the government has a strong commitment to realize human rights in the country. Effective NHRIs are an important link between government and civil society. They contribute significantly to bridging the “protection gap” between the human rights of individuals and the State’s obligations under international law. Six models of NHRIs exist across all regions of the world today, namely: human rights commissions, human rights ombudsperson institutions, hybrid institutions, consultative and advisory bodies, institutes and centres and multiple institutions. This indicator expresses whether any of these models exist in a country and is independently functioning to protect and promote human rights, including by preventing and redressing their violations. 
Data Sources and Collection Method
The data for this indicator is collected from the administrative records of the GANHRI on the accreditation status of all NHRI. 
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
This indicator is based on the level of accreditation of NHRI by the SCA of the GAHNRI. The levels of accreditation are as follows:
(1)    A: Full compliance with Paris Principles;
(2)    B: Not fully in compliance with the Paris Principles or insufficient information provided to make a determination; and
(3)    C: Non-compliant with the Paris Principles. 
Decisions on the classifications of NHRIs are conducted by GAHNRI based on their submitted documents such as:
(1)    Copy of legislation or other instrument by which it is established and empowered in its official or published format (e.g. statute, and /or constitutional provisions, and/or presidential decree;
(2)    Outline of organizational structure including details of staff and annual budget;
(3)    Copy of recent published annual report; and
(4)    Detailed statement showing how it complies with the Paris Principles. 
The SCA reviews NHRIs that hold ‘A’ and ‘B’ statuses every five years. Civil society organizations may also provide relevant information to OHCHR pertaining to any accreditation matter, which are included in the assessments provided to the SCA. 
Comments and limitations:
The important and constructive role of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights has been acknowledged in different United Nations instruments and resolutions, including the Final Document and Programme of Action of the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna, GA resolutions A/RES/63/172 (2008) and A/RES/64/161 (2009) on national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights. In addition, creation and strengthening of NHRIs have also been encouraged. For example, the 1993 GA resolution 48/134 ‘affirms the priority that should be accorded to the development of appropriate arrangements at the national level to ensure the effective implementation of international human rights standards’ while the 2008 GA resolution A/RES/63/169 encouraged states ‘to consider the creation or the strengthening of independent and autonomous Ombudsman, mediator and other national human rights institutions’. The Human Rights Council in HRC resolution 5/1, 2007 also called for the effective participation of national human rights institutions in its institution building package. 
 While this is  a global indicator, it can be monitored at country and regional levels. Data on status of accreditation of NHRIs are shared with individual NHRI and regional NHRI networks and publically available (https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/HRIndicators/NHRI.pdf). National statistical offices may obtain the data directly from their NHRI counterparts or from OHCHR/GANHRI. Similarly, UN regional economic commissions may get the data from regional NHRI networks or OHCHR/GANHRI.

SDG 16: Peace, justice and strong institutions

The threats of international homicide, violence against children, human trafficking and sexual violence are important to address to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development. They pave the way for the provision of access to justice for all and for building effective, accountable institutions at all levels.

While homicide and trafficking cases have seen significant progress over the past decade, there are still thousands of people at greater risk of intentional murder within Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa and around Asia. Childrens rights violations through aggression and sexual violence continue to plague many countries around the world, especially as under-reporting and lack of data aggravate the problem.

To tackle these challenges and build a more peaceful, inclusive societies, there needs to be more efficient and transparent regulations put in place and comprehensive, realistic government budgets. One of the first steps towards protecting individual rights is the implementation of worldwide birth registration and the creation of more independent national human rights institutions around the world.


Among the institutions most affected by corruption are the judiciary and police.
Corruption, bribery, theft and tax evasion cost some US $1.26 trillion for developing countries per year; this amount of money could be used to lift those who are living on less than $1.25 a day above $1.25 for at least six years
Birth registration has occurred for 73 per cent of children under 5, but only 46% of Sub-Saharan Africa have had their births registered.
Approximately 28.5 million primary school age who are out of school live in conflict-affected areas.
The rule of law and development have a significant interrelation and are mutually reinforcing, making it essential for sustainable development at the national and international level.
The proportion of prisoners held in detention without sentencing has remained almost constant in the last decade, at 31% of all prisoners.

Goal 16 targets
Significantly reduce all forms of violence and related death rates everywhere
End abuse, exploitation, trafficking and all forms of violence against and torture of children
Promote the rule of law at the national and international levels and ensure equal access to justice for all significantly reduce illicit financial and arms flows, strengthen the recovery and return of stolen assets and combat all forms of organized crime
Substantially reduce corruption and bribery in all their forms
Develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions at all levels
Ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels
Broaden and strengthen the participation of developing countries in the institutions of global governance provide legal identity for all, including birth registration
Ensure public access to information and protect fundamental freedoms, in accordance with national legislation and international agreements
Strengthen relevant national institutions, including through international cooperation, for building capacity at all levels, in particular in developing countries, to prevent violence and combat terrorism and crime
Promote and enforce non-discriminatory laws and policies for sustainable development


                                                Peaceful, just and inclusive societies are necessary to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.
PEACE, JUSTICE, AND STRONG INSTITUTIONS: WHY THEY MATTER
Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels. 

Peaceful, just and inclusive societies are necessary to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). People everywhere need to be free of fear from all forms of violence and feel safe as they go about their lives whatever their ethnicity, faith or sexual orientation.
In order to advance the SDGs we need effective and inclusive public institutions that can deliver quality education and healthcare, fair economic policies and inclusive environmental protection.

To achieve peace, justice and inclusion, it is important that governments, civil society and communities work together to implement lasting solutions to reduce violence, deliver justice, combat corruption and ensure inclusive participation at all times.
Freedom to express views, in private and in public, must be guaranteed. People must be able to contribute to decisions that affect their lives. Laws and policies must be applied without any form of discrimination. Disputes need to be resolved through functioning political and justice systems.
National and local institutions must be accountable and need to be in place to deliver basic services to families and communities equitably and without the need for bribes.
How does this goal apply to me, wherever I live?
Crimes that threaten the foundation of peaceful societies, including homicides, trafficking and other organized crimes, as well as discriminatory laws or practices, affect all countries. Even the world’s greatest democracies face major challenges in addressing corruption, crime and human rights violations for everyone at home.
Armed violence and insecurity have a destructive impact on a country’s development, affecting economic growth and often resulting in long-standing grievances among communities.
Violence, in all its forms, has a pervasive impact on societies. Violence affects children’s health, development and well-being, and their ability to thrive. It causes trauma and weakens social inclusion.
Lack of access to justice means that conflicts remain unresolved and people cannot obtain protection and redress. Institutions that do not function according to legitimate laws are prone to arbitrariness and abuse of power, and less capable of delivering public services to everyone.
To exclude and to discriminate not only violates human rights, but also causes resentment


Goal 16. Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels
Peace, justice and effective, accountable and inclusive institutions are at the core of sustainable development. Several regions have enjoyed increased and sustained levels of peace and security in recent decades. But many countries still face protracted armed conflict and violence, and far too many people struggle as a result of weak institutions and the lack of access to justice, information and other fundamental freedoms. The number of victims of intentional homicide worldwide remained relatively stable from 2008 to 2014. The worldwide number of victims of intentional homicide was estimated to be between 4.6 and 6.8 per 100,000 people in 2014, a slight decrease with respect to previous years. Yet during that period, the homicide rate in developing countries was twice that in developed countries, and increased in the least developed countries. Moreover, despite the lack of harmonized data, fatalities and injuries related to armed conflict appear to be increasing in some countries, causing unprecedented population displacements and enormous humanitarian needs.Various forms of violence against children are pervasive, including discipline that relies on physical punishment and psychological aggression. In all but 7 of 73 countries and areas with available survey data from 2005 to 2015, more than half of children between the ages of 1 and 14 were subjected to some form of psychological aggression and/or physical punishment at home. In Northern Africa, the share was more than 90 per cent. Globally, the share of girls and boys among victims of human trafficking (21 per cent and 13 per cent, respectively) peaked in 2011. By 2014, the figures had dropped to 18 per cent and 7 per cent, respectively, but were still almost twice the levels recorded for 2004. Sexual violence is one of the most unsettling of childrens rights violations. Yet underreporting and the lack of comparable data limit understanding of the full extent of the problem. Survey data from 31 low- and middle-income countries suggest that the proportion of women aged between 18 and 29 who experienced sexual violence for the first time before the age of 18 varies widely, ranging from zero to 16 per cent. Comparable data on the experiences of men are only available for five countries, but values are lower than those reported among women in the same countries. Progress with respect to the rule of law and access to justice is mixed. Globally, the proportion of people held in detention without sentencing decreased slightly, from 32 per cent of total detainees in 2003-2005 to 30 per cent in 2012-2014. However, the percentage for developing regions has consistently been more than two times that of developed regions. In Southern Asia, for instance, more than 2 out of 3 prisoners remained unsentenced in 2012-2014, despite some improvement over the data available for the period 2003 to 2005. Among victims of robbery, between one quarter and one half reported the crime to the police, in 27 countries with available data. The data suggest a significant gap in citizens access to and trust in authorities. Although official data on the prevalence of bribery are limited, figures from 19 countries indicate that the rate of prevalence of bribery may reach as high as 50 per cent among citizens who had contact with public officials, undermining trust in state institutions.Registering children at birth is a first step in securing recognition before the law and safeguarding individual rights and access to justice. Despite recent progress, the births of more than 1 in 4 children under the age of 5 worldwide have not been recorded. In sub-Saharan Africa, over half (54 per cent) of children have not been registered by their fifth birthday. Globally, children living in urban areas are around 1.5 times more likely to be registered than their rural counterparts. In most regions, birth registration rates tend to be highest among the richest 20 per cent of the population. Efforts are under way to make national and international institutions more effective, inclusive and transparent. Over the past 10 years, nearly two thirds of 144 countries with available data were able to plan their national budgets effectively (where final expenses remained within 10 per cent of original budgets). Voting rights assigned to various groups of countries in international institutions is one indication of inclusivity at the international level. For example, while developing countries account for 63 per cent of voting rights in the African Development Bank, this figure is only 35 per cent in the International Monetary Fund and 38 per cent in the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development of the World Bank Group. A free press is closely linked to access to information and the protection of human rights, but the trend in this regard is discouraging. The number of journalists killed increased from 65 in 2010 to 114 in 2015, despite the fact that, by 2013, 90States had adopted laws on freedom of and/or access to information.The proportion of countries with national human rights institutions has doubled over the past 15 years, reaching 35.5 per cent by the end of 2015. The share of such institutions that are compliant with the principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights (Paris Principles) (adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 48/134) was highest in developed regions (46 per cent) and in Latin America and the Caribbean (41 per cent). 
Goal 16. Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels


20.	Violent conflicts have increased in recent years, while homicides have declined slowly and more citizens around the world have better access to justice. A few high-intensity armed conflicts are causing large numbers of civilian casualties. Progress promoting peace and justice, together with effective, accountable and inclusive institutions, remains uneven across and within regions. 
		In 2015, between 5.2 persons and 6.7 persons per 100,000 persons worldwide were victims of intentional homicide. While the homicide rate has declined over the past decade, people in some countries located in Latin America, subSaharan Africa and Asia face increased risk of intentional murder. 
		Various forms of violence against children persist, including discipline that relies on physical punishment and psychological aggression. In 76 countries (most are developing countries) with available data from 2005 to 2016, about 8 in 10 children from 1 to 14 years of age were subjected to some form of psychological aggression and/or physical punishment on a regular basis.
		Countries have made solid progress in terms of detecting victims of trafficking in persons, as reflected by the increasing number of detected victims over the last decade. Globally, more women and girls than men and boys were identified as victims of trafficking in 2014. However, the share of women and girls has slowly retreated, from 84 per cent in 2004 to 71 per cent in 2014. While the share of victims trafficked for sexual exploitation has declined, the proportion of those trafficked for forced labour has increased. About 28 per cent of all trafficking victims detected in 2014 were children, with girls outnumbering boys (20 per cent and 8 per cent, respectively, of total victims). 
		Sexual violence is perhaps the most disturbing of childrens rights violations. Underreporting and a lack of comparable data limit understanding of the full extent of the problem. In 35 low- and middle-income countries with data, the proportions of women between 18 and 29 years of age who experienced sexual violence for the first time before 18 years of age ranged from 0 per cent to 16 per cent. 
		Rates of pretrial detention suggest that progress with respect to the rule of law and access to justice has been slow. Globally, the proportion of people held in detention without being sentenced for a crime has remained almost unchanged from 32 per cent of total prisoners in 2003-2005 to 31 per cent in 2013-2015  which indicates that substantive progress has not been achieved in the ability of judicial systems to process and try the accused in a fair and transparent manner. 
		Opaque, burdensome and inefficient regulations and procedures nurture opportunities for corrupt officials to extract bribes or unofficial payments. In 2015, over 18 per cent of firms worldwide reported receiving at least one bribery payment request. The share of firms in low- and lower-middle-income countries totalled 25 per cent, compared to 4 per cent in high-income countries. 
		To provide a sound basis for development, government budgets should be comprehensive, transparent and realistic. While expenditure in nearly 2 in 3 countries was within 10 per cent of their original national budgets, more than 1 in 7 countries deviated by at least 15 per cent. Nevertheless, budget reliability has improved over time, with about 8 in 10 countries in Southern Asia and Eastern Asia and the Pacific showing improvement. 
		Birth registration is a first step towards safeguarding individual rights and providing every person with access to justice and social services. While many regions have reached universal or near universal birth registration, globally the average is just 71 per cent, on the basis of available country data reported from 2010 to 2016. Fewer than half (46 per cent) of all children under 5 years of age in sub-Saharan Africa have had their births registered.
		Legislation that calls for freedom of information has increased steadily, but slow or inefficient implementation of such laws remains a concern. More than 110 countries have adopted freedom of information legislation and policies. However, expert assessments suggest that 47 of those countries fall short of having clear legal provisions for exceptions to that right, while another 47 countries lack sufficient provisions for public education. 
		Independent national human rights institutions play an important role in ensuring that States deliver on their human rights obligations and that no one is left behind. By the end of 2016, 37 per cent of countries had a national human rights institution that was compliant with internationally agreed standards (the Paris Principles), while 57 per cent of countries had been reviewed for compliance by their peers. 
		Goal 16. Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels
Many regions of the world suffer critically from armed conflict or other forms of violence that occur within societies and at the domestic level. Advancements in promoting the rule of law and access to justice are uneven. However, progress is being made in regulations to promote public access to information, albeit slowly, and in strengthening institutions upholding human rights at the national level.Despite their detrimental and long-lasting impact, violent forms of discipline against children are widespread. Nearly 8 in 10 children aged 114 years were subjected to some form of psychological aggression and/or physical punishment at home on a regular basis in 81 countries (primarily developing countries), with available data from 2005 to 2017.More than 570 different trafficking in persons flows were detected from 2012 to 2014, affecting all regions and many involving moving from lower- to higher-income countries. In 2014, the majority of detected victims of trafficking were women and girls (71 per cent) and about 28 per cent (20 per cent girls and 8 per cent boys) were children. In sub-Saharan Africa, 64 per cent of detected victims were children. Over 90 per cent of victims detected were trafficked for sexual exploitation and forced labour.Globally, the proportion of prisoners held in detention without being sentenced for a crime has remained almost constant in the last decade (32 per cent in 20032005 and 31 per cent in 20142016). Some progress has been made in parts of Asia and in sub-Saharan Africa.Globally, almost one in five firms are exposed to a bribe request when dealing with regulatory and utility transactions, with a regional variation from fewer than 10 per cent of firms in North America and Latin America and the Caribbean to 28 per cent in Central Asia and Southern Asia and in Eastern Asia and South-Eastern Asia. Birth registration plays a primary role in ensuring individual rights and access to justice and social services. Even if many regions have reached universal or near universal birth registration, globally the average is just 73 per cent. Fewer than half (46 per cent) of all children under five in sub-Saharan Africa have had their births registered.At least 1,019 human rights defenders, journalists and trade unionists have been killed in 61 countries across the world since 2015. This is equivalent to one person killed every day while working to inform the public and build a world free from fear and want. Among these victims were environmental defenders, indigenous peoples, community and labour leaders, minority rights advocates, reporters and bloggers.Freedom-of-information laws and policies have been adopted by 116 countries, with at least 25 countries adopting such laws over the past five years. Expert assessments, however, suggest that implementation remains a challenge. Among the 109 countries with implementation data, only 76 had sufficient provisions for requesting procedures, including those relating to clear and relatively simple procedures; clear and reasonable maximum timelines; and assistance provided by public officials to requesters. More than half of countries (116 out of 197) had a national human rights institution that had been reviewed for compliance with the internationally agreed standards (the Paris Principles) by their peers since 1998. Only 75 out of these 116 countries have fully compliant national human rights institutions.
