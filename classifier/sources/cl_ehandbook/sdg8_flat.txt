Indicator 8.1.1: Annual growth rate of real GDP per capita
Target 8.1: Sustain per capita economic growth in accordance with national circumstances and, in particular, at least 7 per cent gross domestic product growth per annum in the least developed countries
Goal 8: Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all 
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the percentage change in the real GDP per capita between two consecutive years. 
Concepts:
GDP is the measure of the monetary value of final goods and services which are produced in an economic territory/country in a given time period.  It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of produced assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. It can be measured either by:
(1)    The expenditure method – the sum of expenditures on final consumption, gross capital formation and net exports; or
(2)    The production method – the value of final outputs minus any intermediate consumption, plus the net taxes (taxes minus subsidies); or
(3)    The income approach – the sum of compensation of employees, gross operating surplus, gross mixed incomes and the net taxes on both production and imports. 
Real GDP is GDP adjusted for price changes using the ratio of prices in the current year to the prices in a given base year. 
Real GDP per capita is real GDP dividing by the population of a country. 
The population of a country may comprise either all usual residents of the country or all persons present in the country at the time of a population census. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
Measuring the annual growth rate of real GDP per capita allows for directly tracking target 8.1. It also serves as a proxy for the average standard of living of residents in a country. 
A positive percentage change in annual real GDP per capita can be interpreted as an increase in the average standard of living of the residents in a country.
Data Sources and Collection Method
GDP is calculated as part of the compilation of the national accounts data of a country.  The national accounts and population data for a country are generally compiled by the statistical authorities of a country (Statistical Office, Central Bank, relevant Ministries etc.) The underlying data for compiling the national accounts and GDP, can come from either statistical surveys or administrative sources. The survey method collects data using nationally representative business/enterprise surveys, household budget surveys and consumer price surveys etc. Administrative data sources are government expenditures and revenues, tax declarations, balance of payments, vehicle registration, employment data etc. The international statistical standard for compiling the national accounts of a country is the System of National Accounts 2008 (2008 SNA), which provides detailed guidance on the calculation of the GDP, see: https://unstats.un.org/unsd/nationalaccount/sna2008.asp. Additional guidance is also provided in the following publications: National Accounts: A practical introduction, see: https://unstats.un.org/unsd/publication/SeriesF/seriesF_85.pdf 
Understanding National Accounts, see: http://www.oecd.org/sdd/UNA-2014.pdf 
Essential SNA: Building the basics, see: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3859598/5937349/KS-GQ-14-008-EN.PDF/dead3c43-51bb-4833-b4c5-f2f0d951bc52 
Population statistics are obtained from censuses and demographic surveys. The Principles and Recommendations for Population and Housing Censuses provide international principles and recommendations for conducting population censuses, see: https://unstats.un.org/unsd/publication/seriesM/Series_M67rev3en.pdf . 
The publication World Population Prospects The 2017 Revision, Methodology of the United Nations Population Estimates and Projections provides guidance on population estimates, see: https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Publications/Files/WPP2017_Methodology.pdf
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
In order to calculate the annual growth rate of real GDP per capita the following steps need to be taken: 
Step 1: Divide the real GDP for year t and t+1 with the total population of the country in the respective years to get the real GDP per capita for the two consecutive years. 
￼
where,
Gt is the real GDP per capita for the year t; and
Gt+1 is the real GDP per capita for the year t+1. 
Step 2:The annual growth rate of real GDP per capita is then calculated as follows:  
￼
Comments and limitations:
Although countries or areas calculate GDP using the common principles and recommendations in the United Nations System of National Accounts (SNA), there are still issues with the international comparability of GDP estimates due to countries potentially using different versions of the SNA (e.g. 1968, 1993, or 2008) or different degrees of coverage of informal and non-observed economic activities in the GDP estimates. 
A frequently cited limitation of GDP is that it does not account for the social and environmental costs of production. It is, however, designated as a measure of the level of overall well-being.

Data Disaggregation
It is possible to disaggregate the country data by region, economic sectors, if the underlying regional data is available and are consistent with the national accounts. 
Indicator 8.10.1: Number of commercial bank branches per 100,000 adults (b) number of automated teller machines (ATMs) per 100,000 adults
Target 8.10: Strengthen the capacity of domestic financial institutions to encourage and expand access to banking, insurance and financial services for all.
Goal 8: Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator has two components. They are defined as the number of (a) commercial bank branches per 100,000 adults, and (b) number of automated teller machines (ATMs) per 100,000 adults in a country. 
Concepts:
The first component of the indicator refers to the number of commercial banks branches as reported by the Central Bank or the main financial regulator. To make the indicator meaningful for cross-country comparison, the number of commercial banks branches are scaled per 100,000 adults. 
The second component of the indicators refers to the number of ATMs in the country for all types of financial institutions including commercial banks, non-deposit taking microfinance institutions, deposit taking micro finance institutions, credit union and financial cooperatives as reported by the Central Bank or the main financial regulator. To make the indicator meaningful for cross-country comparison, the number of ATMs are scaled per 100,000 adults. 
The adult population is defined as those aged 15 and above.  
Rationale and Interpretation:
Access to and use of formal financial services is essential. Services such as savings, insurance, payments, credit and remittances allow people to manage their lives, plan and pay expenses, grow their businesses and improve their overall welfare. As banks remain one of the key institutions for access to formal financial services, having an accessible bank branch is an important initial point of access to financial services and therefore use of them. Bank branches are complemented by other important points of access such as automated teller machines of all formal financial institutions, which can extend financial services to remote locations. Therefore, this indicator is a direct measure of progress on access to financial services and banking.
Data Sources and Collection Method
The Central Bank or the main financial regulator collects data from the financial institutions and service providers in the country and reports aggregates.

Indicator 8.2.1: Annual growth rate of real GDP per employed person
Target 8.2: Achieve higher levels of economic productivity through diversification, technological upgrading and innovation, including through a focus on high-value added and labour-intensive sectors
Goal 8: Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator conveys the growth rate of real GDP produced by unit of labour input. This indicator is generally defined as the percentage change in the real GDP (at base year constant prices) per employed person—also known as labour productivity—between two consecutive years.
However, labour input more widely refers to all persons who contribute to the production of goods and services within the SNA production boundary, not only the employed. In fact, according to the new standards laid out in the 2013 Resolution concerning statistics of work, employment and labour underutilization, the labour input contributing to the GDP comprises not only employment (work done for use by others for pay or profit) but also own-use production of goods, unpaid trainee work and some forms of volunteer work as well. 
Concepts:
GDP is the measure of the monetary value of final goods and services that are bought by the final user, which are produced in an economic territory/country in a given time year.  It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. It can be measured either by:
(1)    The expenditure method – the sum of expenditures on final consumption, gross capital formation and net exports; or
(2)    The production method – the value of final outputs minus any intermediate consumption, plus the net taxes (taxes minus subsidies); or
(3)    The income approach – the sum of compensation of employees, gross operating surplus, gross mixed incomes and the net taxes on both production and imports. 
Real GDP is the GDP figure adjusted for price changes (i.e. inflation or deflation). It is adjusted using the ratio of prices in the current year to the prices in a given base year. 
Employment comprises all persons of working age who during a short reference period (one week), were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit. The working-age population is usually defined as persons aged 15 and above. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
Real GDP per unit of labour input (in terms of one person contributing to the production of goods and services within the SNA production boundary, or as more generally defined, in terms of one employed person) is a measure of labour productivity. When monitored over time, it offers insight into labour productivity growth, and on the evolution, efficiency and quality of human capital in the production process. Economic growth in a country can be ascribed either to increased labour input or to more effective work by those who are employed. This indicator casts light on the latter effect, being therefore a key measure of economic performance. Labour productivity (and growth) estimates can support the formulation of labour market policies and monitor their effects. They can also contribute to the understanding of how labour market performance affects living standards.
Data Sources and Collection Method
The data for GDP that is used for indicator is compiled by the national statistical offices, ministries of finance or economy, as part of their national accounting activities. 
The employment or labour input data are derived from labour force or other nationally representative household surveys with an appropriate module, which are also conducted by the national statistical offices or the ministries of labour. In the absence of such surveys, establishment/firm surveys, administrative records or other official estimates based on reliable sources such as the population census can be used. It is important to note, however, that establishment surveys only capture the number of jobs, and not the number of persons employed, and may also be limited to the formal sector. 
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
First, GDP per employed person is obtained by dividing the GDP for that year by the number of employed persons in the country in the same year using the formula: 
￼
Then, the annual growth rate per employed person of real GDP for the year t ￼ is calculated as follows: 
￼
where,
LPt is the real GDP per employed person (labour productivity) at constant base year prices for the year t; and
LPt-1 is the real GDP per employed person (labour productivity) at constant base year prices for the year t-1. 
Comments and limitations:
GDP is mostly calculated based on the SNA. However, there are still significant problems in international consistency of national accounts estimates due to factors such as differences in the treatment of output in services sectors, differences in methods used to correct output measures for price changes (in particular, the use of different weighting systems to obtain deflators) and differences in the degree of coverage of informal economic activities. 
The degree of reliability of the estimates on employment or labour input is also dependent on the degree of coverage of all productive activities, and particularly informal activities, by the statistical source used.

Data Disaggregation
Disaggregation is not required for this indicator. However, disaggregation by region and economic sectors can be beneficial.
Indicator 8.3.1: Proportion of informal employment in non-agriculture employment, by sex
Target 8.3: Promote development-oriented policies that support productive activities, decent job creation, entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation, and encourage the formalization and growth of micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises, including through access to financial services
Goal 8: Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the percentage of non-agricultural employment that is classified as informal employment. 
Concepts: 
Employment comprises all persons of working age who during a short reference period (one week), were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit. The working-age population is usually defined as all persons aged 15 and above. 
Informal employment comprises persons who in their main or secondary jobs were in one of the following categories:
	•	Own-account workers, employers and members of producers’ cooperatives employed in their own informal sector enterprises (the characteristics of the enterprise determine the informal nature of their jobs);
	•	Contributing family workers, regardless of whether they work in formal or informal sector enterprises (they usually do not have explicit, written contracts of employment, and are not subject to labour legislation, social security regulations, collective agreements, etc., which determines the informal nature of their jobs);
	•	Employees holding informal jobs, whether employed by formal sector enterprises, informal sector enterprises, or as paid domestic workers by households (employees are considered to have informal jobs if their employment relationship is, in law or in practice, not subject to national labour legislation, income taxation, social protection or entitlement to certain employment benefits);[1]  Operational criteria used by countries to define informal jobs of employees include the lack of coverage by the social security system, the lack of entitlement to paid annual or sick leave and the lack of a written employment contract.
	•	Producers of goods exclusively for own final use by their household (e.g. subsistence farming[2], fetching water, collecting firewood, etc.).  Operational criteria used by countries to define informal jobs of employees include the lack of coverage by the social security system, the lack of entitlement to paid annual or sick leave and the lack of a written employment contract.
An enterprise belongs to the informal sector if it fulfils the three following conditions:
	•	It is an unincorporated enterprise (it is not constituted as a legal entity separate from its owners, and it is owned and controlled by one or more members of one or more households, and it is not a quasi-corporation: it does not have a complete set of accounts, including balance sheets);
	•	It is a market enterprise (it sells at least some of the goods or services it produces); 
	•	The enterprise is not registered or the employees of the enterprise are not registered or the number of persons engaged on a continuous basis is below a threshold determined by the country. 
Non-agricultural activities are defined according to the latest revision of the International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC Rev.4). They correspond to sections B to U of the ISIC Rev. 4, that is, all sections except section A. Agriculture, forestry and fishing.
For more detailed information on informality definitions, please refer to the Resolution concerning statistics of employment in the informal sector, adopted by the Fifteenth International Conference of Labour Statisticians (January 1993), available at http://ilo.org/global/statistics-and-databases/standards-and-guidelines/resolutions-adopted-by-international-conferences-of-labour-statisticians/WCMS_087484/lang--en/index.htm, the Guidelines concerning a statistical definition of informal employment, adopted by the Seventieth International Conference of Labour Statisticians (November-December 2003) available at http://ilo.org/global/statistics-and-databases/standards-and-guidelines/guidelines-adopted-by-international-conferences-of-labour-statisticians/WCMS_087622/lang--en/index.htm and the ILO manual Measuring informality: A statistical manual on the informal sector and informal employment available at http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---dcomm/---publ/documents/publication/wcms_222979.pdf. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
Informal employment offers a necessary survival strategy in countries that lack social safety nets, such as unemployment insurance, or where wages and pensions are low, especially in the public sector. In these situations, indicators such as the unemployment rate and time-related underemployment are not sufficient to describe the labour market completely. Statistics on the informal economy are key to assessing the quality of employment in an economy, and are relevant to developing and developed countries alike. 
ILOSTAT indicator description for informality is available at: http://www.ilo.org/ilostat-files/Documents/description_IFL_EN.pdf  
Data Sources and Collection Method
The data for this indicator can be collected through labour force surveys or other nationally representative household surveys with a module on employment. These surveys should have sufficient questions to determine whether the respondent’s job is of formal or informal nature, or the formal or informal nature of the employing establishment. These surveys are conducted by the national statistical offices of countries or the ministries or bureaus of labour.
For information on national practices in terms of questions used to capture data on informality, refer to the ILO report Women and Men in the Informal Economy: A Statistical Picture (Third Edition, 2018).
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
The percentage of non-agricultural employment that is informal is calculated as follows: 
￼
Comments and limitations:
The variety of concepts, definitions and operational criteria used by countries to measure informal employment greatly hinders the international comparability of the resulting statistics. The ILO makes an effort to derive harmonized statistics on informal employment from national household surveys following standard definitions and criteria for as many countries as possible (available on ILOSTAT).
The scope of this indicator is limited to non-agricultural activities. However, to have a more comprehensive picture of the informal economy, statistics on informal employment that incorporates  both agricultural and non-agricultural activites can be helpful. 
Proxy, alternative and additional indicators: N/A
Data Disaggregation
In order to produce this indicator, employment statistics need to be disaggregated by formal/informal employment and by economic activity (agriculture/industry/services etc.). Beyond this, the indicator is required to be disaggregated by sex. 
Indicator 8.4.2:  Domestic material consumption, domestic material consumption per capita, and domestic material consumption per GDP
Target 8.4: Improve progressively, through 2030, global resource efficiency in consumption and production and endeavour to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation, in accordance with the 10‑Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production, with developed countries taking the lead
Goal 8: Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) is a standard material flow accounting (MFA) indicator and reports the apparent annual consumption of materials in a national economy. The indicator can also be expressed per capita and per GDP. 
Concepts:
Economy-wide material flow accounts (EW-MFA) provide an aggregate overview, in thousand tonnes per year, of the material flows into and out of an economy. EW-MFA cover solid, gaseous, and liquid materials, except for bulk flows of water and air. 
DMC measures the total amount of material directly used in an economy (i.e. excluding indirect flows). DMC is defined in the same way as other key physical indictors such as gross inland energy consumption. DMC equals Domestic Extraction plus imports minus exports. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
As a territorial and production-side indicator, DMC refers to the amount of material used in the production processes within an economy. DMC describes the physical dimension of economic processes and interactions. Per-capita DMC describes the average level of material use in an economy – an environmental pressure indicator – and is also referred to as metabolic profile.
Data Sources and Collection Method
Data for the calculation of the DMC is compiled by the relevant national agency such as the ministry of commerce, trade or industry, or the national statistical office. 
For Europe, Eurostat compiles Economy-wide material flow account data from countries. For other countries, DMC is based on official statistics and then standard rates are used to convert data into tonnes of extraction, imports and exports. This is done by type of material based on the following: the International Energy Agency (IEA) has detailed information on fossil fuels;  for biomass, major crops and crop products, livestock and animal products, forestry products and fish are available from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and for components that are difficult to measure directly, e.g. grazed biomass, the FAO will typically not have direct data, however data reported to the FAO for animal products or herd numbers is used as input data for making an estimate; for metal ores, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the British Geological Survey (BGS) collect data on metal production, and in some cases ore production with trade of metal ores from United Nations Comtrade database; and for non-metalic minerals the USGS and BGS have some data and where data is missing then it is based on data published by countries or in some cases a standard estimation of per capita consumption for countries with different per capita incomes.
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
It is calculated as direct imports (IM) of material plus domestic extraction (DE) of materials minus direct exports (EX) of materials measured in metric tonnes.
DMC= IM + DE- EX
UN Environment is publishing a global manual which should be released by July 2018.  This global manual is based largely on the EUROSTAT Economy Wide Material Flow Accounting compilation guide 2013. MFA accounting is also part of the central framework of the System of integrated Environmental-Economic Accounts (SEEA). More information on data sources and compilation is provided in the below section. 
DMC should be divided by the GDP and the population of the country to get standardized measures such as DMC per capita and DMC per GDP. 
Comments and limitations:
DMC cannot be disaggregated to economic sectors due to the fact that there is no way to link the consumption of materials to a particular economic sector. 
DMC and Material Footprint (MF) (indicator 12.2.1) need to be looked at in combination as they cover the two aspects of the economy: production and consumption. The DMC and MF reports the virtual amount required across the whole supply chain to service final demand. A country can, for instance have a very high DMC because it has a large primary production sector for export or a very low DMC because it has outsourced most of the material intensive industrial process to other countries. Analysing both of these production and consumption side indicators together gives a better understanding of the overall resource use patterns of a country. 
Proxy, alternative and additional indicators: No proxy is needed due to the excellent coverage. However, there is a need for additional country validation.
Data Disaggregation
DMC can be disaggregated by type of material and for the purpose of the SDGs, there are four proposed disaggregations of DMC: Biomass, Fossil Fuels, Metal Ores and Non-metalic minerals.
Indicator 8.5.1: Average hourly earnings of female and male employees, by occupation, age and persons with disabilities
Target 8.5: By 2030, achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including for young people and persons with disabilities, and equal pay for work of equal value
Goal 8: Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the mean hourly earnings of employees from paid employment, disaggregated by sex, occupation, age and disability status. 
Concepts:
Earnings refer to the gross remuneration in cash or in kind paid to employed persons, as a rule at regular intervals, for time worked or work done, along with remuneration for time not worked (i.e. annual vacation, paid time off or holidays). Earnings exclude employers’ contributions towards social security and pension schemes or any benefits received by employees under these schemes. 
Employees are those persons in employment holding the type of job defined as paid employment jobs (jobs where the incumbents hold explicit or implicit employment contracts which give them a basic remuneration not directly dependent upon the revenue of the unit for which they work). Employment comprises all persons of working age who during a short reference period (one week), were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit. The working-age population is usually defined as persons aged 15 and above. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
Earnings are a key aspect of quality of productive employment and living conditions. Information on hourly earnings disaggregated by various classifications (sex, age, occupation, disability status) provides some indication of the extent to which pay equality is respected or achieved.
Data Sources and Collection Method
There are several sources for earnings data. Establishment surveys conducted by the national statistical offices are generally the most reliable due to the high level of accuracy of earnings figures derived from the payroll. This is why establishment surveys are the preferred source of earnings statistics. However, the scope of data is limited to the coverage of the survey, which often excludes smaller establishments, agricultural establishments and the informal sector. 
Household labour force surveys, or other surveys with an employment module can provide earnings statistics covering all economic activities, establishment types and sizes. But the quality of data is very dependent on the accuracy of respondents’ answers. 
Earnings data can also be derived from a variety of administrative records. The quality of the data would depend on the robustness of methods underlying the registration processes, and the record’s coverage and scope.
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
Average hourly earnings of employees (AHEx,i)  can be calculated using the following formula:
￼
Where,
x is the relevant employee group such as, total,  men, women, in different age grounds or person with disabilities etc.; and
i is the  relevant industry.
Or 
￼
This indicator’s disaggregation is used to calculate the gender pay gap (GPG) as follows: 
￼
Where AHEmen and AHEwomen are the average hourly earnings of men and women respectively in a given country. 
Comments and limitations:
Statistics on earnings can come from a variety of sources, including establishment surveys, household surveys and administrative records, each type of source having a specific coverage, scope and characteristics. This makes international comparability difficult. 
The use of non-standard definitions and the heterogeneity of operational criteria applied further hamper cross-country comparisons.

Indicator 8.5.2: Unemployment rate, by sex, age and persons with disabilities 
Target 8.5: By 2030, achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including for young people and persons with disabilities, and equal pay for work of equal value
Goal 8: Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all 
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the percentage of persons in the labour force who are unemployed, disaggregated by sex, age and disability status. 
Concepts:
Persons in unemployment are defined as all those of working age who were not in employment, carried out activities to seek employment during a specified recent period and were currently available to take up employment given a job opportunity, where:
(a) “not in employment” is assessed with respect to the short reference period for the measurement of employment;
(b) to “seek employment” refers to any activity when carried out, during a specified recent period comprising the last four weeks or one month, for the purpose of finding a job or setting up a business or agricultural undertaking. This includes also part-time, informal, temporary, seasonal or casual employment, within the national territory or abroad;
(c) the point when the enterprise starts to exist should be used to distinguish between search activities aimed at setting up a business and the work activity itself, as evidenced by the enterprise’s registration to operate or by when financial resources become available, the necessary infrastructure or materials are in place or the first client or order is received, depending on the context;
(d) “currently available” serves as a test of readiness to start a job in the present, assessed with respect to a short reference period comprising that used to measure employment. Depending on national circumstances, the reference period may be extended to include a short subsequent period not exceeding two weeks in total, so as to ensure adequate coverage of unemployment situations among different population groups.
Employment comprises all persons of working age who during a short reference period (one week), were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit. 
The labour force corresponds to the sum of all persons employed and all persons unemployed. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
The unemployment rate is a useful (although insufficient) measure of the underutilization of the labour supply. It reflects the inability of an economy to generate employment for those persons who are actively seeking work. It is an indicator of the efficiency and effectiveness of an economy to absorb its labour force, and of the performance of the labour market. 
Short-term time series of the unemployment rate can be used to signal changes in the business cycle; upward movements in the indicator often coincide with recessionary periods or in some cases with the beginning of an expansionary period as persons previously not in the labour market begin to test conditions through an active job search.
Data Sources and Collection Method
The data for this indicator is collected through household-based labour force surveys, population census, and any other nationally representative household surveys with an appropriate employment module. Such surveys are generally conducted by the ministries or bureaus of labour or national statistical offices. 
Unemployment registers, under social insurance administrative systems, can also serve as instruments to collect data on unemployment levels, and used to supplement the information obtained by household surveys. 
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
The unemployment rate (U) is calculated using the following formula: 
￼
Comments and limitations:
The significance of the unemployment rate depends on context. It is not to be interpreted the same way universally. In the absence of unemployment insurance systems or social safety nets, persons of working age must avoid unemployment, resorting to engaging in some form of economic activity, however insignificant or inadequate. Thus, in this context, other measures should supplement the unemployment rate to comprehensively assess labour underutilization, such as the time-related underemployment rate or measures of the potential labour force In this regard, the 2013 Resolution concerning statistics of work, employment and labour underutilization recommends that more than one headline indicator of labour underutilization be used, among the following: LU1 (unemployment rate), LU2 (combined rate of time-related underemployment and unemployment), LU3 (combined rate of unemployment and potential labour force) and LU4 (composite measure of labour underutilization). 
Statistics for any given year can also differ depending on the number of observations − monthly, quarterly, once or twice a year, and so on. Among other things, a considerable degree of seasonality can influence the results when the full year is not covered. 
Lastly, the geographic coverage of the survey used as a source of unemployment data also has an impact on the comparability of results. A less than national coverage – urban areas, city, regional – has obvious limitations to comparability to the extent that coverage is not representative of the country. Unemployment in urban areas may tend to be higher than total unemployment because of the exclusion of the rural areas where workers are likely to work, although they may be underemployed or unpaid family workers, rather than seek work in a non-existent or small formal sector.

Indicator 8.6.1: Proportion of youth (aged 15-24 years) not in education, employment or training
Target 8.6: By 2020, substantially reduce the proportion of youth not in employment, education or training
Goal 8: Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the percentage of young persons (aged 15-24 years) not in education, employment or training, out of the total youth population. It is also called the ‘youth NEET rate’. 
Concepts:
Education, according to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED), is defined as organized and sustained communication designed to bring about learning. It comprises the following:
(1)    Formal education - education that is institutionalized, intentional, and planned through public organizations and recognized private bodies and, in their totality, make up the formal education system of a country.
(2)    Non-formal education - education that is institutionalized, intentional and planned by an education provider but is considered an addition, alternative and/or a complement to formal education. It may be short in duration and/or low in intensity and it is typically provided in the form of short courses, workshops or seminars. 
Employment comprises all persons of working age who during a short reference period (one week), were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit. 
Training is defined as a non-academic learning activity through which students acquire specific skills intended for vocational or technical jobs. Vocational training prepares trainees for jobs that are based on manual or practical activities, and for skilled operative jobs, both blue and white collar related to a specific trade, occupation or vocation. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
The youth NEET rate provides a broader measure of youth disengaged from productive activities than measured by only youth unemployment. It includes young discouraged jobseekers, i.e. those who are not actively seeking employment, as well as those who are outside the labour force due to other reasons such as engagement in household chores or disability.   
It is a direct measure of progress towards target 8.6.
Data Sources and Collection Method
The data for this indicator is collected through household-based labour force surveys, population census, and any other nationally representative household surveys with an appropriate employment module. Such surveys are generally conducted by the ministries or bureaus of labour or national statistical offices.
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
This indicator can be calculated using the following formula:
￼
where,
Y is the total number of youth;
YEmp is the number of youth in employment; and
YUET is the number of youth not in employtmet but in education or training.

The computation of this indicator requires reliable data on both the labour market status and the participation in education or training of young persons. The quality of such information is heavily reliant on the questionnaire design, sample size and the accuracy of respondents’ answers. 
In terms of the analysis of the indicator, in order to avoid misinterpreting it, it is important to bear in mind that it is composed of two different sub-groups (unemployed youth not in education or training and youth outside the labour force not in education or training). The prevalence and composition of each sub-group would have policy implications, and thus, should also be considered when analysing the NEET rate.

This indicator can be disaggregated by sex, urban/rural, age (within the youth age band) and level of educational attainment.
Indicator 8.7.1: Proportion and number of children aged 5-17 years engaged in child labour, by sex and age
Target 8.7: Take immediate and effective measures to eradicate forced labour, end modern slavery and human trafficking and secure the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labour, including recruitment and use of child soldiers, and by 2025 end child labour in all its forms
Goal 8: Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all
 
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the number of children (aged 5-17 years) reported to be in child labour during the reference period (usually a week prior to the survey). 
Concepts:
Child labour refers to the subset of children’s activities that is injurious, negative or undesirable to children and that should be targeted for elimination. Child labour is legally interpreted as per the ILO convention no. 138 (minimum age), ILO convention no. 182 (worst forms), and the UN convention on the rights of the child (CRC). For further information, see: Resolution concerning statistics of child labour[1], adopted by the Eighteenth International Conference of Labour Statisticians (2008).   
For measurement purposes, child labour is defined to include all persons aged 5 to 17 years who are engaged in one or more of the following activities during a specified time period:
(1)    Hazardous work, i.e. work which, by its nature or the circumstances in which it is carried out, is likely to harm the health, safety or morals of children, as defined by national law (18th ICLS paragraphs 20-31); (2)    Worst forms of child labour other than hazardous work, i.e. all forms of slavery or practices similar to slavery, commercial sexual exploitation of children and children in illicit activities., as defined by national law (18th ICLS paragraph 19); and (3)    Employment below the minimum working age, as defined by national law, excluding “light work” performed by children aged not less than 12 or 13 years (18th ICLS paragraph 32 to 35). 
Rationale and Interpretation:
Engaging and trapping children in labour compromises their future. Tracking statistics on child labour enables development of appropriate regulatory frameworks and policies that are required to curtail child labour practices. This indicator is a direct measure of progress on target 8.7.

[1] http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---stat/documents/normativeinstrument/wcms_112458.pdf 
Data Sources and Collection Method
Household surveys such as National Labour Force Surveys, National Multipurpose Household Surveys, UNICEF supported Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), ILO-supported Statistical Information and Monitoring Programme on Child Labour (SIMPOC), and World bank Living Standard Measurement surveys (LSMS) are among the most important instruments for generating information on child labour in developing countries.
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
The proportion of children of the age group a that are engaged in child labour (PCLa) is calculated as follows:
￼
where,
NCLa is the number of children in the age group a that are engaged in child labour;
TNCa is the total number of children in the age group a; and
 a can be any desired age group (i.e. 5-14 years, 5-17 years etc.) 
The measurement methodology used by the ILO in its global estimates on child labour[1], building on the 18th ICLS statistical definition, classifies child labour on the basis of the following criteria:
	•	Hazardous work for all children aged 5-17 years old
	•	Children aged 5-11 years old performing at least one hour of economic activities during the reference week;
	•	Children aged 12-14 years old performing more than 14 hours of economic activities during the reference week
	•	Worst forms of child labour other than hazardous work (forced labour, commercial sexual exploitation of children, children in illicit activities, etc.).
Comments and limitations:
Child labour estimates based on the standards set out in the ICLS are useful benchmarks but are not necessarily consistent with estimates based on national child labour legislation. ILO Minimum Age Convention, 1973 (No.138)  contains a number of flexibility clauses that leave determination of child labour thresholds (e.g. minimum ages, scope of application) to the discretion of competent national authorities. Moreover, the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (No. 182) explicitly leaves the responsibility to establish the types of work considered as hazardous to the national authorities. Therefore, there is no single legal definition of child labour across countries and thus, no single statistical measure of child labour consistent with national legislation across countries. 
Proxy, alternative and additional indicators:
If, depending upon national policies and circumstances, the general production boundary rather than the SNA production boundary is used for measuring productive activities by children, child labour will include, in addition to the three categories specified under the section titled ‘Concepts’, hazardous unpaid household services. For the sake of clarity, child labour estimated on this basis should be called “child labour (general production boundary basis” (18th ICLS paragraphs 36-37).

Data Disaggregation
It is required to disaggregate this indicator by sex and age.
For reporting at national level, it is recommeded to disaggregate this indicator by area of residence, other relevant geographic disaggregation, school attendance, measures of household income, industry and hours of work.
Indicator 8.8.1: Frequency rates of fatal and non-fatal occupational injuries, by sex and migrant status
Target 8.8: Protect labour rights and promote safe and secure working environments for all workers, including migrant workers, in particular women migrants, and those in precarious employment
Goal 8: Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the number of cases of fatal and non-fatal occupational injury per hour worked by the reference population during a given period. However, the most common practice in terms of calculation of occupational injuries indicators is the number of cases of fatal and non-fatal occupational injury per 100’000 workers in the reference group. 
Concepts:
Occupational injury is defined as any personal injury, disease or death resulting from an occupational accident. An occupational injury is different from an occupational disease, which comes as a result of an exposure over a period of time to risk factors linked to the work activity. Diseases are included only in cases where the disease arose as a direct result of an accident. 
Occupational accident is defined as an unexpected and unplanned occurrence, including acts of violence, arising out of or in connection with work which results in one or more workers incurring a personal injury, disease or death. It includes travel, transport or road traffic accidents which arise out of or during work. 
For additional clarifications on occupational accidents and injury, please see Resolution concerning statistics of occupational injuries from the 16th International Conference on Labour Statistics (ICLS 1998). 
According to the UN Recommendations on Statistics of International Migration, an international migrant is defined as any person who changes his or her country of usual residence. However, in practice, due to the difficulties of applying this definition for measurement, many countries choose to define individuals’ migrant status based on their country of citizenship or their country of birth. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
This indicator provides to monitor and identify trends in workplace safety. It helps:
(1)     to inform employers, employers’ organizations, workers and workers’ organizations of the risks associated with their work and workplaces, so that they can take an active part in their own safety;
(2)    to evaluate the effectiveness of preventive measures; to estimate the consequences of occupational injuries, particularly in terms of days lost or costs; and
(3)    to provide a basis for policymaking aimed at encouraging employers, employers’ organizations, workers and workers’ organizations to introduce accident prevention measures.
Data Sources and Collection Method
Statistics on occupational injuries can come from a variety of sources, including different types of administrative records, such as records of national systems for the notification of occupational injuries (labour inspection records and annual reports; insurance and compensation records, death registers), household surveys (allowing to cover informal sector enterprises and the self-employed) and establishment surveys. A combination of these sources can be used to improve data quality and coverage. These data are generally compiled by labour ministries, national insurance companies, and national statistical office. 
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
Fatal and non-fatal occupational injury rates are calculated separately as follows:
￼
If data on the number of hours worked is unavailable, then the number of workers in the reference population can be used instead to calculate the rate of fatal and non-fatal occupational injury per 100’000 workers in the reference group, as follows: 
￼
Comments and limitations:
Occupational injuries are often underreported, which means that occupational injuries statistics from administrative records or registry systems may be less than comprehensive. Proper systems are required to ensure best reporting and data quality. Double counting of cases of occupational injury can also occur when several registries (records from different agencies) are consolidated to have more comprehensive data. 
This indicator is very volatile, as major accidents or national calamities can significantly impact the derived estimates at a given point in time. Thus, it may be better to analyse the trends in the indicator, rather than the levels.

Indicator 8.a.1: Aid for Trade commitments and disbursements
Target 8.a: Increase Aid for Trade support for developing countries, in particular least developed countries, including through the Enhanced Integrated Framework for Trade-related Technical Assistance to Least Developed Countries
Goal 8: Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as gross disbursements and commitments of total Official Development Assistance (ODA) from all donors for aid for trade. 
Concepts:
The Development Assistance Committee (DAC) defines ODA as those flows to countries and territories on the DAC list of ODA recipients and multilateral institutions which are:
(1)    Provided by official agencies, including state and local governments, or by their executive agencies; and
(2)    Each transaction of which:
a. is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; and b. is concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25 percent (calculated at a rate of discount of 10%). 
All donors refer to DAC donors, other bilateral providers of development cooperation and multilateral organizations.  
Aid for Trade is captured in the OECD’s Creditor Reporting System (CRS) as follows:
‒         Economic infrastructure (transport and storage (CRS codes 210xx), communications (CRS codes 220xx) and energy (CRS codes 230xx)),
‒         Trade policy and regulations and trade-related adjustment (CRS codes 331xx)
‒         The trade development policy marker, which identifies trade development/activities which have trade development as an explicit objective within the “building productive capacity” category which is defined as banking and financial services (CRS codes 240xx) , business and other services (CRS codes 250xx), agriculture, forestry, fishing (CRS codes 31xxxx), industry (CRS codes 321xx), mineral resources and mining (CRS codes 322xx), and tourism (CRS codes 332xx)), 
See for reference: http://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/dacandcrscodelists.htm 
Rationale and Interpretation:
ODA for aid for trade to developing countries quantify the public effort that donors provide to developing countries for aid for trade.
Data Sources and Collection Method
A statistical reporter is responsible for the collection of DAC statistics in each providing country/agency. This reporter is usually located in the national aid agency, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or Finance etc. 
The OECD/DAC has been collecting data on official and private resource flows from 1960 at an aggregate level and 1973 at an activity level through the CRS (CRS data are considered complete from 1995 for commitments at an activity level and 2002 for disbursements). The Rio marker for biodiversity was introduced in 2002. 
The OECD/DAC Secretariat prepares and submits an annual questionnaire (at an aggregate level and at an activity level) to national statistical reporters, and they are responsible for collecting, validating and publishing these data. 
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
This indicator is calculated as the sum of all ODA flows from all donors to developing countries are marked by the aid for trade marker under the 331 series. 
Comments and limitations:
Data in the CRS are available from 1973. However, the data coverage, at an activity level, is considered complete from 1995 for commitments and 2002 for disbursements.

Data Disaggregation
This indicator can be disaggregated by donor, type of finance, type of aid, trade policy and regulations and trade related adjustment sub-sectors, etc.
SDG 8: Economic Growth

Roughly half the worlds population still lives on the equivalent of about US$2 a day with global unemployment rates of 5.7% and having a job doesnt guarantee the ability to escape from poverty in many places. This slow and uneven progress requires us to rethink and retool our economic and social policies aimed at eradicating poverty.

A continued lack of decent work opportunities, insufficient investments and under-consumption lead to an erosion of the basic social contract underlying democratic societies: that all must share in progress. Even though the average annual growth rate of real GDP per capita worldwide is increasing year on year, there are still many countries in the developing world that are decelerating in their growth rates and moving farther from the 7% growth rate target set for 2030. As labor productivity decreases and unemployment rates rise, standards of living begin to decline due to lower wages.

Sustainable economic growth will require societies to create the conditions that allow people to have quality jobs that stimulate the economy while not harming the environment. Job opportunities and decent working conditions are also required for the whole working age population. There needs to be increased access to financial services to manage incomes, accumulate assets and make productive investments. Increased commitments to trade, banking and agriculture infrastructure will also help increase productivity and reduce unemployment levels in the worlds most impoverished regions.

The global unemployment rate in 2017 was 5.6%, down from 6.4% in 2000.
Globally, 61% of all workers were engaged in informal employment in 2016. Excluding the agricultural sector, 51% of all workers fell into this employment category.
Men earn 12.5% more than women in 40 out of 45 countries with data.
The global gender pay gap stands at 23 per cent globally and without decisive action, it will take another 68 years to achieve equal pay. Womens labour force participation rate is 63 per cent while that of men is 94 per cent.
Despite their increasing presence in public life, women continue to do 2.6 times the unpaid care and domestic work that men do.
470 million jobs are needed globally for new entrants to the labor market between 2016 and 2030.
Goal 8 targets

Sustain per capita economic growth in accordance with national circumstances and, in particular, at least 7 per cent gross domestic product growth per annum in the least developed countries
Achieve higher levels of economic productivity through diversification, technological upgrading and innovation, including through a focus on high-value added and labour-intensive sectors
Promote development-oriented policies that support productive activities, decent job creation, entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation, and encourage the formalization and growth of micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises, including through access to financial services
Improve progressively, through 2030, global resource efficiency in consumption and production and endeavour to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation, in accordance with the 10-year framework of programmes on sustainable consumption and production, with developed countries taking the lead achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including for young people and persons with disabilities, and equal pay for work of equal value
By 2020, substantially reduce the proportion of youth not in employment, education or training
Take immediate and effective measures to eradicate forced labour, end modern slavery and human trafficking and secure the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labour, including recruitment and use of child soldiers, and by 2025 end child labour in all its forms
Protect labour rights and promote safe and secure working environments for all workers, including migrant workers, in particular women migrants, and those in precarious employment devise and implement policies to promote sustainable tourism that creates jobs and promotes local culture and products
Strengthen the capacity of domestic financial institutions to encourage and expand access to banking, insurance and financial services for all
Increase Aid for Trade support for developing countries, in particular least developed countries, including through the Enhanced Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical Assistance to Least Developed Countries
By 2020, develop and operationalize a global strategy for youth employment and implement the Global Jobs Pact of the International Labour Organization

30 million: Number of jobs required every year for new entrants to the labour market to keep up with the growth of the global working age population.
DECENT WORK AND ECONOMIC GROWTH: WHY IT MATTERS
To promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment and decent work for all.
Poverty eradication is only possible through stable and well-paid jobs. Nearly 2.2 billion people live below the US$1.90 poverty line.
How many people are unemployed?
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), 5.6 per cent of the global population were unemployed as of 2017. In 2018, the total number of unemployed people remains high above 192 million and it is harder to find decent jobs.
How many jobs are needed?
470 million jobs are needed globally for new entrants to the labour market between 2016 and 2030, just to keep up with the growth of the global working age population. Thats around 30 million per year.
So if they all got a job will extreme poverty end?
In addition to creating jobs, we also need to improve conditions for the some 783 million women and men who are working, but not earning enough to lift themselves and their families out of poverty.
In addition, women and girls must enjoy equal access to equal opportunities with men and boys for employment.
I have a job. Why does this matter to me?
Society as a whole benefits when more people are being productive and contributing to their countrys growth. Productive employment and decent work are key elements to achieving fair globalization and poverty reduction. In addition, unemployment can lead to unrest and disrupt peace if it is left unaddressed.
What does decent work mean?
Decent work means opportunities for everyone to get work that is productive and delivers a fair income, security in the workplace and social protection for families, better prospects for personal development and social integration.
It is also important that all women and men are given equal opportunities in the workplace.
A continued lack of decent work opportunities, insufficient investments and under-consumption lead to an erosion of the basic social contract underlying democratic societies: that all must share in progress.
Providing youth the best opportunity to transition to a decent job calls for investing in education and training of the highest possible quality, providing youth with skills that match labour market demands, giving them access to social protection and basic services regardless of their contract type, as well as levelling the playing field so that all aspiring youth can attain productive employment regardless of their gender, income level or socio-economic background.
Governments can work to build dynamic, sustainable, innovative and people-centred economies, promoting youth employment and womens economic empowerment, in particular, and decent work for all.
Local authorities and communities can renew and plan their cities and human settlements so as to foster community cohesion and personal security and to stimulate innovation and employment.
Goal 8. Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all
Sustained and inclusive economic growth is necessary for achieving sustainable development. The global annual growth rate of real GDP per capita increased by 1.3 per cent in 2014, a significant slowdown compared to 2010 (2.8 per cent growth) and 2000 (3.0 per cent growth). Developing regions grew far faster than developed regions, with average annual growth rates in 2014 of 3.1 per cent and 1.4 per cent, respectively. Labour productivity (measured by GDP per worker) spurs economic growth. Growth in labour productivity in developing regions far outpaced that of developed regions, especially in Asia. Between 2010 and 2015, labour productivity grew by 0.9 per cent per year, on average, in developed regions, while rising by 6.7 per cent per year, on average, in Eastern Asia, the region with the fastest growth. Despite rapid growth in some developing regions, labour productivity remains far higher in the developed regions. In 2015, the average worker in developed regions produced 23 times the annual output of an average worker in sub-Saharan Africa (which has the lowest labour productivity in developing regions), and 2.5 times that of an average worker in Western Asia (which has the highest labour productivity in developing regions). The global unemployment rate stood at 6.1 per cent in 2015, down from a peak of 6.6 per cent in 2009, mostly owing to a decline in unemployment in the developed regions. Unemployment affects population groups differently. Globally, women and youth (aged 15 to 24) are more likely to face unemployment than men and adults aged 25 and over. In all regions, except Eastern Asia and the developed regions, the unemployment rate among women is higher than that of men. In almost all regions, the rate of youth unemployment is more than twice that of adults.Although the number of children engaged in child labour declined globally by one third from 2000 to 2012 (from 246 million to 168 million), more than half of child labourers in 2012 (85 million) were engaged in hazardous forms of work. The incidence of child labour was highest in sub-Saharan Africa, where 21 per cent of children were employed as child labourers. Of all child labourers worldwide, 59 per cent were engaged in agricultural activities in 2012. While economic growth and employment are important for economic security, access to financial services is an essential component of inclusive growth. Between 2011 and 2014, the proportion of the worlds adult population with an account at a financial institution or a mobile money service provider increased from 51 per cent to 62 per cent, meaning that 700 million adults became account holders during this period. Financial exclusion disproportionately affected women and the poor. The proportion of women who are account holders is 9 percentage points lower than the proportion of men who are account holders. Moreover, the proportion of account holders among the poorest 40 per cent of households is 14 percentage points lower than among those living in the richest 60 per cent of households.In 2014, aid for trade assistance was $54.8 billion, an increase of almost 120 per cent over the period from 2002 to 2005. However, total commitments fell slightly (by $1 billion) in 2014 compared to 2013, driven mainly by a $4.7 billion drop in support for transport and storage. A total of 146 developing countries received aid for trade assistance in 2014, with lower-middle-income countries receiving 39.4 per cent of the total, the least developed countries receiving 26.3 per cent and upper-middle-income countries receiving 19 per cent. On a per capita basis, however, the least developed countries received $10 per capita, more than any other income group and more than twice the global average.
Goal 8. Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all


12.	Increasing labour productivity, reducing the unemployment rate, especially for young people, and improving access to financial services and benefits are essential components of sustained and inclusive economic growth. 
		The average annual growth rate of real GDP per capita worldwide was 1.6 per cent from 2010 to 2015, compared to 0.9 per cent in 2005-2009. In the least developed countries, the per capita growth rate accelerated from 3.5 per cent in 2000-2004 to 4.6 per cent in 2005-2009, before slowing to 2.5 per cent in 2010-2015. Overall average annual GDP growth in the least developed countries followed a similar trend, decelerating from 7.1 per cent in 2005-2009 to 4.9 per cent in 2010-2015, below the Sustainable Development Goals target of 7 per cent.
		Labour productivity (annual growth rate of real GDP per worker) globally has slowed from an average annual rate of 2.9 per cent from 2000 to 2008 to 1.9 per cent from 2009 to 2016. The slowdown represents a negative development for the global economy, with adverse effects on living standards and real wages. 
		The global unemployment rate stood at 5.7 per cent in 2016, with women more likely to be unemployed than men across all age groups. Youth were almost three times as likely as adults to be unemployed, with unemployment rates of 12.8 per cent and 4.4 per cent, respectively, in 2016. Moreover, in more than 76 per cent of countries with data, more than 1 in 10 youth are neither in the educational system nor working. Young women are more likely than young men to fall into that category in almost 70 per cent of countries with data.
		While the number of children from 5 to 17 years of age who are working has declined from 246 million in 2000 to 168 million in 2012, child labour remains a serious concern. More than half of child labourers (85 million children) participate in hazardous work and 59 per cent of them work in the agricultural sector. Girls have made greater progress than boys, with the number of girls engaged in child labour declining by 40 per cent during the period 2000-2012, compared to a decline of 25 per cent for boys.
		Access to financial services enables individuals and firms to manage changes in income, deal with fluctuating cash flows, accumulate assets and make productive investments. Access to financial services through automated teller machines increased by 55 per cent worldwide from 2010 to 2015. Commercial bank branches grew by 5 per cent during the same period, with the lower growth explained by increased digital access to financial services. Globally, there were 60 automated teller machines and 17 commercial bank branches per 100,000 adults in 2015. From 2011 to 2014, 700 million adults became new account holders and the share of adults with an account at a financial institution increased from 51 per cent to 61 per cent. 
		After contracting slightly in 2014, aid for trade rose 5.4 per cent in real terms to reach $53.9 billion in 2015 owing to a recovery in commitments for trade-related infrastructure and further growth in support of banking and agriculture. Aid for trade commitments to the least developed countries increased in 2015 by $4.3 billion, reaching $17.2 billion. The Enhanced Integrated Framework, an aid-for-trade programme dedicated to those countries, started its second phase in 2016 and will run to 2022. Donor commitments to the Framework stood at $55.3 million in 2016, with $17.3 million already disbursed to the Trust Fund.
Goal 8. Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all
Although, globally, labour productivity has increased and the unemployment rate has decreased, more progress is needed to increase employment opportunities, in particular for young people, reduce informal employment and labour market inequalities (in particular in terms of the gender pay gap), promote safe and secure working environments and improve access to financial services to ensure sustained and inclusive economic growth.Globally, in 2016 real GDP per capita grew at 1.3 per cent, less than the average of 1.7 per cent growth rate recorded in the period 20102016. For the least developed countries, the rate fell sharply, from 5.7 per cent in the period 20052009 to 2.3 per cent in the period 20102016.Labour productivity at the global level, measured as output produced per employed person in constant 2005 United States dollars, grew by 2.1 per cent in 2017, the fastest growth registered since 2010. This was driven by strong productivity gains in Oceania, Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, but partially offset by modestly negative growth in Africa.Workers in informal employment have higher exposure to pervasive decent work deficits and a higher risk of being in working poverty. Globally, 61 per cent of workers were in informal employment in 2016. Excluding the agricultural sector, 51 per cent of all workers were in informal employment, with a higher prevalence registered among men (53 per cent) than women (46 per cent).A study of data from 45 countries shows that earnings inequalities are still pervasive: in 89 per cent of the countries, men earn on average more than women per hour worked, with a median gender pay gap of 12.5 per cent.The global unemployment rate was 5.6 per cent in 2017, down from 6.4 per cent in 2000, with a slower decline since 2009, when it reached 5.9 per cent. Youth are three times more likely to be unemployed than adults, with the global youth unemployment rate at 13 per cent in 2017.In half of the 74 countries with data available around 2016, over 17 per cent of young persons are not in education, employment or training, with no noticeable reduction in this share since the financial and economic crisis. Recent data from over 70 countries show that the prevalence of occupational accidents is still a cause for concern around the world, with a median of 4 fatal occupational injuries per 100,000 employees and a median of 911 non-fatal occupational injuries per 100,000 employees. From 2010 to 2016, the number of automated teller machines per 100,000 adults increased from 39 to 59 worldwide. Asia reported the highest increase. In contrast, over the same period, the number of commercial bank branches per 100,000 adults worldwide hovered around only 14.5, due in part to the expansion of non-bank financial intermediaries and the growth of digital financial services.Ownership of a financial account  whether through a financial institution such as a bank or a mobile money provider  is a basic measure of access to financial services. In high-income countries, almost every adult has an account, compared with only 35 per cent of adults in low-income countries. Women lag behind men on account ownership across all regions.In 2016, aid for trade commitments decreased to $51 billion from $55.2 billion in 2015, but was still more than double the baseline commitments of 20022005. The decline was highest in the energy sector (falling by $2.4 billion), banking and financial services (falling by $1.3 billion) and the agriculture sector (falling by $1 billion).
