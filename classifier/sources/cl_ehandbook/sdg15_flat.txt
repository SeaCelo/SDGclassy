Indicator 15.1.1: Forest area as a proportion of total land area
Target 15.1: By 2020, ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular forests, wetlands, mountains and drylands, in line with obligations under international agreements 
Goal 15: Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the proportion of forest area of the total land area of a country. It is represented as a percentage. 
Concepts:
Forest  is defined as land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ. It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use.  Additional detailed criteria are listed in FAO’s Forest Resource Assessment (FRA) 2020 Terms and Definitions Document available at: http://www.fao.org/3/I8661EN/i8661en.pdf. 
Total land area refers to the total surface area of a country excluding the area covered by inland waters, such as major rivers and lakes. Total land area of the reference year 2015 is used. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
The availability of accurate data on a country's forest area is a key element for forest policy and planning within the context of sustainable development. Forest area as a proportion of total land area can provide a rough proxy for the extent to which the forests in a country are being conserved or restored.
Data Sources and Collection Method
Forest area data are typically collected through field inventories and/or remote sensing. Field inventories are based on statistical sampling or aggregation of data collected for management inventories. Remote sensing has often an important role in these efforts either as an auxiliary data source which can be used to improve the efficiency of the field inventories, or as an input allowing direct assessment of land cover and its changes. Comprehensive guidance on how to establish a national forest monitoring system can be found in http://www.fao.org/3/a-I6767e.pdf 
Forest resources assessments are typically carried out by national forest authorities as part of statistical data collection activities of Ministry of Forestry, Agriculture or Environment or their combination.
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
The formula of the indicator is given as follows:
￼
Retrospective estimate can be applied if national borders have changed between reporting years. 
Comments and limitations: 
Assessment of forest area is carried out at infrequent intervals in many countries.  Although the increasing availability of remote sensing data has improved the possibilities for more frequent monitoring and reporting, the analysis of these data requires expertise and resources which may not be available. Furthermore, conversion of acquired land cover data to land use information as well as observing slow changes, such as forest regrowth, remain challenging. In addition, forest areas with low canopy cover densities (i.e. 10-30%) are difficult to detect and monitor with affordable remote sensing techniques.

Indicator 15.2.1: Progress towards sustainable forest management
Target 15.2: By 2020, promote the implementation of sustainable management of all types of forests, halt deforestation, restore degraded forests and substantially increase afforestation and reforestation globally
Goal 15: Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator measures progress towards sustainable forest management (SFM) The indicator comprises five sub-indicators: 
(1)    Forest area net change rate;
(2)    Above-ground biomass stock in forest;
(3)    Proportion of forest area located within legally established protected areas;
(4)    Proportion of forest area under a long-term forest management plan; and
(5)    Forest area under an independently verified forest management certification scheme. 
Concepts:
Sustainable forest management is defined as a “[a] dynamic and evolving concept [that] aims to maintain and enhance the economic, social and environmental values of all types of forests, for the benefit of present and future generations” (Resolution A/RES/62/98). 
Forest is defined as land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ. It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use. Additional detailed criteria are listed in FAO’s Global Forest Resources Assessment (FRA) 2020 Terms and Definitions Document available at  http://www.fao.org/3/I8661EN/i8661en.pdf. 
Above-ground biomass is defined as all living biomass above the soil, including stem, stump, branches, bark, seeds and foliage. In cases where forest understorey is a relatively small component of the aboveground biomass carbon pool, it is acceptable to exclude it, provided this is done in a consistent manner throughout the inventory time series. 
Protected Areas, are areas especially dedicated to the protection and maintenance of biological diversity, and of natural and associated cultural resources, and managed through legal or other effective means.  
Forest area within protected areas refers to forest area within formally established protected areas independently of the purpose for which the protected areas were established and includes International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) categories I-IV:
- Category Ia: Strict nature reserve
- Category Ib: Wilderness area
- Category II: National park
- Category III: Natural monument or feature
- Category IV: Habitat/species management area. 
Forest area with management plan refers to forest areas that have a long-term documented management plan, aiming at defined management goals, which is periodically revised. It may refer to forest management unit level or aggregated forest management unit level (forest blocks, farms, enterprises, watersheds, municipalities, or wider units). It also includes forest areas that are within protected areas with management plan. 
A management plan must include adequate detail on operations planned for individual operational units (stands or compartments) but may also provide general strategies and activities planned to reach management goals. 
Independently verified forest management certification refers to forest area certified under a forest management certification scheme with published standards and is independently verified by a third-party. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
The five sub-indicators contribute to the  measurement of progress in SFM in  various ways:
	1.	Trends in forest area are crucial for monitoring SFM. The first sub-indicator focuses on both the direction of change (whether there is a loss or gain in forest area) and how the change rate is changing over time; the latter is important in order to capture progress among countries that are losing forest area, but have managed to reduce the rate of annual forest area loss.
	2.	Changes in the above-ground biomass stock in forest indicate the balance between gains in biomass stock due to forest growth and losses due to wood removals, natural losses, fire, wind, pests and diseases.
	3.	The change in forest area within legally protected areas is a proxy for trends in forest biodiversity conservation and a clear indication of the political will to protect and conserve forest biodiversity.
	4.	The fourth sub-indicator looks at the forest areas that are under a long-term forest management plan. An increasing area under forest management plan is an indicator of progress towards sustainable forest management.
	5.	The fifth sub-indicator is the forest area that is certified by an independently verified forest management certification scheme. An increase in certified forest area provides an additional indication of progress towards sustainable forest management
Data Sources and Collection Method
The data for all sub indicators are collected through the officially nominated FRA National Correspondent network with one exception – data on forest certification data is produced by responsible certification bodies and delivered directly to the FRA after which it is sent to the countries for their validation.
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
Sub-indicator 1: forest area annual net change rate
This indicator is calculated using a compound interest formula to determine the annual net change rate.  
￼ 
Where:
A1 is forest area for year t1 and A2 is forest area for year t2
For example, if forest area for a country in year 2010 is 20 million hectares and year 2015 21 million hectares, the value of the annual net change rate becomes
A2/A1 = 21Mha/20Mha = 1.05
t2-t1 =2015-2010=5
q=[1.051/5 -1]  = [1.004988 -1] * 100 = 0.498756 %
Sub-indicator 2: Above-ground biomass stock in forest 
The formula is given as follows:
￼
 Sub-indicator 3: Proportion of forest area located within legally established protected areas
Percentage of forest area located within legally established protected areas is calculated as:
￼
Sub-indicator 4: Proportion of forest area under a long-term forest management plan. 
Percentage of forest area under a long-term forest management plan is calculated as:
￼
Sub-Indicator 5: Forest area under an independently verified forest management certification scheme 
The data for this sub-indicator are collected directly from the databases of each certification body provided to countries for validation.
Comments and limitations:
The five sub-indicators chosen to illustrate progress towards sustainable forest management do not fully cover all aspects of sustainable forest management. In particular, social and economic aspects are poorly reflected in the current set of sub-indicators. Furthermore, there are some data gaps, and the trends of some of the sub-indicators reflect different sets of countries. While the dashboard illustrates the progress on the individual sub-indicators, there is no weighting of the relative importance of the sub-indicators.

Indicator 15.5.1: Red List Index
Target 15.5: Take urgent and significant action to reduce the degradation of natural habitats, halt the loss of biodiversity and, by 2020, protect and prevent the extinction of threatened species
Goal 15: Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss 
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
The Red List Index is an index that measures changes in aggregate extinction risk across groups of species. It is based on the number of species in each category of extinction risk on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (IUCN 2015) is expressed as changes in an index ranging from 0 to 1. 
This is an indicator that is monitored at the global level. 
Concepts:
Threatened species are those listed on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species in the categories Vulnerable, Endangered, or Critically Endangered (i.e., species that are facing a high, very high, or extremely high risk of extinction in the wild in the medium-term future). 
Rationale and Interpretation:
The world’s species are impacted by a number of threatening processes, including habitat destruction and degradation, overexploitation, invasive alien species, human disturbance, pollution and climate change. This indicator can be used to assess overall changes in the extinction risk of groups of species as a result of these threats and the extent to which threats are being mitigated. 
The Red List Index value ranges from 1 (all species are categorized as ‘Least Concern’) to 0 (all species are categorized as ‘Extinct’), and so indicates how far the set of species has moved overall towards extinction. A downward trend in the Red List Index over time means that the expected rate of future species extinctions is worsening (i.e., the rate of biodiversity loss is increasing). An upward trend means that the expected rate of species extinctions is abating (i.e., the rate of biodiversity loss is decreasing), and a horizontal line means that the expected rate of species extinctions is remaining the same, although in each of these cases it does not mean that biodiversity loss has stopped. 
The name “Red List Index” should not be taken to imply that the indicator is produced as a composite indicator of a number of disparate metrics (in the same way that, e.g., the Multidimensional Poverty Index is compiled). The index is compiled from data on changes over time in the Red List Category for each species, excluding any changes driven by improved knowledge or revised taxonomy. 
The Red List Index calculates the extinction risk of a group relative to the worst-case scenario where all species of that group would be Extinct.
Data Sources and Collection Method
National agencies producing relevant data include government, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and academic institutions working jointly and separately. Data are gathered from published and unpublished sources, species experts, scientists, and conservationists through correspondence, workshops, and electronic fora. 
Data are submitted by national agencies to IUCN, or are gathered through initiatives of the Red List Partnership. From 2013–6, the Red List Partnership encompassed: BirdLife International; Botanic Gardens Conservation International; Conservation International; Microsoft; NatureServe; Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew; Sapienza University of Rome; Texas A&M University; Wildscreen; and Zoological Society of London.
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method: 
The Red List Index is calculated for a specific time period by first multiplying the number of species in each Red List Category by a weight (ranging from 1 for ‘Near Threatened’ to 5 for ‘Extinct’ and ‘Extinct in the Wild’) and summing these values. This is then divided by a maximum threat score which is the total number of species multiplied by the weight assigned to the ‘Extinct’ category. This final value is subtracted from 1 to give the Red List Index value. 
Mathematically this calculation is expressed as: 
￼
where Wc(t,s)  is the weight for category c at time t for species s.
The weights are: for ‘Critically Endangered’ = 4, ‘Endangered’ = 3, ‘Vulnerable’ = 2, ‘Near Threatened’ = 1, ‘Least Concern’ = 0. ‘Critically Endangered’ species tagged as ‘Possibly Extinct’ or ‘Possibly Extinct in the Wild’ are assigned a weight of 5; WEX = 5, the weight assigned to ‘Extinct’ or ‘Extinct in the Wild’ species; and N is the total number of assessed species, excluding those assessed as Data Deficient in the current time period, and those considered to be ‘Extinct’ in the year the set of species was first assessed. 
In many cases, species lists will change slightly from one assessment to the next (e.g., owing to taxonomic revisions). The conditions can therefore be met by retrospectively adjusting earlier Red List categorizations using current information and taxonomy. This is achieved by assuming that the current Red List Categories for the taxa have applied since the set of species was first assessed for the Red List, unless there is information to the contrary that genuine status changes have occurred. Such information is often contextual (e.g., relating to the known history of habitat loss within the range of the species). If there is insufficient information available for a newly added species, it is not incorporated into the Red List Index until it is assessed for a second time, at which point earlier assessments are retrospectively corrected by extrapolating recent trends in population, range, habitat and threats, supported by additional information. 
Comments and limitations:
There are four main sources of uncertainty associated with Red List Index values and trends:
(1) Inadequate, incomplete or inaccurate knowledge of a species’ status. This uncertainty is minimized by assigning estimates of extinction risk to categories that are broad in magnitude and timing;
(2) Delays in knowledge about a species becoming available for assessment. Such delays apply to a small (and diminishing) proportion of status changes, and can be overcome in the Red List Index through back-casting;
(3)Inconsistency between species assessments. These can be minimized by the requirement to provide supporting documentation detailing the best available data, with justifications, sources, and estimates of uncertainty and data quality, which are checked and standardized by IUCN through Red List Authorities, a Red List Technical Working Group and an independent Standards and Petitions Sub-committee; and
(4) Species that are too poorly known for the Red List Criteria to be applied are assigned to the Data In addition, the Red List Index does not capture particularly well the deteriorating status of common species that remain abundant and widespread but are declining slowly. 
Proxy, alternative and additional indicators: N/A
Data Disaggregation
The Red List Index can be downscaled to show national and regional Red List Indices, weighted by the fraction of each species’ distribution occurring within the country or region. These show an index of aggregate survival probability (the inverse of extinction risk) for all birds, mammals, amphibians, corals and cycads occurring within the country or region. The index shows how well species are conserved in a country or region to its potential contribution to global species conservation. 
This subset index is calculated as:
￼
where t is the year of comprehensive reassessment, u is the spatial unit (i.e. country), W(t,s) is the weight of the global Red List category for species s at time t (Least Concern =0, Near Threatened =1, Vulnerable =2, Endangered =3, Critically Endangered =4, Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) =5, Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct in the Wild) =5, Extinct in the Wild =5 and Extinct =5), WEX = 5 is the weight for Extinct species, Rsu is the fraction of the total range of species s in unit u, and Rs is the total range size of species s. 
The indicator can also be disaggregated by ecosystems, habitats, and other political and geographic divisions ,by taxonomic subsets, by suites of species relevant to particular international treaties or legislation,by suites of species exposed to particular threatening processes, and by suites of species that deliver particular ecosystem services, or have particular biological or life-history traits. In each case, information can be obtained from The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species to determine which species are relevant to particular subsets (e.g. which occur in particular ecosystems, habitats, and geographic areas of interest).
Indicator 15.6.1: Number of countries that have adopted legislative, administrative and policy frameworks to ensure fair and equitable sharing of benefits
Target 15.6: Promote fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources and promote appropriate access to such resources, as internationally agreed
Goal 15: Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the number of countries that have adopted legislative, administrative and policy frameworks for the implementation of the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization to the Convention on Biological Diversity (2010). 
This indicator is an international indicator and not monitored at the national level. 
Concepts:
The Nagoya Protocol, also referred to the Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS) is a 2010 supplementary agreement to the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) that aims to implement the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources, thereby contributing to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
In order for the Nagoya Protocol to be operational, certain enabling conditions are required to be met at the national level. Each party to the protocol is required to implement a set of legislative, administrative and policy frameworks (as appropriate) and report it to the ABS Clearing-House platform, as per Article 14 of the protocol. This indicator is a measure of progress on the number of party that have adopted said frameworks. 
Data Sources and Collection Method
The data for this indicator comes from the ABS Clearing-House, which is maintained by the CBD secretariat. Countries provide the information on ABS legislative, administrative and policy frameworks to the ABS Clearing-House directly by filling a form containing information and details about their frameworks.  
In order to ensure the accuracy of the information published in the ABS Clearing-House, all ABS frameworks are submitted to the clearing house by designated publishing authorities (a single authority for each country)
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
This indicator is calculated as the sum of the number of parties to the CBD who have submitted ABS legislative, administrative or policy measures to the ABS Clearing-House. 
Comments and limitations:
This indicator can be used to measure progress in adopting ABS legislative, administrative and policy frameworks over time. However, it does not assess the scope or effectiveness of ABS legislative, administrative and policy frameworks. 
The notion of framework suggests that there is a complete set of rules established on access and benefit sharing. However, it is difficult to have a predefined idea of what constitutes an ABS framework. In the context of this indicator, the publication by a country of one or more ABS legislative, administrative and policy measure in the ABS Clearing-House would be considered progress by that country on having an ABS legislative, administrative and policy framework.

Indicator 15.a.1: Official development assistance and public expenditure on conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and ecosystems
Target 15.a: Mobilize and significantly increase financial resources from all sources to conserve and sustainably use biodiversity and ecosystems
Goal 15: Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as gross disbursements of total Official Development Assistance (ODA) from all donors for biodiversity. This chapter of the e-handbook only covers the ODA part of the indicator. 
Concepts:
The Development Assistance Committee (DAC) defines ODA as those flows to countries and territories on the DAC list of ODA recipients and multilateral institutions which are:
(1)    Provided by official agencies, including state and local governments, or by their executive agencies; and
(2)    Each transaction of which:
a. is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; and
b. is concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25 percent (calculated at a rate of discount of 10%). 
All donors refers to DAC donors, other bilateral providers of development cooperation and multilateral organizations.  
Biodiversity refers to the OECD Creditor Reporting System’s (CRS) Rio marker for biodiversity. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
Total ODA flows to developing countries quantify the public effort that donors provide to developing countries for biodiversity.
Data Sources and Collection Method
The OECD/DAC has been collecting data on official and private resource flows from 1960 at an aggregate level and 1973 at an activity level through the CRS (CRS data are considered complete from 1995 for commitments at an activity level and 2002 for disbursements). The Rio marker for biodiversity was introduced in 2002. 
A statistical reporter is responsible for the collection of DAC statistics in each providing country/agency. This reporter is usually located in the national aid agency, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or Finance etc. 
The OECD/DAC Secretariat prepares and submits an annual questionnaire (at an aggregate level and at an activity level) to national statistical reporters, and is responsible for collecting, validating and publishing these data.
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
This indicator is calculated as the sum of all ODA flows from all donors to developing countries that have biodiversity as a principal or significant objective, thus marked with the Rio marker for biodiversity. 
Comments and limitations:
Data in the CRS data are available from 1973. However, the data coverage, at an activity level,  is considered complete from 1995 for commitments and 2002 for disbursements. The Rio biodiversity marker was introduced in 2002.

SDG 15: Forests, desertification and biodiversity

Forests cover 30.7 per cent of the Earths surface and, in addition to providing food security and shelter, they are key to combating climate change, protecting biodiversity and the homes of the indigenous population. By protecting forests, we will also be able to strengthen natural resource management and increase land productivity.

At the current time, thirteen million hectares of forests are being lost every year while the persistent degradation of drylands has led to the desertification of 3.6 billion hectares. Even though up to 15% of land is currently under protection, biodiversity is still at risk. Deforestation and desertification  caused by human activities and climate change  pose major challenges to sustainable development and have affected the lives and livelihoods of millions of people in the fight against poverty.

Efforts are being made to manage forests and combat desertification. There are two international agreements being implemented currently that promote the use of resources in an equitable way. Financial investments in support of biodiversity are also being provided.

The Lions Share Fund

On 21 June, 2018, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), FINCH and founding partner Mars, Incorporated, announced the Lions Share, an initiative aimed at transforming the lives of animals across the world by asking advertisers to contribute a percentage of their media spend to conservation and animal welfare projects. The Lions Share will see partners contribute 0.5 percent of their media spend to the fund for each advertisement they use featuring an animal. Those funds will be used to support animals and their habitats around the world. The Fund is seeking to raise US$100m a year within three years, with the money being invested in a range of wildlife conservation and animal welfare programs to be implemented by United Nations and civil society organizations.



Goal 15 targets

Forests

Around 1.6 billion people depend on forests for their livelihood, including 70 million indigenous people.
Forests are home to more than 80 per cent of all terrestrial species of animals, plants and insects.
Between 2010 and 2015, the world lost 3.3 million hectares of forest areas. Poor rural women depend on common pool resources and are especially affected by their depletion.
Desertification

6 billion people depend directly on agriculture, but 52 per cent of the land used for agriculture is moderately or severely affected by soil degradation.
Arable land loss is estimated at 30 to 35 times the historical rate
Due to drought and desertification, 12 million hectares are lost each year (23 hectares per minute). Within one year, 20 million tons of grain could have been grown.
74 per cent of the poor are directly affected by land degradation globally.
Biodiversity

Illicit poaching and trafficking of wildlife continues to thwart conservation efforts, with nearly 7,000 species of animals and plants reported in illegal trade involving 120 countries.
Of the 8,300 animal breeds known, 8 per cent are extinct and 22 per cent are at risk of extinction.
Of the over 80,000 tree species, less than 1 per cent have been studied for potential use.
Fish provide 20 per cent of animal protein to about 3 billion people. Only ten species provide about 30 per cent of marine capture fisheries and ten species provide about 50 per cent of aquaculture production.
Over 80 per cent of the human diet is provided by plants. Only three cereal crops  rice, maize and wheat  provide 60 per cent of energy intake.
As many as 80 per cent of people living in rural areas in developing countries rely on traditional plant-based medicines for basic healthcare.
Micro-organisms and invertebrates are key to ecosystem services, but their contributions are still poorly known and rarely acknowledged.
Goal 15 targets

15.1 By 2020, ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular forests, wetlands, mountains and drylands, in line with obligations under international agreements

15.2 By 2020, promote the implementation of sustainable management of all types of forests, halt deforestation, restore degraded forests and substantially increase afforestation and reforestation globally

15.3 combat desertification, restore degraded land and soil, including land affected by desertification, drought and floods, and strive to achieve a land degradation-neutral world

15.4 ensure the conservation of mountain ecosystems, including their biodiversity, in order to enhance their capacity to provide benefits that are essential for sustainable development

15.5 Take urgent and significant action to reduce the degradation of natural habitats, halt the loss of biodiversity and, by 2020, protect and prevent the extinction of threatened species

15.6 Promote fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources and promote appropriate access to such resources, as internationally agreed

15.7 Take urgent action to end poaching and trafficking of protected species of flora and fauna and address both demand and supply of illegal wildlife products

15.8 By 2020, introduce measures to prevent the introduction and significantly reduce the impact of invasive alien species on land and water ecosystems and control or eradicate the priority species

15.9 By 2020, integrate ecosystem and biodiversity values into national and local planning, development processes, poverty reduction strategies and accounts

15.A Mobilize and significantly increase financial resources from all sources to conserve and sustainably use biodiversity and ecosystems

15.B Mobilize significant resources from all sources and at all levels to finance sustainable forest management and provide adequate incentives to developing countries to advance such management, including for conservation and reforestation

15.C Enhance global support for efforts to combat poaching and trafficking of protected species, including by increasing the capacity of local communities to pursue sustainable livelihood opportunities

LIFE ON LAND
To sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation, and halt biodiversity loss.
Forests cover nearly 31 per cent of our planets land area. From the air we breathe, to the water we drink, to the food we eatforests sustain us.
Think about it. Around 1.6 billion people depend on forests for their livelihood. Almost 75 per cent of the worlds poor are affected directly by land degradation. Did you know that forests are home to more than 80 per cent of all terrestrial species of animals, plants and insects? And of the 8,300 animal breeds known, 8 per cent are extinct and 22 per cent are at risk of extinction.
Biodiversity and the ecosystem services it underpins can also be the basis for climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction strategies as they can deliver benefits that will increase the resilience of people to the impacts of climate change.
Forests and nature are also important for recreation and mental well-being. In many cultures, natural landscapes are closely linked to spiritual values, religious beliefs and traditional teachings.
The UN Forum on Forests Secretariat estimates that achieving sustainable forest management on a global scale would cost US$70-$160 billion per year. The Convention on Biological Diversity estimates that US$150-$440 billion per year is required to halt the loss of biodiversity at a global level by the middle of this century.
What would it cost if we dont correct the problem?
Biodiversity delivers multiple services from local to global levels, while responses to biodiversity loss range from emotional to utilitarian. For instance, insects and other pollen-carriers are estimated to be worth more than US$200 billion per year to the global food economy. Three-quarters of the top-ranking global prescription drugs contain components derived from plant extracts, which would be threatened. Natural disasters caused by ecosystems disrupted by human impact and climate change already cost the world more than US$300 billion per year. Deforestation and forest degradation results in loss of habitat for all species, a decrease in freshwater quality, an increase in soil erosion, land degradation and higher emissions of carbon into the atmosphere. In short, not taking action on forests impacts both the health of the planet and our communities.
Inevitably, we change the ecosystems we are a part of through our presencebut we can make choices that either affirm diversity or devalue it.
Some things we can do to help include recycling, eating a locally-based diet that is sustainably sourced, consuming only what we need, and limiting energy usage through efficient heating and cooling systems.
We must also be respectful toward wildlife and only take part in ecotourism opportunities that are responsibly and ethically run in order to prevent wildlife disturbance.
Well-managed protected areas support healthy ecosystems, which in turn keep people healthy. It is therefore critical to secure the involvement of the local communities in the development and management of these protected areas.

Goal 15. Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss
Preserving diverse forms of life on land requires targeted efforts to protect, restore and promote the conservation and sustainable use of terrestrial and other ecosystems. Goal 15 focuses specifically on managing forests sustainably, restoring degraded lands and successfully combating desertification, reducing degraded natural habitats and ending biodiversity loss.Between 1990 and 2015, the worlds forest area diminished from 31.7 per cent of the worlds total land mass to 30.7 per cent. The loss was mainly attributable to the conversion of forest to other land uses, such as agriculture and infrastructure development. Meanwhile, other areas were transformed into forests through planting, landscape restoration or the natural expansion of forest. Owing to the balance of the two processes and efforts to slow deforestation, the global net loss of forest area declined from 7.3 million hectares per year in the 1990s to 3.3 million hectares per year during the period from 2010 to 2015.To safeguard places that contribute significantly to global biodiversity, protected areas have been established and identified as key biodiversity areas. In 2014, 15.2 per cent of the worlds terrestrial and freshwater environments were covered by protected areas. The percentage of terrestrial key biodiversity areas covered by protected areas has increased, from 16.5 per cent in 2000 to 19.3 per cent in 2016. Over the same period, the share of freshwater key biodiversity areas that are protected has increased from 13.8 per cent to 16.6 per cent, and the share of mountain key biodiversity areas under protection has grown from 18.1 per cent to 20.1 per cent. The focus in Goal 15 on halting biodiversity loss comes at a critical time, since many species of amphibians, birds and mammals are sliding towards extinction. According to the International Union for Conservation of Natures Red List Index, amphibians are declining most rapidly in Latin America and the Caribbean, primarily as a result of the chytrid fungal disease, one of numerous wildlife diseases on the rise worldwide. The greatest extinction risks for birds and mammals are found in South-Eastern Asia, mainly owing to the conversion of lowland forests. However, their decline is not inevitable, with extinction risks for vertebrate species having been reversed in five small island developing States (the Cook Islands, Fiji, Mauritius, Seychelles and Tonga) as a result of conservation actions over the past several decades. Conservation efforts can also be thwarted by poaching and the trafficking of wildlife. Since 1999, at least 7,000 species of animals and plants have been detected in illegal trade, and the list of species under international protection continues to grow. Comparing the size of legal trade in wildlife products (about 900,000 transactions per year) to the quantity of wildlife seized (about 16,000 seizures per year) provides an indication of the scope of illicit wildlife trafficking. The value of legal and illicit wildlife products can also be compared. For example, the value of recorded seizures of Crocodylus genus represents between 0.4 per cent and 0.6 per cent of the value of legal protected exports of this species between 2009 and 2013, with no clear trend discernible.In 2014, bilateral ODA to support biodiversity amounted to $7 billion, an increase of 16 per cent in real terms over 2013. The two largest recipients of biodiversity assistance were the Philippines and India, which together received about $1 billion of the total aid.

19.	Progress in preserving and sustainably using the Earths terrestrial species and ecosystems is uneven. The pace of forest loss has slowed and improvements continue to be made in managing forests sustainably and protecting areas important for biodiversity. However, declining trends in land productivity, biodiversity loss and poaching and trafficking of wildlife remain serious concerns.
		The net loss of forest continues to slow and forest biomass stock per hectare is stable. More forests are being protected and areas under long-term management plans and voluntary certification have increased. From 2010 to 2015, the annual net loss of forest area globally was less than half that of the 1990s. The proportion of land area covered by forest decreased from 31.6 per cent in 1990 to 30.8 per cent in 2010 and 30.6 per cent in 2015. 
		Fifteen per cent of land is currently under protection, but that does not cover all areas important for biodiversity. Protecting key biodiversity areas is necessary to strengthen natural resource management and biodiversity conservation. From 2000 to 2017, average worldwide coverage of terrestrial, freshwater and mountain key biodiversity areas by protected areas increased from 35 per cent to 47 per cent, from 32 per cent to 43 per cent and from 39 per cent to 49 per cent, respectively. 
		As of 2017, 76 per cent of the worlds mountain areas are covered by some form of green vegetation, including forests, shrubs, grasses and crops. Green cover on mountains is lowest in Central Asia (31 per cent) and highest in Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand) (98 per cent). 
		From 1998 to 2013, about one fifth of the Earths land surface covered by vegetation showed persistent and declining trends in productivity. South America and Africa are most affected; in some cases, advanced stages of land degradation there are leading to desertification in dryland areas, particularly in the grasslands and rangelands. Land and soil degradation undermine the security and development of all countries. Reversing the effects of land degradation and desertification through sustainable land management is key to improving the lives and livelihoods of more than 1 billion people currently under threat.
		Biodiversity loss continues at an alarming rate according to the Red List Index. The extinction risk for corals is increasing most rapidly among all assessed species groups owing to the growing threat from climate change and local impacts. Chytrid fungal disease, another grave concern, is decimating many amphibian species and increasing their risk of extinction. 
		Wildlife poaching and trafficking continues to thwart conservation efforts. Illicit wildlife markets are complex and subject to rapid fluctuations. Demand for a given wildlife product can grow quickly, before the international community can react. In 2013, elephant ivory, rosewood and rhinoceros horn comprised over 60 per cent of total wildlife and timber product seizures. 
		The global community is committed to conserving biodiversity. Two international agreements aim at sharing the benefits from using genetic resources in a fair and equitable way. As of April 2017, 144 countries ratified the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture and 96 countries ratified the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization. 
		In 2015, bilateral ODA in support of biodiversity amounted to $8.8 billion, an increase of 39 per cent in real terms over 2014.

While the protection of areas in forest and terrestrial ecosystems is increasing and forest loss has slowed, other facets of terrestrial conservation continue to need accelerated efforts to protect biodiversity, land productivity and species and genetic resources.In 2015, forests covered about 4 billion hectares or 31 per cent of the worlds land area. The bulk of the worlds forest is comprised of natural forest (93 per cent), with the remaining 7 per cent planted. Despite a decrease in forest area over recent decades, the rate of forest loss has been cut by 25 per cent since the period 20002005. Most of the losses occur in sub-Saharan Africa, South-Eastern Asia and Latin America, and are mainly attributed to the expansion of agricultural activities. Promisingly, the proportion of protected forest area and forests under long-term management plans are increasing. The average proportion of important sites for biodiversity covered by protected areas continues to increase. As at January 2018, the average proportion of each key biodiversity area for freshwater, terrestrial and mountain biodiversity covered by protected areas was 44 per cent, 47 per cent and 48 per cent, respectively.About one fifth of the Earths land surface covered by vegetation showed persistent and declining trends in productivity from 1998 to 2013. Up to 24 million km2 of land was affected, including 19 per cent of cropland, 16 per cent of forest land, 19 per cent of grassland and 28 per cent of rangeland. In some cases, advanced stages of land degradation are leading to desertification in dryland areas, particularly in the grasslands and rangelands.Globally, in 2017, 76 per cent of mountain areas were covered by a form of green vegetation, including forests, shrubs, grassland and cropland, which tends to be positively correlated to the health of the mountains and their capacity to fulfil ecosystem roles. Changes in species extinction risk are measured by the Red List Index, incorporating data for more than 20,000 animal and plant species and indicating an increasing risk of extinction for species as the index moves toward zero. Since 1993, the Red List Index has declined from 0.82 to 0.74 globally. The primary drivers of this biodiversity loss are habitat loss from unsustainable agriculture, deforestation, unsustainable harvest and trade and alien invasive species.As part of the commitment by Member States to promote fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources, as at February 2018, 105 countries have ratified the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from Their Utilization to the Convention on Biological Diversity (up from 96 countries in 2017), and 50 countries have shared information on their access and benefit-sharing frameworks. To the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, there are now 144 contracting parties, and 22 countries have thus far provided information about their access and benefit-sharing measures.Illicit poaching and trafficking of wildlife continues to thwart conservation efforts, with nearly 7,000 species of animals and plants reported in illegal trade involving 120 countries. Strong international and local action has recently been taken to curtail the illegal trade in certain species, in particular ivory from elephants.In response to ongoing biological invasions, national Governments are increasingly committed to preventing introductions of invasive alien species and managing existing invasions. Since 2010, the percentage of countries that have enacted national legislation relevant to the prevention and management of invasive alien species has increased by 19 per cent.In 2016, bilateral ODA in support of biodiversity was $7 billion, a decrease of 21 per cent in real terms since 2015.
