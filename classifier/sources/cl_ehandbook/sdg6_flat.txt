Indicator 6.1.1: Proportion of population using safely managed drinking water services  
Target 6.1: By 2030, achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all
Goal 6: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the proportion of population using an improved drinking water source which is accessible on premises, available when needed and free from faecal and priority chemical contamination. 
Concepts:
Improved drinking water sources include piped water into dwelling, yard or plot (on premises); public taps or standpipes; boreholes or tube-wells; protected dug wells; protected springs; packaged water; delivered water and rainwater. 
A water source is considered to be accessible on premises if the point of collection is within the dwelling, yard, or plot. 
Available when needed implies that households are able to access sufficient quantities of water when needed. 
Free from  faecal or chemical contamination refers to the compliance to relevant national and local standards. In cases where such standards do not exist, reference is made to the WHO Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
This indicator adds additional normative dimensions of accessibility, availability and quality, interpreted as safely managed drinking water services, to the existing MDG metric that tracked use of ‘improved drinking water sources’. It is a proxy for measuring equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water. Improved drinking water sources are not necessarily safe, but are more likely to be protected from external contaminants than unimproved sources either by intervention or through their design and construction. Greater access to safely managed drinking water services is important as it contributes to lowering the incidence of many diseases throughout the world.
Data Sources and Collection Method
The underlying data for this indicator, use of improved drinking water sources, is a core indicator for most household surveys and censuses, and is regularly collected by national statistical offices. Household surveys and censuses currently provide information on types of drinking water sources, and also indicate if sources are on premises. These data sources often have information on the availability of water and increasingly on the quality of water at the household level, through direct testing of drinking water for faecal or chemical contamination. To further strengthen accuracy of water quality data, data obtained from the surveys can be compared against data on availability and compliance with drinking water quality standards (microbiological and chemical) from administrative reporting or regulatory bodies. 
Some of the nationally representative household surveys that typically collect information about water and sanitation include Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), Demographic Health Surveys (DHS), World Health Surveys (WHS), Living Standards and Measurement Surveys (LSMS), Core Welfare Indicator Questionnaires (CWIQ), and the Pan Arab Project for Family Health Surveys (PAPFAM). The survey questions and response categories pertaining to drinking water are fully harmonized between MICS and DHS. 
In addition, line ministries and water utility companies usually keep records based on the number and type of water supplies constructed or the number of piped household connections maintained. Provider-based data do not include what facilities are actually used, thus, they are only used for countries that have no survey or census data on access to or use of drinking water sources. However, such administrative sources may have much more data on water quality, especially for piped water supplies, than can be gained through household surveys.  
The WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP) estimates use of improved drinking water sources, as well as the extent to which such sources are located on premises, available when needed, and free from microbiological and chemical contamination, for each country. 
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
The percentage of population using safely managed drinking water services (PSMDWS) can be calculated as:
￼
where,
Nimproved is the number of people (or households) that are using improved drinking water sources;
Ppremises,available,freefromcontamination is the population-weighted proportion of improved drinking water sources that are located on premises, available when needed, and free from faecal and priority chemical contamination; and
NTotal is the total number of people (or households) in the country. 
Comments and limitations:
Data on availability and quality of drinking water are increasingly available through a combination of household surveys and administrative sources including regulators, but definitions are not always standardized. 
Proxy, alternative and additional indicators: N/A
Data Disaggregation
This indicator can be disaggregated by place of residence (urban/rural), socioeconomic status (wealth, affordability), inequality (subnational, disadvantaged groups, etc.) and service level (including no services, basic, and safely managed services).
Indicator 6.2.1: Proportion of population using (a) safely managed sanitation services, and (b) a handwashing facility with soap and water
Target 6.2: By 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations
Goal 6: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator includes two sub-indicators: (a) proportion of population using safely managed sanitation services and (b) proportion of population with a handwashing facility with soap and water. 
Proportion of population using safely managed sanitation services is currently being measured by the proportion of the population using an improved sanitation facility which is not shared with other households and where excreta are safely treated and disposed of in situ or transported and treated off-site. 
Concepts:
Improved sanitation facilities refer to sanitary facilities designed to hygienically separate excreta from human contact.  They include flush or pour flush toilets to sewer systems, septic tanks or pit latrines, ventilated improved pit latrines, pit latrines with a slab, and composting toilets. 
Hand-washing facilities are devices to contain, transport, or regulate the  flow of water to facilitate handwashing. This  indicator has been shown to be a better proxy for handwashing practice than self-reports of handwashing practice in surveys. 
Safely treated and disposed of in situ refers to non-sewered sanitation systems that store excreta and degrade organic matter through biological processes. Examples of safe treatment and disposal in situ include twin pit latrines, single pit latrines which are abandoned when full, and well-functioning septic tanks. 
Transported and treated off-site refers to practices of excreta (faecal sludge) being transported from the household to a different location for treatment and discharge. It includes both transportion via sewers or via other modes where septic tanks and pit latrines are being used. Secondary (biological) or higher treatment processes are counted for safely managed sanitation.   
Rationale and Interpretation:
Building upon the MDG target of providing sustainable access to basic sanitation, this indicator adds additional dimensions of accessibility, acceptability and safety. Furthermore, it also considers the safe management of faecal waste, as discharges of untreated wastewater into the environment create public health hazards. 
Handwashing with soap is widely agreed to be the top hygiene priority for improving health outcomes. The most widely-accepted and practical proxy for actual handwashing practice is the observation by enumerators in household surveys of the presence of handwashing facilities with soap and water in the household. This proxy has been shown to be a more reliable, valid and efficient measure than self-reported behaviour.
Data Sources and Collection Method
The underlying data for this indicator, use of improved sanitation facilities, is a core indicator for most household surveys and censuses, and is collected by national statistical offices regularly. Additional data on safe management of faecal wastes can be acquired from administrative records. Data on off-site treatment and disposal (e.g. in sewage treatment plants) is combined with data from surveys and censuses about the number of people whose excreta are removed off-site for treatment. Data on on-site treatment and disposal (e.g. in pit latrines or septic tanks) can come from both household surveys and administrative records.
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
The percentage of population using safely managed sanitation services (PSMS) can be calculated as: 
￼
The percentage of the population with access to hand-washing facilities with soap and water (PHW) can be calculated as: 
￼
where,
Noffsite is the number of people (or households) using improved sanitation facilities which are not shared and where excreta are transported off-site, treated and disposed of;
Nonsite is the number of people (or households) using improved sanitation facilities which are not shared and where excreta are treated and disposed of in situ;
NHW is the number of people (or households) that have access to handwashing facilities with soap and water on premises;
NTotal is the total number of people (or households) in the country 
Comments and limitations:
Presence of a handwashing facility with soap and water does not guarantee that household members consistently wash hands at key times, but has been accepted as the most suitable proxy. 
Proxy, alternative and additional indicators: N/A
Data Disaggregation
Data can be disaggregated by place of residence (urban/rural) and socioeconomic status (wealth, affordability). Disaggregation by other dimensions, such as, inequality (subnational, gender, disadvantaged groups, etc.) and service level (including no services, basic, and safely managed services) are also possible.
Indicator 6.4.2: Level of water stress: freshwater withdrawal as a proportion of available freshwater resources
Target 6.4: By 2030, substantially increase water-use efficiency across all sectors and ensure sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity and substantially reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity
Goal 6: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the ratio of total freshwater withdrawn by all major sectors to total renewable freshwater resources, after taking into account environmental flows requirements. It is expressed as a percentage. 
Concepts:
Total freshwater withdrawal (TFWW) is the volume of freshwater extracted from its source (rivers, lakes, aquifers) for the following three main sectors: agriculture, industries and services (including municipalities and domestic water withdrawal). It is estimated at the country level and on an annual basis. The category of freshwater withdrawal includes withdrawals from surface freshwater, groundwater and fossil groundwater. It does not include direct use of non-conventional water, i.e. treated wastewater, agricultural drainage water and desalinated water.  
Major sectors refer to agriculture, forestry and fishing (ISIC A), mining and quarrying, manufacturing, construction and energy (ISIC B, C, D and F), and all the services sectors (ISIC E, G-U) including water collection, treatment and supply industry, as defined by the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) – revision 4. 
Total renewable freshwater resources (TRWR) is the sum of internal and external renewable freshwater resources. Internal resources refer to the long-term average annual flow of rivers and recharge of groundwater, generated from endogenous precipitation, minus the overlap between surface water and groundwater. External resources refer to the part of a country’s long-term average annual renewable water resources that are not generated in the country, considering the quantity of flows reserved to upstream and downstream countries through agreements or treaties. 
Environmental flows requirements (EFR) are quantities and timing of freshwater flows required to sustain freshwater ecosystems and the human livelihood and well-being that depend on them. For the purpose of Indicator 6.4.2, the concept is limited to water volumes and excludes any considerations of water quality and resulting ecosystem services.  
Rationale and Interpretation:
This indicator measures the degree to which a country’s water resources are being exploited to meet its water demand. It measures the pressure on its water resources and therefore the challenge on the sustainability of its water use. Indicator 6.4.2 tracks progress towards Target 6.4 and addresses the environmental dimension of water scarcity. 
A low level of water stress indicates a situation where the combined withdrawal by all sectors is marginal in relation to the resources, and has therefore little potential impact on the sustainability of the resources or on the potential competition between users. A high level of water stress indicates a situation where the combined withdrawal by all sectors represents a substantial share of the total renewable freshwater resources, with potentially larger impacts on the sustainability of the resources and potential situations of conflicts and competition between users. 
Water stress occurs when the ratio is above 25 percent, which is the threshold of initial water stress. 
Data Sources and Collection Method
Data for this indicator are usually collected by national ministries and institutions having water-related issues in their mandate, such as ministries of water resources, agriculture, or environment. The computation of this indicator requires data from different sectors and sources. It is crucial that national coordination is in place to assure timely and consistent collection of data. However, one national institution should be identified and appointed with the task of compiling the indicator. That institution carries out an in-depth review of all the national, sub-national and basin unit sources of relevant data using available information resources. The most advisable units to be used are river basins, aggregated according to the circumstances of each country.  Data are mainly published within national water resources and irrigation master plans, national statistical yearbooks and other reports (such as those from projects, international surveys or results and publications from national and international research centres).
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
Water stress indicator is calculated using the following formula: 
￼
where TFWW is the total freshwater withdrawn; TRWR is the total renewable freshwater resources; and EFR is the environmental flows requirement component. All variables are expressed in km3/year. 
Comments and limitations:
Water withdrawal as a percentage of renewable water resources is a good indicator of pressure on limited water resources, one of the most important natural resources. However, it only partially addresses the issues related to sustainable water management. Supplementary indicators that capture the multiple dimensions of water management and combine data on water demand and supply, behavioural changes with regard to water use and the availability of appropriate infrastructure, should be defined or consulted simultaneously. 
Other limitations to this indicator might be represented by the difficulty to obtain accurate, complete and up-to-date data; large variations of sub-national data; lack of account of seasonal variations in water resources; lack of consideration to the distribution among water resources; lack of consideration of water quality and its suitability for use. 
Some of these issues can be resolved through disaggregation of the index at the level of hydrological units and by distinguishing between different sectors demanding water. However, care needs to be taken to avoid double counting due to the complexity of water flows. Other SDG 6 indicators also provide complementary information.
The data for this indicator should be collected annually. However, a reporting period up to three years can still be considered acceptable. 
Proxy, alternative and additional indicators: N/A
Data Disaggregation
This indicator can be disaggregated by sectors, and sectoral demand of water can be used to determine the proportion of contribution of economic sectors to the overall water stress.
Besides sectoral disaggregation, actions to reduce water stress can benefit from temporally and spatially disaggregated data. Spatial disaggregation of the indicator at subnational level is highly advisable wherever possible and is particularly important for larger countries or those with marked differences in climate or population density within their territory. It increases indicator’s usefulness for policy purposes.
Data at country level, averaged over one or more years, give an overview of situation of water stress. However, such overview may hide specific situations that only exist for part of the year, part of the country or both. Countries may decide to undertake detailed temporal disaggregation. This is especially relevant for countries with high intra-annual/seasonal variations in water resources and water use patterns.
Indicator 6.5.2: Proportion of transboundary basin area with an operational arrangement for water cooperation
Target 6.5: By 2030, implement integrated water resources management at all levels, including through transboundary cooperation as appropriate
Goal 6: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the percentage of transboundary basin area within a country with an operational arrangement for water cooperation with other countries. 
Concepts:
Transboundary basins include river and lake basins and aquifers shared between two or more sovereign states. For the purposes of this indicator, the extent of the basin is the catchment area for river and lake basins, and the surface area of transboundary aquifer systems. 
An arrangement for water cooperation is a bilateral or multilateral treaty, convention, agreement or any other formal arrangement between riparian countries that provides a framework for cooperation on transboundary water management. 
For any arrangement for water cooperation to be considered operational, all the following criteria need to be met:
(1)    There is a joint body, mechanism or commission for transboundary cooperation;
(2)    There are regular (at least once per year) formal communications between riparian countries in the form of meetings;
(3)    There is a joint or coordinated water management plan(s), or established joint objectives have been set; and
(4)    There is a regular (at least once per year) exchange of data and information between riparian countries.  
Rationale and Interpretation:
Most of the world’s water resources are shared. A large portion of the global population reside in -- and are directly reliant upon water supplied -- by shared river and lake basins or aquifers.  Developments, such as flow regulation or pollution, of these shared water resources may have impacts across sovereign borders. Specific agreements or other arrangements between co-riparian countries are a precondition to ensuring long-term, equitable and sustainable cooperation of these waters.
International customary water law - as reflected in the Convention on the Law of the Non-navigational Uses of International Watercourses (New York, 1997), the Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes (Helsinki, 1992), and the draft Articles on The Law of Transboundary Aquifers (2008; UN General Assembly resolutions 63/124, 66/104, and 68/118) - and the contemporary practice of watercourse States, points to the need for certain minimum requirements in order to foster transboundary water cooperation. These minimum requirements are captured by the four criteria for operationality that are incorporated into this indicator. 
Data Sources and Collection Method
Ministries and agencies responsible for surface water and groundwater resources (most commonly ministry of the environment, water, natural resources, energy or agriculture; foreign affairs, institutes of water resources, hydrology or geology, or geological surveys) typically maintain spatial information about the location and extent of the surface water basin boundaries and aquifer delineations as GIS shapefiles. Information on existing arrangement and their operationality is maintained by the same institutions. 
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Methodological approach: 
A reporting template related to SDG indicator 6.5.2 is communicated to the country by the custodian agencies. The template provides step-wise approach by which countries can calculate the value of the indicator. In order to substantiate the calculation and provide a fuller picture of transboundary water cooperation, countries are invited to complete the full reporting template, which contains a series of questions related to inter alia transboundary water cooperation at the national level, basin level agreements and arrangements, joint bodies, data and information exchange, joint monitoring and assessment, and public participation.  Countries are also encouraged to consult widely at the national level, and where appropriate other countries sharing transboundary basins, in order to complete the reporting template. 
Computation Method:
The calculation of the value of the indicator involves a number of steps: 
Step 1: The identification of transboundary river and lake basins and aquifers that are located within a country. If there are no transboundary river or lake basins, or aquifers, reporting is not required. 
Step 2: A calculation of the surface area (in km2) within the territory of the country of all identified transboundary river and lake basins. If there is more than one transboundary river and lake basin, the surface area with the territory of the country of each basin should be added together to get the total surface area of transboundary river and lake basins within the territory of the country.   Then, using the same approach the surface area (in km2) within the territory of the country of any transboundary aquifers should be calculated. The total surface area within the country of transboundary river and lake basins, and transboundary aquifers, should be added together to calculate the total transboundary basin surface area for the country. This can be done conveniently using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) techniques and available national or international databases. 
Step 3: Review existing arrangements for transboundary cooperation in water management and verify which transboundary basin areas (transboundary river and lake basins and/or transboundary aquifers or parts thereof) are covered by those arrangements.    
Step 4: Check which of the existing arrangements are operational, using the four criteria of operationality. 
Step 5: Calculate the percentage of transboundary basin area within a country with an operational arrangement for water cooperation (PTAOCA) using the formula: 
￼
where,
AOCA is the surface area of transboundary river and lake basins and aquifers in a country that are covered by an operational arrangement for water cooperation (results from Step 3 and 4); and
ATotal is the total area of transboundary river and lake basins and aquifers in a country (results from step 1 and 2). 
Comments and limitations:
The spatial information of transboundary river and lake basins and their catchment areas is readily available. However, information on the number and the areal extent of transboundary aquifers is often based on limited knowledge that may evolve over time and updating of the value may be required in each reporting cycle. 
The legal basis for cooperation develops slowly and takes several years, as opposed to some of the four criteria that assess the operationality of arrangements, which are more dynamic and can evolve over shorter time frames.   
The situation of each river, lake and aquifer is assessed for the calculation of the national indicator but the focus of the indicator is at the transboundary scale.  Harmonisation of data between countries sharing the same transboundary rivers, lakes and aquifers should therefore be covered.
Data Disaggregation
While it is important to calculate the indicator value for all transboundary waters within a country, the indicator value can be presented separately for river and lake basins, and aquifers. 
Indicator 6.a.1: Amount of water and sanitation-related official development assistance that is part of a government-coordinated spending plan
Target 6.a: By 2030, expand international cooperation and capacity-building support to developing countries in water- and sanitation-related activities and programmes, including water harvesting, desalination, water efficiency, wastewater treatment, recycling and reuse technologies
Goal 6: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the percentage of total water and sanitation-related Official Development Assistance (ODA) disbursements that are included in the government budget of developing countries. 
Concepts:
ODA is defined as those flows to countries and territories on the Development Assistance Committee’s (DAC) list of ODA recipients and to multilateral institutions which are
(1)    Provided by official agencies, including state and local governments, or by the executive agencies; and
(2)    Each transaction:
a. is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; and b. is concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25% (calculated at a rate of discount of 10%). 
Developing countries refers to those countries that are eligible to receive ODA according to the DAC’s list of ODA recipients. 
Water and sanitation-related activities and programmes include those for water supply, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) (targets 6.1,6.2), wastewater and water quality (6.3), water efficiency (6.4), water resource management (6.5), and water-related ecosystem (6.6). As per target 6.a, it also includes activities and programmes for water harvesting, desalination, water efficiency, wastewater treatment, recycling and reuse technologies. 
A government coordinated spending plan is defined as a financing plan/budget, for the water and sanitation sector, which clearly assesses the available sources of financing and strategies for financing future needs. 
Rationale and Interpretation: 
By measuring the percentage of water and sanitation ODA that is included in the government budget, it is possible to gain a better understanding of whether donors are aligned with national governments while highlighting total water and sanitation-related ODA disbursements over time. 
A low value of this indicator (near 0%) would suggest that international donors are investing in water and sanitation-related activities and programmes completely unaligned with the national government. On the contrary, a high value (near 100%) would indicate a stronger alignment of donors with the national government and policies for water and sanitation.
Data Sources and Collection Method
Data for the numerator for this indicator are collected from government report statistics on the amount of donor dunds that were included in the government budget. Some country provide this information to the UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking Water (GLAAS) survey. A draft survey response is compiled by an appointed focal point based on input from stakeholders, and is then finalized through a national multi-stakeholder review. Ministries with responsibilities related to finance, water supply and sanitation, agriculture, water resources development and management, environment, and foreign affairs would contribute to the survey response. 
The denominator is computed using OECD’s Creditor Reporting System (CRS) purpose codes 14000-series for the water sector and the purpose codes 31140 for agricultural water resources, 41050 for flood prevention and control, and 23220 for hydro-electric power plants. 
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
The percentage of total water and sanitation-related Official Development Assistance (ODA) disbursements that are included in the government budget of developing countries (PODA-WS) can be calculated using the following formula:
￼
where,
GOVODA-WS is the amount of water and sanitation-related ODA that are included in the government budget; and
TOTODA-WS is the total amount of water and sanitation-related ODA. 
Comments and limitations:
As the numerator and denominator come from different sources, there is a possibility of different underlying assumptions regarding what should be included/excluded in the ODA figures. This may lead to errors in the calculating of this indicator. To remedy this issue, countries would provide data for the numerator by matching project-level ODA figures from OECD with their on-budget project data. 
The OECD Creditor Reporting System (CRS) currently disaggregates ODA for the water and sanitation among several categories including: sector policy and administration, water resources protection, large and basic water and sanitation systems, river basin infrastructure, waste management, agricultural water resources, and education and training. While these categories do not align directly with the target areas of SDG 6 individually, which limits the disaggregation of ODA among the SDG target areas, the combined ODA from these categories does align with a majority of the reported ODA to the water sector. 
ODA represents only one aspect of international cooperation. To capture other dimensions, other indicators such as those from the Collaborative Behaviours identified by the Sanitation and Water for All (SWA) partnership, should also be reviewed. For further information on Collaborative Behaviours see: http://sanitationandwaterforall.org/about/the-four-swa-collaborative-behaviours/ 
Proxy, alternative and additional indicators:
Total amount of water and sanitation-related ODA
The absolute amount of water and sanitation-related ODA (denominator) is reported in constant USD. This will provide an indication of scale and to assess whether absolute levels of ODA are increasing or decreasing over time. 
Data Disaggregation
This indicator can be disaggregated by CRS code.
Indicator 6.b.1: Proportion of local administrative units with established and operational policies and procedures for participation of local communities in water and sanitation management  
Target 6.b: Support and strengthen the participation of local communities in improving water and sanitation management
Goal 6: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the percentage of local administrative units (as defined by the national government) that have established and operational policies and procedures by which individuals and communities can participate in decision making on water and sanitation management. 
Concepts:
Local administrative units refer to non-overlapping sub-districts, municipalities, communes, or other local community-level units covering both urban and rural areas as defined by the government. 
Policies and procedures for participation of local communities suggest presence of formal/legal mechanisms to ensure participation of users in planning water and sanitation activities. 
Formal or legal mechanisms are considered operational if they are implemented, with appropriate funding in place, and have means for verifying that participation took place. 
Water and sanitation-related activities and programmes include those for water supply, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) (targets 6.1,6.2), wastewater and water quality (6.3), water efficiency (6.4), water resource management (6.5), and water-related ecosystem (6.6). 
Rationale and Interpretation:
Participation of local communities is vital to ensure the needs of all the community are met, including the most vulnerable and also encourages ownership of schemes which in turn contributes to their sustainability. Defining the procedures in policy or law indicates a degree of formalization and consistency in the implementation of these procedures. 
A low value of this indicator would suggest that participation of local communities in water and sanitation management is low, whereas a high value would indicate high levels of participation, indicating greater ownership and a higher likelihood of sustainable delivery and management of water and sanitation services.
Data Sources and Collection Method
Potential data sources or monitoring mechanisms that could be used by national governments to collect this data include the following:
	•	Census of municipalities (assuming municipalities cover both urban and rural localities, and the government already conducts or is planning to conduct periodic censuses of municipalities); alternatively through a survey with representative sampling of municipalities.
	•	Including one or more questions in a community module of a national survey.
	•	Including this indicator in administrative data or WASH MIS to be collected at the local administrative unit level.
	•	Using focus groups and/or community dialogues on local participation with key informants, members of the general public (See: UNDP. A user’s guide to measuring local governance. Available at http://www.undp.org/content/dam/aplaws/publication/en/publications/democratic-governance/dg-publications-for-website/a-users-guide-to-measuring-local-governance-/LG%20Guide.pdf), and NGOs active in the community.
	•	Collecting information through existing projects at local administrative unit level.
	•	Innovative data collection methods such as crowdsourcing or SMS surveys. 
For some countries, data for the numerator and denominator for this indicator are also collected through the UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking Water (GLAAS) survey, which collect statistics on of donor funds that were included in the government budget. 
A draft survey response is compiled by an appointed focal point based on input from stakeholders, and is then finalized through a national multi-stakeholder review. Ministries with responsibilities related to finance, water supply and sanitation, agriculture, water resources development and management, environment, and foreign affairs would contribute to the survey response. 
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
The percentage of local administrative units with established and operational policies and procedures for participation of local communities in water and sanitation management (PLAP) is calculated as follows: 
￼
Comments and limitations:
As the indicator is computed as a percentage of local administrative units, it does not reflect the percentage of the population covered by policies and procedures for community participation. 
As local administrative units are defined country-by-country, the population covered by each unit may vary widely within and between countries. There may be large discrepancies within a country on the population per local administrative unit between urban and rural areas. Consequently, the comparability of this indicator between countries is limited. 
There is a degree of subjectivity in what constitutes an “established and operational” policy or procedure, as well as on the definition of “participation”. Further study is currently ongoing to better define these concepts regarding community participation. 
Policies and procedures are often established at the central level, but operationalization is not always monitored centrally. In addition, established and operational policies and procedures do not necessarily lead to high levels of participation. 
The indicator does not necessarily correlate with quality of water and sanitation management: High community participation does not always lead to better water and sanitation management, and low participation does not indicate that water and sanitation management is poor. 
The indicator does not capture informal participation procedures, which may be just as effective as those that are formally defined. 
Proxy, alternative and additional indicators:
The past several cycles of the UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking Water (GLAAS) survey have included a question on the presence of clearly defined procedures in laws or policies at the national level for local participation in planning programmes, as well as on the extent of participation (low/moderate/high). Responses are disaggregated for urban and rural sanitation, urban and rural drinking water supply, hygiene promotion, and water resources management. The following data are available:
	•	presence or absence in a country of clearly defined procedures in law or policy for participation by service users/communities in planning program in water, sanitation and hygiene management
	•	presence or absence in a country of a high level of users/communities participating in planning programs in water, sanitation and hygiene management
The OECD Water Governance Indicator Framework, launched in March 2018, includes indicators on stakeholder engagement to appraise the existence and level of implementation  of legal frameworks to engage stakeholders in water-related decision making ( Principle 10). The indicator can inform on community participation.
Data Disaggregation
This indicator is not required to be disaggregated but it can be disaggregated by subsector (urban/rural drinking-water and sanitation, water resources management).
SDG 6: Water and Sanitation

Clean, accessible water for all is an essential part of the world we want to live in and there is sufficient fresh water on the planet to achieve this. However, due to bad economics or poor infrastructure, millions of people including children die every year from diseases associated with inadequate water supply, sanitation and hygiene.

Water scarcity, poor water quality and inadequate sanitation negatively impact food security, livelihood choices and educational opportunities for poor families across the world. At the current time, more than 2 billion people are living with the risk of reduced access to freshwater resources and by 2050, at least one in four people is likely to live in a country affected by chronic or recurring shortages of fresh water. Drought in specific afflicts some of the worlds poorest countries, worsening hunger and malnutrition. Fortunately, there has been great progress made in the past decade regarding drinking sources and sanitation, whereby over 90% of the worlds population now has access to improved sources of drinking water.

To improve sanitation and access to drinking water, there needs to be increased investment in management of freshwater ecosystems and sanitation facilities on a local level in several developing countries within Sub Saharan Africa, Central Asia, Southern Asia, Eastern Asia and South Eastern Asia.




3 in 10 people lack access to safely managed drinking water services and 6 in 10 people lack access to safely managed sanitation facilities.
At least 892 million people continue to practice open defecation.
Women and girls are responsible for water collection in 80 per cent of households without access to water on premises.
Between 1990 and 2015, the proportion of the global population using an improved drinking water source has increased from 76 per cent to 90 per cent
Water scarcity affects more than 40 per cent of the global population and is projected to rise. Over 1.7 billion people are currently living in river basins where water use exceeds recharge.
4 billion people lack access to basic sanitation services, such as toilets or latrines
More than 80 per cent of wastewater resulting from human activities is discharged into rivers or sea without any pollution removal
Each day, nearly 1,000 children die due to preventable water and sanitation related diarrheal diseases
Approximately 70 per cent of all water abstracted from rivers, lakes and aquifers is used for irrigation

CLEAN WATER AND SANITATION: WHY IT MATTERS
To ensure access to safe water sources and sanitation for all.
Access to water, sanitation and hygiene is a human right, yet billions are still faced with daily challenges accessing even the most basic of services.
Around 1.8 billion people globally use a source of drinking water that is fecally contaminated. Some 2.4 billion people lack access to basic sanitation services, such as toilets or latrines. Water scarcity affects more than 40 per cent of the global population and is projected to rise. More than 80 per cent of wastewater resulting from human activities is discharged into rivers or sea without any treatment, leading to pollution.

Water and sanitation related diseases remain among the major causes of death in children under five; more than 800 children die every day from diarrhoeal diseases linked to poor hygiene.
Proper water and sanitation is a key foundation for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, including good health and gender equality.
By managing our water sustainably, we are also able to better manage our production of food and energy and contribute to decent work and economic growth. Moreover, we can preserve our water ecosystems, their biodiversity, and take action on climate change.
A study by the World Bank Group, UNICEF and the World Health Organization estimates that extending basic water and sanitation services to the unserved would cost US$28.4 billion per year from 2015 to 2030, or 0.10 per cent of the global product of the 140 countries included in its study.
The costs are huge both for people and for the economy.
Worldwide, more than 2 million people die every year from diarrhoeal diseases. Poor hygiene and unsafe water are responsible for nearly 90 per cent of these deaths and mostly affect children.
The economic impact of not investing in water and sanitation costs 4.3 per cent of sub Saharan African GDP. The World Bank estimates that 6.4 per cent of Indias GDP is lost due to adverse economic impacts and costs of inadequate sanitation.
Without better infrastructure and management, millions of people will continue to die every year and there will be further losses in biodiversity and ecosystem resilience, undermining prosperity and efforts towards a more sustainable future.
Civil society organizations should work to keep governments accountable, invest in water research and development, and promote the inclusion of women, youth and indigenous communities in water resources governance.
Generating awareness of these roles and turning them into action will lead to win win results and increased sustainability and integrity for both human and ecological systems.
You can also get involved in the World Water Day and World Toilet Day campaigns that aim to provide information and inspiration to take action on hygiene issues.

Goal 6. Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all 
Water and sanitation are at the very core of sustainable development, critical to the survival of people and the planet. Goal 6 not only addresses the issues relating to drinking water, sanitation and hygiene, but also the quality and sustainability of water resources worldwide. In 2015, 4.9 billion people globally used an improved sanitation facility;  2.4 billion did not. Among those lacking adequate sanitation were 946 million people without any facilities at all, who continued to practise open defecation. In 2015, 68 per cent of the global population was using improved sanitation facilities compared to 59 per cent in 2000. Nevertheless, the unsafe management of faecal waste and wastewater continues to present a major risk to public health and the environment. More progress has been made in access to drinking water. In 2015, 6.6 billion people, or 91 per cent of the global population, used an improved drinking water source, versus 82 per cent in 2000. Despite that improvement, an estimated  663 million people were using unimproved water sources or surface water that year. While coverage was around 90 per cent or more in all regions except sub Saharan Africa and Oceania, widespread inequalities persist within and among countries. Moreover, not all improved sources are safe. For instance, in 2012 it was estimated that at least 1.8 billion people were exposed to drinking water sources contaminated with faecal matter.Holistic management of the water cycle means taking into account the level of water stress, calculated as the ratio of total fresh water withdrawn by all major sectors to the total renewable fresh water resources in a particular country or region. Currently, water stress affects more than 2 billion people around the world, a figure that is projected to rise. Already, water stress affects countries on every continent and hinders the sustainability of natural resources, as well as economic and social development. In 2011, 41 countries experienced water stress, an increase from  36 countries in 1998. Of those, 10 countries, on the Arabian Peninsula, in Central Asia and in Northern Africa, withdrew more than 100 per cent of their renewable fresh water resources. Integrated water resources management, one of the follow up actions to the Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development (Johannesburg Plan of Implementation), aims to address this urgent situation. In 2012, 65 per cent of the 130 countries that responded to a survey question on integrated water resources management reported that management plans were in place at the national level. Total official flows for water and sanitation were $10 billion in 2014, of which total aid flows from DAC donors amounted to $8 billion. Aid for water and sanitation nearly doubled as a share of ODA during the International Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade (1981 1990). Since that time, on average, it has remained at around 7 per cent of total aid flows. Better targeting and tracking of water aid within the context of national situations is needed. For instance, numerous countries with limited access to water supply and/or sanitation have been receiving minimal external assistance (typically less than $2 per capita annually), while other countries with higher levels of access have received much more (at least $30 per capita a year).Effective water and sanitation management also depends on the participation of stakeholders. According to a 2013 2014 Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking Water survey, 83 per cent of the 94 countries surveyed reported that procedures for stakeholder participation were clearly defined in law or policy. In the Sustainable Development Goals, the focus is being refined to also include the participation of local communities, which will be captured in the next cycle of Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking Water monitoring.
Goal 6. Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all
Access to safe water and sanitation and sound management of freshwater ecosystems are essential to human health and to environmental sustainability and economic prosperity.
		In 2015, 6.6 billion people (over 90 per cent of the worlds population) used improved drinking water sources and 4.9 billion people (over two thirds of the worlds population) used improved sanitation facilities. In both cases, people without access live predominantly in rural areas. Achieving universal access to basic sanitation and ending the unsafe practice of open defecation will require substantial acceleration of progress in rural areas of Central and Southern Asia, Eastern and South Eastern Asia and sub Saharan Africa. 
		Effective water and sanitation management relies on the participation of a range of stakeholders, including local communities. A 2016 2017 survey found that over 80 per cent of 74 responding countries had clearly defined procedures for engaging service users/communities in water and sanitation management. 
		More than 2 billion people globally are living in countries with excess water stress, defined as the ratio of total freshwater withdrawn to total renewable freshwater resources above a threshold of 25 per cent. Northern Africa and Western Asia experience water stress levels above 60 per cent, which indicates the strong probability of future water scarcity. 
		In 2012, 65 per cent of the 130 countries that responded to a survey on integrated water resources management reported that management plans were in place at the national level. 
		ODA for the water sector has been rising steadily, but has remained relatively constant as a proportion of total ODA disbursements, at approximately 5 per cent since 2005. In 2015, ODA disbursements in the water sector totalled about $8.6 billion, which represents an increase of 67 per cent in real terms since 2005. 


Goal 6. Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all
Too many people still lack access to safely managed water and sanitation facilities. Water scarcity, flooding and lack of proper management of wastewater hinder social and economic development. Increasing water efficiency and improving water management are critical to balancing the competing and growing water demands from various sectors and users.In 2015, 5.2 billion people used safely managed drinking water services  an improved water source located on the premises, available when needed and free from contamination  which represents 71 per cent of the global population. An additional 1.3 billion people (17 per cent of the global population) used a basic drinking water source  an improved water source not more than 30 minutes away. This means that 844 million people around the world still lack even a basic level of service.According to estimates from 84 countries, in 2015, 39 per cent of the global population used safely managed sanitation services  basic facilities that safely dispose of human waste. An additional 29 per cent of the global population used a basic sanitation service  an improved facility that is not shared. In 2015, 2.3 billion people still lacked even a basic level of service and 892 million people continued to practise open defecation, resulting in a decline from 20 per cent in 2000 to 12 per cent in 2015. In 2015, only 27 per cent of the population in the least developed countries had basic handwashing facilities.Untreated wastewater degrades water quality, posing risks to public health, contaminates drinking water sources and limits opportunities for safe and productive reuse of water. Preliminary estimates from household data of 79 mostly high and high middle income countries (excluding much of Africa and Asia) show that 59 per cent of all wastewater flows are safely treated, 76 per cent of flows are safely treated in households with a sewer connection and 18 per cent of flows are safely collected and treated for those with on site facilities only.In 22 countries (mostly in Northern Africa, Western Asia and Central and Southern Asia), water stress  defined as the ratio of fresh water withdrawn to total renewable freshwater resources  is above 70 per cent, which indicates a strong probability of future water scarcity. In 15 of these countries, withdrawals totalled more than 100 per cent of the renewable freshwater resources in the country.In the period 20172018, 157 countries reported an average implementation of integrated water resources management of 48 per cent.According to data from 62 out of 153 countries sharing transboundary waters, the average percentage of national transboundary basins covered by an operational arrangement was 59 per cent in the period 20172018, and only 17 countries reported that all their transboundary basins were covered by such arrangements.ODA for the water sector was $9 billion in 2016. While disbursements from 2011 to 2016 increased, as commitments fell, disbursements may also decrease in the future. Any reduction in external aid is likely to hamper progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 6, as a 2017 survey found that over 80 per cent of countries reported insufficient finances to attain national WASH targets.
