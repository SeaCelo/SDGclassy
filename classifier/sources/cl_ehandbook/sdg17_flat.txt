Indicator 17.1.1: Total government revenue as a proportion of GDP, by source
Target 17.1: Strengthen domestic resource mobilization, including through international support to developing countries, to improve domestic capacity for tax and other revenue collection
Goal 17: Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the share of total central  government revenue expressed as a proportion of the GDP. 
Concepts:
Revenue is defined in Chapter 4 (paragraph 4.23) of Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM) 2014 as an increase in net worth resulting from a transaction. It is a fiscal indicator for assessing the sustainability of fiscal activities. General government units have four types of revenue. The major types of revenue are taxes (GFS code 11), social contributions (GFS code 12), grants (GFS code 13), and other revenue (GFS code 14). Of these, compulsory levies and transfers are the main sources of revenue for most general government units. In particular, taxes are compulsory, unrequited amounts receivable by government units from institutional units. Social contributions are actual or imputed revenue receivable by social insurance schemes to make provision for social insurance benefits payable. Grants are transfers receivable by government units from other resident or nonresident government units or international organizations, and that do not meet the definition of a tax, subsidy, or social contribution. Other revenue is all revenue receivable excluding taxes, social contributions, and grants. Other revenue comprises: (i) property income; (ii) sales of goods and services; (iii) fines, penalties, and forfeits; (iv) transfers not elsewhere classified; and (v) premiums, fees, and claims related to nonlife insurance and standardized guarantee schemes. 
The transactions and the associated classifications are detailed in Chapter 5 of GFSM 2014 and are structured to demonstrate how general government (and public sector) units raise revenue. Only those taxes and social insurance contributions that are evidenced by tax assessments and declarations, customs declarations, and similar documents are considered to create revenue for government units. The analytic framework of GFSM 2014 (like that of the GFSM 2001) builds on the GFSM 1986 framework, and extends it by incorporating additional elements that are useful in assessing fiscal policy. 
An important example is the treatment of nonfinancial assets, where the sale of such assets is no longer included in revenue. The disposal of a nonfinancial asset by sale or barter is not revenue because it has no effect on net worth. Rather, it changes the composition of the balance sheet by exchanging one asset (the nonfinancial asset) for another (the proceeds of the sale). Similarly, amounts receivable from loan repayments and loan disbursements are not revenue. In general, transactions that increase net worth result from current operations. Capital transfers are an exception. In GFSM 2014, capital transfers receivable are classified as revenue because they increase the recipient’s net worth and they are often indistinguishable from current transfers in their effect on government operations. 
In recording cash-based accounting revenue transactions, data representing the tax payments received by government, net of refunds paid out during the period covered should be reported. These data will include taxes paid after the original assessment, taxes paid or refunds deducted from taxes after subsequent assessments, and taxes paid or refunds deducted after any subsequent reopening of the accounts. Therefore, total tax revenue could be presented on a gross basis as the total amount of all taxes accrued, or on a net basis as the gross amount minus tax refunds. Revenue categories are presented gross of expense categories for the same or related category. In particular, interest revenue is presented gross rather than as net interest expense or net interest revenue. Similarly, social benefits and social contributions, grant revenue and expense, and rent revenue and expense are presented gross. Also, sales of goods and services are presented gross of the expenses incurred in their production. In cases of erroneous or unauthorized transactions, revenue categories are presented net of refunds of the relevant revenue, and expense categories are presented net of inflows from the recovery of the expense. For example, refunds of income taxes may be paid when the amount of taxes withheld or otherwise paid in advance of the final determination exceeds the actual tax due. Such refunds are recorded as a reduction in tax revenue. For this reason, tax revenue is presented net of non-payable tax credits (see GFSM 2014 paragraphs 5.29–5.32). 
Rationale and Interpretation:
Fiscal policy is the use of the level and composition of the general government and public sectors’ spending and revenue—and the related accumulation of government assets and liabilities—to achieve such goals as the stabilization of the economy, the reallocation of resources, and the redistribution of income. In addition to revenue mobilization, government units may also finance a portion of their activities in a specific period by borrowing or by acquiring funds from sources other than compulsory transfers—for example, interest revenue, incidental sales of goods and services, or the rent of subsoil assets. Indicator 17.1.1 supports understanding countries’ domestic revenue mobilization in the form of tax and nontax sources. The indicator will provide analysts with a cross-country comparable dataset that highlights the relationship between the four main types of revenue as well as the relative "tax burden" (revenue in the form of taxes) and “fiscal burden” (revenue in the form of taxes plus social contributions).
Data Sources and Collection Method
Annual GFS series are normally compiled from accounting records, budget execution reports, and financial statements. In some instances, compilers may need surveys and other means of obtaining data where suitable accounting records, financial statements or budget execution reports are not available, for example, for data on local governments. Approaches using these sources are further outlined in Chapter 7 and 8 of the “Government Finance Statistics: Compilation Guide for Developing Countries”, available at https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/gfs/manual/gfs.htm. Staff of the IMF Statistics Department, Government Finance Division may be contacted for additional guidance.
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
 
The indicator is expressed as annual GFS revenue as a percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). 
“Classification of the GFSM 1986 Data to the GFSM 2014 Framework”, available at https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/gfs/manual/comp.htm, can be referenced with the aim of obtaining the key GFSM 2014 Revenue categories:
 ￼
Section B of the document (pages 7-13) provides a detailed mapping. Experience gained through many years of GFS Training and Technical Assistance aimed at building the capacity of national authorities has demonstrated that all components related to GFSM 1986 total revenue and grants may be classified to the GFSM 2014 aggregate revenue, except for the sales of fixed capital assets, (strategic) stocks, and land and intangible assets, which are classified to the net investment in nonfinancial assets (disposals/sales).   
Indicator 17.1.1 can be derived using series that are basic to the GFS reporting framework. Each revenue transaction is classified according to whether it is a tax or another type of revenue. GFS revenue aggregates are summations of individual entries and elements in this particular class of flows and allow for these data to be arranged in a manageable and analytically useful way. For example, tax revenue is the sum of all flows that are classified as taxes. Conceptually, the value for each main revenue aggregate is the sum of the values for all items in the relevant category. 
Comments and limitations:
In principle, GFS should cover all entities that materially affect fiscal policies. Cross-country comparisons are ideally made with reference to the consolidated general government sector. However, for most developing and many emerging market economies, compiling data for the consolidated general government and its subsectors is problematic owing to limitations in the availability and/or timeliness of source data. For example, a country may have one central government; several state, provincial, or regional governments; and many local governments. Countries may also have social security funds. The GFSM 2014 recommends that statistics should be compiled for all such general government units. 
Some countries report data for the consolidated general government with one or more sub-sectors not separately reported. Similarly, there are some countries that report “consolidated central government” without necessarily providing the budgetary central government subsector separately. For many emerging market and low-income countries with limited statistical capacity, budgetary central government is considered the most appropriate level of institutional coverage for comparison purposes. Budgetary central government, as described in GFSM 2014 (paragraph 2.81), is an institutional unit of the general government sector particularly important in terms of size and power, particularly the power to exercise control over many other units and entities. This component of general government is usually covered by the main (or general) budget. The budgetary central government’s revenue (and expense) are normally regulated and controlled by a ministry of finance, or its functional equivalent, by means of a budget approved by the legislature.

Data Disaggregation
The four types of revenue: Taxes, Social contributions, Grants and Other revenue can be further disaggregated, as outlined in Chapter 5, GFSM 2014.
Indicator 17.1.2: Proportion of domestic budget funded by domestic taxes
Target 17.1: Strengthen domestic resource mobilization, including through international support to developing countries, to improve domestic capacity for tax and other revenue collection
Goal 17: Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the percentage of domestic budgetary central government expenditure that is funded by tax revenue. 
Concepts:
Budgetary central government refers to the central government that encompasses the fundamental activities of the national executive, legislative, and judiciary powers. 
Expenditure is the sum of two key aggregates: expense and the net investment in non-financial assets; it is presented as an additional aggregate in the GFS Statement of Operations. 
Revenue is an increase in net worth resulting from a transaction. The major types of revenue for the budgetary central government are taxes, social contributions, grants, and other revenue. 
The key concepts and terms associated with the indicator are outlined in Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM) 2014. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
The indicator highlights the relationship between the executed national budget and the country’s capacity to mobilize needed resources through its revenue/tax administration. By focusing on the contribution of taxation as opposed to all sources of government revenue, the indicator can represent domestic non-earmarked resource mobilization that is under direct control of the national authorities. 
As such, this indicator supports an understanding of the extent to which countries’ recurrent and capital outlays (expenditures) are actually covered by domestic resource mobilization in the form of taxation.  It is also a direct measure of the countries’ tax collection capacity. 
Data Sources and Collection Method
GFS are compiled and maintained by central government agencies such as the Ministry of Finance, Central Bank or National Statistical Offices. 
Government revenue and expenditure data is also reported to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) by member countries are compiled (and disseminated) in a global GFS database. Historical series have been aligned with the GFSM 2014 classifications.
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
The percentage of domestic budgetary central government expenditure that is funded by tax revenue (Ptax) is calculated as:
￼
Comments and limitations:
In principle, Government Financial Statistics (GFS) should cover all entities (general government units) that materially affect fiscal policies. However, for most developing and many emerging market economies, compiling data for the consolidated general government and its subsectors is problematic owing to limitations in the availability and/or timeliness of source data. A country may have one central government; several state, provincial, or regional governments; and many local or municipal governments, and the GFSM 2014 recommends that statistics should be compiled for all such general government units. Where possible, and particularly among advanced and key emerging market economies, comparisons should be made using consolidated general government series.

Data Disaggregation
Data can be disaggregated according to the components and aggregates of the GFS classification structure, for instance by types of revenue and types of government expenditure. 
Indicator 17.15.1: Extent of use of country-owned results frameworks and planning tools by providers of development cooperation 
Target 17.15: Respect each country's policy space and leadership to establish and implement policies for poverty eradication and sustainable development
Goal 17: Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator measures the extent to which, and the ways in which, all concerned development partners use country-led results frameworks (CRFs) to plan development cooperation efforts and assess their performance. 
Concepts:
CRFs define a country’s approach to results and its associated monitoring and evaluation systems focusing on performance and achievement of development results. Using a minimal definition, these results frameworks include agreed objectives and results indicators. They also set targets to measure progress in achieving the objectives defined in the government’s planning documents. Some examples of CRF are long term vision plans; national development strategies; joint government-multi-donor plans; government’s sector strategies, policies and plans; subnational planning instruments, as well as other frameworks (e.g. budget support performance matrices, sector-wide approaches). In contrast, planning and priority setting documents produced outside the government, such as country strategies prepared by providers, are not considered CRFs. The definition of country-led results framework used here allows the possibility to use equivalent priority-setting mechanisms at the country level since not all countries articulate their priorities through consistent, integrated CRFs. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
Measuring the alignment of development partners’ support to country priorities in terms of intervention design and type of results-reporting mechanisms provides a relevant assessment regarding the degree of “respect for each country’s policy space and leadership to establish and implement country-owned policies for poverty eradication and sustainable development”.
Data Sources and Collection Method
At country level, data are reported by relevant government entities (e.g. the Ministry of finance/budget department for national budget information) and by development partners and stakeholders. More details on the data collection process can be found in the related monitoring guidance at http://effectivecooperation.org/pdf/2018_Monitoring_Guide_National_Coordinator.pdf. 
OECD and UNDP are supporting countries in collecting relevant data on a biennial basis through the Global Partnership monitoring framework, and these organisations lead data aggregation and quality assurance at the global level. Data and evidence generated through the country-led monitoring process are disseminated through the online Global Partnership Monitoring Dashboard.
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
To provide a comprehensive measure on the use of country‐owned results frameworks and other government‐led planning tools, the indicator calculates the degree to which objectives, results indicators and monitoring frameworks associated with new development interventions (US$ 100,000 and above) are drawn from government sources –including national, sector and subnational planning tools.
The following table shows the three dimensions on which this is assessed, and their unit of assessment:
For each development intervention of significant size
(US$ 1 million and above) approved during the year of reference
Q1
Whether objectives are drawn from government-led results frameworks, plans and strategies
0/1
Q2
Share of results (outcome) indicators that are drawn from government-led results frameworks, plans and strategies
%
Q3
Share of results (outcome) indicators that will rely on sources of data provided by existing country-led monitoring systems or national statistical services to track project progress
%
Step 1:
Below are the formulae for the computation of the values for each of the three dimensions:
￼
Q1is abinary indicator which takes the value of 0 or 1 based on the above criteria. 
Q2 and Q3 are calculated as below:
￼
where nr is the number of outcome indicators drawn from existing government results frameworks and/or other planning documents; ns is the number of outcome indicators to be tracked using government ongoing statistics, data sources or M&E systems (i.e. not project‐specific sources); n is the total number of outcome indicators included in the project’s results framework. 
Step 2:
For this step, Q1j, Q2j, Q3j denotes the values for Q1­, Q2, and Q3 for project j, respectively.
For the year of reference:
(1)    Aggregated averages per developing country provide an assessment of the country’s available policy space and leadership (Ic). For a country c, the indicator I takes the value:
￼ 
where, nc is the number of new development cooperation projects reported for country c.  In the formula above, the indicator is obtained by taking the average of the three dimensions of alignment with country’s priorities and goals and then aggregating across all new development cooperation projects within the country.
(2)     Aggregated averages per provider of development cooperation will indicate the percentage of alignment with country-led priority setting mechanisms (Ip). For a provider p, the indicator (I) takes the value:
￼ 
where, np is the number of new development cooperation projects reported for provider p.  Similar to the previous formula, the indicator is obtained by taking the average of the three dimensions of alignment with country’s priorities and goals and then aggregating across all new development cooperation projects for the provider. 
Step 3:
A global aggregate for the indicator is obtained by averaging the three dimensions of alignment with country’s priorities and goals across all new interventions for the reporting year: 
￼
Comments and limitations:
When aggregating, the size of the development cooperation project/intervention is not considered as a weight in order to give the same level of importance to the extent of use of country‐owned results frameworks and planning tools in medium‐sized vs. larger projects. This is because this indicator tries to capture the overall behaviour of providers in designing new interventions in a given country. Weighting by project size would otherwise over‐represent infrastructure projects and underrepresent interventions focused on influencing policies and institutional arrangements. Nevertheless, data on project size is available. 
Current monitoring exercises are collecting data beyond the scope of the proposed indicator, including aspects such as provider government engagement in project planning and programme evaluations. This may be refined further.

Data Disaggregation
This indicator can be disaggregated at the country, provider, sector and the development project level.
Indicator 17.16.1: Number of countries reporting progress in multi-stakeholder development effectiveness monitoring frameworks that support the achievement of the sustainable development goals 
Target 17.16: Enhance the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development, complemented by multi-stakeholder partnerships that mobilize and share knowledge, expertise, technology and financial resources, to support the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals in all countries, in particular developing countries
Goal 17: Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator tracks the number of countries reporting progress in multi-stakeholder monitoring frameworks that track the implementation of development effectiveness commitments supporting the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 
Concepts:
“Multi-stakeholder development effectiveness monitoring frameworks” that track effective development cooperation are monitoring frameworks:
-          whose indicators have been agreed on a voluntary basis; whose indicators measure the strength of the relationship between development actors;
-          where data collection and review is led by the countries themselves; and where participation in data collection and review involves relevant multi-stakeholder representing, at minimum, the public sector, the private sector and civil society organizations. 
The Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation (Global Partnership) is an example of development effectiveness monitoring frameworks. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals requires mobilizing and strengthening multi-stakeholder partnerships that can bring and effectively use all the available knowledge, expertise, technology and financial resources for sustainable development. The quality of the relationship between all the relevant partners defines the strength of the global partnership for sustainable development.
This indicator provides a measure of countries’ efforts to enhance such multi-stakeholder partnerships, and by extension the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development, by looking at progress made on a set of indicators that track how well country providers and recipients of development co-operation are working together towards sustainable development.
Reflecting the spirit of the global partnership for sustainable development, and the universal nature of the SDGs, the indicator monitors the contribution and behaviour of both provider and recipient countries in establishing more effective, inclusive multi-stakeholder partnerships to support and sustain the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. It does so by measuring their respective but differentiated commitments to strengthen the quality of their development partnerships.
Data Sources and Collection Method
Country governments receiving development co-operation lead and coordinate data collection and validation. At country level, data are reported by relevant government entities (e.g. the Ministry of finance/budget department for national budget information) and by development partners and stakeholders. OECD and UNDP are supporting countries in collecting relevant data on a biennial basis through the Global Partnership monitoring framework, and these organisations lead data aggregation and quality assurance at the global level. More details on the data collection process can be found in the Monitoring Guide at http://effectivecooperation.org/pdf/2018_Monitoring_Guide_National_Coordinator.pdf 
Complementarily, the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs has been conducting regular surveys for the Development Cooperation Forum in partnership with UNDP to identify national progress in mutual accountability and transparency. Synergies with the measurement of indicator 7 of the Global Partnership monitoring framework are being used.
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
To reflect the universal nature of target 17.16, this indicator is presented as the global aggregate number of countries reporting progress. For any country reporting towards one (or more) multi-stakeholder development effectiveness framework(s), the country  is considered to be reporting progress when, for the year of reference, the number of indicators within the framework(s) that show a positive trend is greater than the number of indicators that show a negative trend.
Countries providing development co-operation funding and reporting in multi-stakeholder development effectiveness monitoring frameworks are assessed against the following elements:
	1.	Aligning to country-defined development objectives: Percentage of new development interventions whose objectives are drawn from country-led results frameworks.
	2.	Using country-led results frameworks: Percentage of results indicators contained in new development interventions, which are drawn from country-led results frameworks.
	3.	Using national monitoring and statistical systems: Percentage of results indicators which will be monitored using government sources and monitoring systems.
	4.	Using national evaluation systems: Percentage of new interventions that plan a final evaluation with country government involvement.
	5.	Transparency of development co-operation: Public availability of information on development co‑operation according to international reporting standards;
	6.	Annual predictability of development co-operation: Proportion of development co-operation disbursed as development partners had scheduled at the beginning of the year.
	7.	Medium-term predictability of development co-operation: forward-looking spending plans made available to the partner government (indicative annual amounts of development co-operation support to be provided over the one-to-three years)
	8.	Development co-operation on budgets subject to parliamentary oversight: share of development co-operation funds planned to/for the country's public sector that are recorded in the annual budget submitted for legislative approval.
	9.	Development co-operation delivered through country systems: Proportion of development cooperation disbursed to a given country according to national regulations and systems for public financial management (i.e. budgeting, financial reporting, auditing) and procurement.
	10.	Untied Aid: Proportion of development co-operation that is untied. 
Countries receiving development co-operation funding and reporting in multi-stakeholder development effectiveness monitoring frameworks are assessed against the following elements: 
	1.	Leading in setting up national priorities: Countries strengthen their national results frameworks.
	2.	Creating an enabling environment for civil society organisations: Civil society organizations operate within an environment that maximises their engagement in and contribution to development.
	3.	Promoting private sector engagement and contribution to development: Quality of public-private dialogue.
	4.	Recording development co-operation on budgets subject to parliamentary oversight: share of development co-operation funds planned to/for the country’s public sector that are recorded in the annual budget submitted for legislative approval.
	5.	Strengthening mutual accountability: Mutual accountability among development actors is strengthened through inclusive reviews Strengthening gender equality and women’s empowerment: Countries have systems to track and make public allocations for gender equality and women’s empowerment.
	6.	Strengthening domestic institutions: Quality of the country’s Public Financial Management Systems 
Countries providing and receiving development co-operation funding and reporting in multi-stakeholder development effectiveness monitoring frameworks.
For countries reporting both as providers and recipients of development co-operation, progress is calculated separately based on the respective set of indicators described above. Disaggregated results will show the detailed performance in each category. For the ultimate count of the number of countries making progress, dual countries are accounted as making progress if progress is made as recipient or as provider of development co-operation.  
Comments and limitations:
Data collection for the Global Partnership monitoring framework is led by low and middle-income countries receiving development co-operation. Progress of countries providing development co-operation in implementing development effectiveness commitments is captured through their partnership behaviour in those low and middle-income countries. Depending on each case, middle-income countries that currently are both recipient and providers of development cooperation opt to report in their role as recipient and/or provider of development cooperation. 
Data Disaggregation
The indicator presented as a global aggregate is generated through a bottom-up approach whereby data is collected at the country level and can therefore be disaggregated back at the level of countries (for both development cooperation providers and recipients) for national analysis and mutual dialogue. The data can also be further disaggregated according to individual indicators (i.e. specific dimensions of effective development cooperation) that are included within the multi- stakeholder frameworks.
Indicator 17.18.3: Number of countries with a national statistical plan that is fully funded and under implementation, by source of funding 
Target 17.18: By 2020, enhance capacity-building support to developing countries, including for least developed countries and small island developing States, to increase significantly the availability of high quality, timely and reliable data disaggregated by income, gender, age, race, ethnicity, migratory status, disability, geographic location and other characteristics relevant in national contexts
Goal 17: Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
The indicator is defined as the number of countries with a national statistical plan that is fully funded and under implementation, as reported in the annual status reports on National Strategies for the Development of Statistics.  
Concepts:
Fully funded means …the total amount of the National Statistics Plan’s budget has been secured (committed or disbursed) and there is no funding gap remaining. 
National statistical plan is defined as an NSDS or similar national policy document that covers the development and ownership of statistics in a country. 
A National Strategy for the Development of Statistics (NSDS) is a national framework, process and product for statistics development aimed at mainstreaming statistics into national policy and planning process; producing information responding to the needs of the various users; mainstreaming sectors and other players into the National Statistics System (NSS); coordinating the entire NSS; responding to data challenges; delivering a country-led data revolution; and building statistical capacity across the “the statistical value chain”. The NSDS spans a five to ten year implementation period. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
This indicator is a direct measurement of the number of countries that are working towards enhancing their statistical capacity so that high quality, timely and reliable data is available to track progress on the SDGs. 
Data Sources and Collection Method
Data for this indicator can come from national focal points based in country’s national statistical offices (NSO). Information is collected annually. 
PARIS21 collects this data as well, liaising directly with the national focal points.
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
This indicator is calculated as a global aggregate through a simple addition of countries that are (1) implementing a strategy, (2) designing a strategy, or (3) awaiting adoption of a strategy in the current year.  The level of funding of the plan is measured by aggregating the funding committed by the different funders. If the total committed equals the total fund required for the plan, then it is fully funded, otherwise it is partially funded.

Indicator 17.19.1: Dollar value of all resources made available to strengthen statistical capacity in developing countries
Target 17.19: By 2030, build on existing initiatives to develop measurements of progress on sustainable development that complement gross domestic product, and support statistical capacity-building in developing countries
Goal 17: Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the total US dollar value of all resources that are made available to strengthen statistical capacity in developing countries. It is based on the Partner Report on Support to Statistics (PRESS) which are designed and administered by PARIS21. 
Concepts: 
Resources are defined as all funding allocated to project/programs defined by the Creditor Reporting System (CRS) as statistical capacity building as well as technical assistance, training, goods and equipment, facilities etc. within such projects. ([1] CRS Purpose Code 16062: Statistical capacity building: Both in national statistical offices and any other government ministries. ) 
Statistical capacity building is the process through which a country’s national statistical system, its organisations and individuals obtain, strengthen and maintain their abilities to collect, produce, analyse and disseminate high quality and reliable data to meet users’ needs.
PRESS is one of PARIS21's flagship publications. It presents data on technical and financial support to statistical development worldwide and is thus a valuable tool for collaboration. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
This indicator is a direct measure of the global effort to support statistical capacity-building in developing countries.
Data Sources and Collection Method
This indicator relies upon three sources of data:
(1)    OECD’s CRS, which records ODA and Other Official Flows (OOF) data from the Development Assistance Committee’s (DAC) members and some non-members, and provides comprehensive accounting of ODA. Any ODA and OOF reported by donors for Statistical Capacity Building (SCB) is designated by code 16062;
(2)    In cases where SCB is a part of a larger project and is not directly captured by the CRS under code 16062, PARIS21searches project descriptions for an SCB component, and adds it to the total disbursements for SCB; and
(3)    A voluntary online questionnaire that is completed by a global network of reporters. The reporters are countries that do not report to the CRS, as well as multilateral institutions that have large portfolios of statistical projects.
Recipient countries are not required to provide data to the three sources. Donors are encouraged to provide budget-allocation information at sector-level. Multi-lateral donors work closely with PARIS21 to complete the online questionnaire to feed better and more complete data to source (3).
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
This indicator is calculated as the sum of all project/program disbursements for statistical capacity building in developing countries in a given year. All values are converted to US dollars using the average currency conversion rate of the time period (given year) for which the indicator is being calculated. 
Comments and limitations:
Financial figures presented in the PRESS are drawn from the OECD’s Creditor Reporting System (CRS) for Official Development Assistance (ODA) commitments, supplemented by voluntary reporting from other donors. Therefore, full coverage of all programs is uncertain. 
The reported comments are also an upper-bound to the actual support to statistics. This is because of three reasons: (1) double counting of projects may occur when the donor and project implementer report on the same project or when all project co-financers report project totals; (2) the reported numbers may be inflated by working with project totals for multi-sector projects that have a small statistics component; and (3) the PRESS reports on donor-side commitments which do not always translate to actual disbursements to the recipient countries. 
The indicator only captures international support to statistics and does not account for domestic resources. 
Due to different fiscal calendars among donors, the data has a 2-year lag. 
Proxy, alternative and additional indicators: N/A
Data Disaggregation
This indicator can be disaggregated by geographical area, ODA sectors, area of statistics and method of financing (e.g. grant, loan etc.). 
Indicator 17.2.1: Net official development assistance, total and to least developed countries, as a proportion of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee donors' gross national income (GNI)
Target 17.2: Developed countries to implement fully their official development assistance commitments, including the commitment by many developed countries to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national income for official development assistance (ODA/GNI) to developing countries and 0.15 to 0.20 per cent of ODA/GNI to least developed countries; ODA providers are encouraged to consider setting a target to provide at least 0.20 per cent of ODA/GNI to least developed countries
Goal 17: Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the percentage of the Gross National Incomes (GNI) of the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee’s (DAC) donor members that is disbursed as Official Development Assistance (ODA) to all developing countries and least developed countries. 
Concepts:
The DAC defines ODA as those flows to countries and territories on the DAC list of ODA recipients and multilateral institutions which are:
(1)    Provided by official agencies, including state and local governments, or by their executive agencies; and
(2)    Each transaction of which:
a. is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; and
b. is concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25 percent (calculated at a rate of discount of 10%). 
Gross National Income (GNI) is defined as the sum of a country’s gross domestic product plus net income received from overseas. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
Target 17.2 measures the commitment by many developed countries to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent of ODA/GNI and 0.15-0.20 per cent of ODA/GNI to the least developed countries. 
Data Sources and Collection Method
The OECD/DAC has been collecting data on official and private resource flows from 1960 at an aggregate level and 1973 at an activity level through the CRS (CRS data are considered complete from 1995 for commitments at an activity level and 2002 for disbursements). 
A statistical reporter is responsible for the collection of DAC statistics in each providing country/agency. This reporter is usually located in the national aid agency, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or Finance etc. 
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
The percentage of GNI disbursed as ODA (PODA) is calculated using the following formula: 
￼
where i denotes net ODA Disbursements. 
This indicator is calculated for each DAC member donor country as well as other non-DAC providers that report their ODA to the OECD. 
Comments and limitations:
The data are available in OECD DAC aggregate databases from 1960.

Indicator 17.6.2: Fixed internet broadband subscriptions per 100 inhabitants, by speed
Target 17.6: Enhance North-South, South-South and triangular regional and international cooperation on and access to science, technology and innovation and enhance knowledge-sharing on mutually agreed terms, including through improved coordination among existing mechanisms, in particular at the United Nations level, and through a global technology facilitation mechanism
Goal 17: Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the number of fixed internet broadband connections/subscriptions of different speed tiers per 100 inhabitants of a country. The speed tiers considered are advertised downstream speeds of:
(1)    256 Kilobits per second (Kbps) to 2Megabits per second (Mbps);
(2)    2Mbps to 10 Mbps; and
(3)    Greater than 10 Mbps. 
Concepts:
Fixed internet broadband refers to subscriptions to high-speed access to public internet at downstream speeds greater than 256Kbps. It includes cable modem, DSL, fiber-to-the-home, other fixed (wired) broadband, satellite broadband and terrestrial fixed wireless broadband. It does not include internet access through mobile-cellular networks, and includes both residential and organizational subscriptions. 
Advertised downstream speeds refers to the speed advertised by the Internet service providers at which data (including files, web sites, pictures, music, movies, etc) could be delivered to Internet subscribers. The advertised speed can differ from the actual speed of connection that a user may experience at the time of Internet use. 
Rationale and Interpretation: 
The internet has become an increasingly important tool to provide access to information that can help foster and enhance regional and international cooperation and access, particularly in the contexts of science, technology, innovations, through knowledge sharing. Limits to broadband connections is a barrier to target 17.6, and therefore, the measurement of the number of broadband connections provides insight into the level of enabling environment for such cooperation.  
Data Sources and Collection Method
National regulatory authorities or Information and Communication Technology (ICT) ministries collect this data from the administrative systems of internet service providers. This data is then aggregated to get national-level figures. 
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
The number of fixed internet broadband connections/subscriptions per 100 inhabitants of a country (Nbroadband) can be calculated as: 
￼
This indicator is to be calculated for the three suggested downstream speed brackets separately. 
Comments and limitations:
Since most internet service providers offer plans linked to download speed, the indicator is easy to disaggregate by speed. It is possible that the speed brackets that are used by countries for this indicator may be different than what are proposed here. For such countries, it is advised to collect data for more speed categories such that it can be aggregated easily to the suggested brackets.

Indicator 17.8.1: Proportion of individuals using the internet 
Target 17.8: Fully operationalize the technology bank and science, technology and innovation capacity building mechanism for least developed countries by 2017 and enhance the use of enabling technology, in particular information and communications technology
Goal 17: Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development
Definition and Rationale
Definition: 
This indicator is defined as the percentage of people who have used the internet from any location in the last three months, using any internet-capable device 
Concepts:
Internet access refers to the utilization of the world wide web, e-mail, news, entertainment and data files, and other services using the worldwide public computer network using any device (not just a computer), via a fixed or mobile-cellular network. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
The proportion of individuals using the internet is an established indicator that is considered a key metric for international comparisons of ICT developments. It is a direct measure of the level of enhancement to the use of development enabling information and communication technologies. 
Data Sources and Collection Method
The data for this internet is collected through nationally representative household surveys that are conducted by the national statistical offices or the ministries of ICT of countries.
There are various types of household surveys that can be used to collect data on individuals using the Internet.  Two main types can be distinguished: stand-alone surveys focused on ICT, and other household surveys that may contain some questions on ICT topics.
	1.	Stand-alone household surveys dealing with ICT access and use allow for more details to be collected than is usually possible in an existing survey vehicle designed for investigating other topics. An ICT household survey can have a customized sample design, while the information gathered through other surveys will depend on the design of those surveys. The advantages and disadvantages of specific ICT surveys compared to the inclusion of ICT questions in existing survey vehicles are discussed below.
	2.	Surveys not specific to ICT include, such as:
	•	Multipurpose household surveys that collect data on more than one subject via a single household survey. Such as the World Bank’s Living Standard Measurement Survey (LSMS). Other than the LSMS, particular surveys that are sometimes used for collecting ICT household data in developing economies include Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) funded by UNICEF, and other multi-topic surveys carried out by national statistical offices.
	•	Household budget surveys. Household expenditure (budget) surveys are designed to measure household expenditure and are also used by a number of countries to identify household access to ICT equipment and services.  Some countries include questions on household income in their household expenditure surveys.
Population censuses. Population censuses can be used to collect a small number of ICT access and/or use data items. Although this is usually an expensive option and population censuses are infrequent (usually once in a decade), it remains a good alternative in countries that have never collected any ICT household data and are not planning to do so in the near future. In addition, population censuses provide very good detail about the variables collected and can provide a basis for the design of samples for future ICT-specific surveys.
The international Telecommunication Union (ITU) gathers this data from national focal points in countries, and also estimates values for countries that have not conducted surveys, employing methods such as time-series forecasts, hot-deck imputation and regression models, by utilizing socio-economic indicators like the number of internet subscriptions, Gross National Income per capita etc. 
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
The percentage of people who have accessed the internet from any location in the last three mon ths (Pinternet) can be calculated as: 
￼
Comments and limitations:
This indicator is currently estimated for countries that do not yet collect this data through household surveys. ITU encourages all countries to collect data on this indicator through official surveys.

Data Disaggregation
This indicator can be disaggregated by geographic location (rural/urban), sex, age group, educational level, labour force status and occupation. 
SDG 17: Global Partnerships

A successful sustainable development agenda requires partnerships between governments, the private sector and civil society. These inclusive partnerships built upon principles and values, a shared vision, and shared goals that place people and the planet at the centre, are needed at the global, regional, national and local level.

Urgent action is needed to mobilize, redirect and unlock the transformative power of trillions of dollars of private resources to deliver on sustainable development objectives. Long-term investments, including foreign direct investment, are needed in critical sectors, especially in developing countries. These include sustainable energy, infrastructure and transport, as well as information and communications technologies. The public sector will need to set a clear direction. Review and monitoring frameworks, regulations and incentive structures that enable such investments must be retooled to attract investments and reinforce sustainable development. National oversight mechanisms such as supreme audit institutions and oversight functions by legislatures should be strengthened.


Official development assistance stood at $135.2 billion in 2014, the highest level ever recorded
79 per cent of imports from developing countries enter developed countries duty-free
The debt burden on developing countries remains stable at about 3 per cent of export revenue
The number of Internet users in Africa almost doubled in the past four years
30 per cent of the worlds youth are digital natives, active online for at least five years
But more four billion people do not use the Internet, and 90 per cent of them are from the developing world
Goal 17 targets

PARTNERSHIPS
To revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development
In 2015, world leaders adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development that aims to end poverty, tackle inequalities and combat climate change. We need everyone to come togethergovernments, civil society, scientists, academia and the private sector to achieve the sustainable development goals.
We are all in this together. The Agenda, with its 17 Sustainable Development Goals, is universal and calls for action by all countries, both developed countries and developing countries, to ensure no one is left behind.
As partners, what would we need to do to achieve the Agenda?
We will need to mobilize both existing and additional resources technology development, financial resources, capacity building and developed countries will need to fulfill their official development assistance commitments. Multistakeholder partnerships will be crucial to leverage the inter-linkages between the Sustainable Development Goals to enhance their effectiveness and impact and accelerate progress in achieving the Goals.
How can we ensure the resources needed are effectively mobilized and monitored?
This will be primarily the responsibility of countries. Reviews of progress will need to be undertaken regularly in each country, involving civil society, business and representatives of various interest groups. At the regional level, countries will share experiences and tackle common issues, while on an annual basis, at the United Nations, the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), they will take stock of progress at the global level, identifying gaps and emerging issues, and recommending corrective action.
Join/create a group in your local community that seeks to mobilize action on the implementation of the SDGs.
Encourage your governments to partner with businesses for the implementation of the SDGs.
Register your initiatives on the SDGs Partnerships Platform to inform, educate, network, and be inspired! 








Goal 17. Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development 
Achieving the ambitious targets of the 2030 Agenda requires a revitalized and enhanced global partnership that brings together Governments, civil society, the private sector, the United Nations system and other actors and mobilizes all available resources. Enhancing support to developing countries, in particular the least developed countries and the small island developing States, is fundamental to equitable progress for all. 

Finance 
In 2015, net ODA from member countries of the Development Assistance Committee of OECD totalled $131.6 billion. Taking account of inflation and the rise in the value of the dollar in 2015, this was 6.9 per cent higher in real terms than in 2014, and represented the highest level ever reached. Total ODA from those countries as a share of their gross national income was 0.30 per cent, on par with 2014. Most of the increase was owing to higher expenditures for costs associated with refugees. However, even if those costs are excluded, ODA still rose by 1.7 per cent. Seven countries met the United Nations target for ODA of 0.7 per cent of gross national income in 2015: Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom.

Information and communications technology
Fixed-broadband services remain largely unaffordable and unavailable across much of the population in developing regions, highlighting digital divides in access to high-speed, high-capacity Internet services. By 2015, fixed-broadband penetration had reached 29 per cent in developed regions, but only 7.1 per cent and 0.5 per cent, respectively, in developing regions and the least developed countries. Major disparities are also found in Internet use. In developing regions, one third of the population is online versus 1 in 10 people in the least developed countries. Data also reveal that more men than women are online. In 2015, globally, the Internet user penetration rate was about 11 per cent lower for women than for men. The gender gap is even higher in developing regions (15 per cent) and highest in the least developed countries (29 per cent). 
Capacity-building
Net ODA for capacity-building and national planning amounted to $23 billion in 2014; of that total, sub-Saharan Africa received $6 billion and Southern and Central Asia received $4.6 billion. The main sectors receiving assistance were public administration, environment and energy, which together were allocated a total of $9.3 billion. 

Trade	
The weighted average of applied tariffs has been decreasing over time, but still varies widely across regions and country groups on main product sectors. Average agricultural tariffs on imports coming into Asia, for instance, are the highest in the world, at around 27 per cent for Southern Asia and 20 per cent for Eastern Asia in 2015, under most-favoured nation status. In 14 years, the least developed countries share in world merchandise exports nearly doubled, from 0.6 per cent in 2000 to 1.1 per cent in 2014. The key driver of export growth during that period was a massive rise in the price of fuel, ores and metals, reflecting a high demand in developing countries, notably China. In services, the least developed countries increased their share of world exports to 0.8 per cent in 2014 ($40 billion), up from 0.5 per cent in 2005. 

Data, monitoring and accountability
The requirements of the indicators developed in the context of the Millennium Development Goals have fostered stronger national statistical plans and systems. The number of countries with a national statistical plan increased in some regions between 2010 and 2015, including in sub-Saharan Africa and the least developed countries. However, the overall number of plans declined from 56 to 54 among the countries being observed, since the time period of some existing plans expired. Financial support for statistical capacity amounted to $325 million in 2013, compared with $379 million in 2010. However, assistance to the least developed countries, in this regard, tripled during the period and reached $265 million. Despite an increasing awareness of the importance of statistics for evidence-based policymaking and development, the share of ODA dedicated to statistics hovered at around 0.3 per cent between 2010 and 2013.Population and housing censuses are a primary source of the disaggregated data needed for formulating, implementing and monitoring development policies and programmes. During the 10-year period spanning from 2006 to 2015, 90 per cent of countries or areas around the world conducted at least one population and housing census. Over the period 2005-2014, birth registration data were available for 183 out of 230 countries or areas, whereas death registration data were available for 157. Only 58 per cent of developing countries with available data have birth registration coverage of 90 per cent or more; 71 per cent of developing countries with available data have death registration coverage of 75 per cent or more. Sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest levels of complete birth and death registration. 
Goal 17. Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development 


21.	Despite some positive developments, a stronger commitment to partnership and cooperation is needed to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. That effort will require coherent policies, an enabling environment for sustainable development at all levels and by all actors and a reinvigorated Global Partnership for Sustainable Development.

		Finance

		In 2016, net ODA from member countries of the Development Assistance Committee of OECD rose by 8.9 per cent in real terms to $142.6 billion, reaching a new peak. ODA as a percentage of member countries gross national income was 0.32 per cent, up from 0.30 per cent in 2015. The rise in aid spent on refugees in donor countries boosted the total. But even leaving aside refugee costs, aid rose 7.1 per cent. In 2016, Germany joined five other countries  Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom  in meeting a United Nations target to keep ODA at or above 0.7 per cent of gross national income.
		Remittances sent by international migrants to their home countries in the form of personal transfers and compensation of employees have a profound impact on individual families, communities and countries. In 2016, international remittances totalled $575 billion, 75 per cent ($429 billion) of which went to developing countries, according to the latest estimates. 

		Information and communications technology 

		Fixed-broadband services remain largely unaffordable and unavailable throughout large segments of the developing world. In 2016, fixed-broadband penetration reached 30 per cent in developed regions, but only reached 8.2 per cent and 0.8 per cent in developing regions and the least developed countries, respectively. In developed regions, about 80 per cent of the population is online, compared to 40 per cent in developing regions and 15 per cent in the least developed countries. In 2016, the global rate of Internet user penetration was 12 per cent lower for women than men. The gender gap remains even larger in the least developed countries, at 31 per cent.

		Capacity-building 

		Total ODA for capacity-building and national planning stood at $21 billion in 2015. That amount represented 19 per cent of total aid allocable by sector, a proportion that has been stable since 2010. Of the total, sub-Saharan Africa received $5.6 billion and South and Central Asia received $4.2 billion. The main recipients of assistance were the public administration, environment and energy sectors, which together were provided with a total of $8.2 billion. 

		Trade 

		During the past 15 years, developing regions have represented a growing share of international trade, with their world merchandise exports increasing from 31.1 per cent in 2001 to 44.6 per cent in 2015. Moreover, developing regions overall have maintained a trade surplus vis--vis the rest of the world. For the least developed countries, however, the share in world merchandise exports decreased from 1.1 per cent to 0.9 per cent from 2011 to 2015. Much of that change can be attributed to the fall in commodity prices. 
		In 2015, average tariffs applied by developed countries to imports from the least developed countries remained stable at 0.9 per cent for agricultural products, 6.5 per cent for clothing and 3.2 per cent for textiles. Average tariffs applied by developed countries to imports from developing countries also remained largely unchanged in 2015. 

		Systemic issues 

		In 2016, 125 countries engaged in country-led monitoring of development effectiveness, which demonstrates their commitment to strengthening implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals and multi-stakeholder partnerships; 54 of those countries reported overall progress towards those commitments. Countries own result frameworks were used to define 83 per cent of new interventions supported by donor countries in 2016. 

		Data, monitoring and accountability 

		More than half of the countries or areas (81 of 154 countries) for which information is available were implementing national statistical plans in 2016. However, only 37 of 83 countries or areas with pertinent data had national statistical legislation in place that complied with all 10 Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics. 
		In 2014, developing countries received $338 million in financial support for statistics. While that amount represented an increase of nearly 2.9 per cent from 2010, it accounted for only 0.18 per cent of total ODA. In order to meet the data requirements of the Sustainable Development Goals, developing countries will need an estimated $1 billion in statistical support annually from domestic and donor sources.
		Population and housing censuses are a primary source of disaggregated data needed to formulate, implement and monitor development policies and programmes. During the 10-year period from 2007 to 2016, 89 per cent of countries or areas around the world conducted at least one population and housing census, while 25 countries or areas did not have such a fundamental data source.
		During the period from 2010 to 2015, more than half (56 per cent) of the worlds countries or areas (138 of 246 countries) had birth registration data that were at least 90 per cent complete. In sub-Saharan Africa, only 8 of 53 countries reached that level of coverage. During the same period, 144 countries or areas, or 59 per cent, had death registration data that were at least 75 per cent complete. In sub-Saharan Africa, only 9 in 53 countries met that standard. Even in countries with functioning civil registration systems, coverage of birth and death registration and complete reporting of vital statistics remain a challenge. 
		Goal 17. Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development
Goal 17 seeks to strengthen global partnerships to support and achieve the ambitious targets of the 2030 Agenda, bringing together national Governments, the international community, civil society, the private sector and other actors. Despite some advances in certain areas, more needs to be done to accelerate progress. All stakeholders will have to intensify and focus their efforts on the areas where progress has been slow. 
		Finance
Taxation is an important instrument in financing domestic development activities. However, the regions most in need of resources still face challenges in collecting taxes. The rate of taxation (ratio of tax revenue to GDP) in the least developed countries declined from a peak of 11.1 per cent in 2012 to 8.8 per cent in 2016. Countries in sub-Saharan Africa faced a similar trend: a decline from 14.9 per cent in 2006 to 10.7 per cent in 2016.In 2017, net ODA from member countries of the Development Assistance Committee of OECD totalled $146.6 billion, a decrease of 0.6 per cent from the 2016 level in real terms. ODA as a share of donors gross national income remained low, at 0.31 per cent. Only five Development Assistance Committee countries  Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom  met or exceeded the United Nations benchmark for ODA contributions of at least 0.7 per cent of gross national income. Remittances sent by international migrants to their home countries in the form of personal transfers and compensation of employees have declined to $538 billion (0.72 per cent of global GDP) in 2016 from $555 billion in 2015. Recent trends of stricter immigration policies in many migrant-destination countries continue to constrain the flow of remittances.Debt service as a proportion of exports of goods and services has been on the rise for five consecutive years in the least developed countries: from a low of 3.5 per cent in 2011 to 8.6 per cent in 2016. The recent upward trend followed a decade-long decline in debt service from its height of 13.4 per cent in 2001. The ability to sustainably service debts out of export earnings is crucial for countries most in need of resources for development.
		Information and communications technology
Despite the worldwide increase in fixed broadband subscriptions, access to high-speed connections remains largely unavailable in the developing countries. In 2016, high-speed fixed broadband penetration reached 6 per cent of the population in developing countries, compared with 24 per cent in developed countries. Limitations in the capacity and speed of fixed broadband connections will affect the quality and functionality of this development tool and widen the already existing inequalities.
		Capacity-building
Total ODA for capacity-building and national planning amounted to $20.4 billion in 2016 and represented 18 per cent of total aid allocable by sector, a proportion that has been stable since 2010. Of the total, Latin America and the Caribbean received $5.1 billion, sub-Saharan Africa received $4.6 billion and Southern Asia received $3.8 billion. The three main sectors assisted were public administration, environment and energy, which received a total of $10.2 billion.
		Trade
The latest available data show that tariffs applied under preferential trade agreements, which include bilateral and regional free trade agreements, have been declining over time. In 2016, the trade-weighted average preferential tariff rate applied to imports from the least developed countries was 7.9 per cent, a 2 percentage point drop from the 2005 level. For developing regions, the average preferential tariff rate dropped by 1.2 percentage points during the same period.The stagnation in global trade since 2011 has been followed and accompanied by a break in the expansion of the world market shares of developing regions and the least developed countries. The developing regions share in world merchandise exports declined for two consecutive years: from 45.4 per cent in 2014 to 44.2 per cent in 2016, in sharp contrast to an average annual 1.2 percentage point increase from 2001 to 2012. For the least developed countries, the share of world merchandise exports decreased from 1.1 per cent to 0.9 per cent from 2013 to 2016, compared with the rise from 0.6 per cent to 1.1 per cent from 2000 to 2013.
		Systemic issues
Development partners should align their support with Governments national development strategies and results frameworks, in particular in fragile countries in respect of countries own policy space and path towards sustainable development. In 2016, 82 per cent of new development projects had objectives aligned with national priorities. However, more than half of the projects relied on parallel systems and data to monitor progress and development results, instead of integrating these efforts as part of national statistical and monitoring systems. In 2016, 81 developing countries undertook national exercises to monitor development effectiveness, demonstrating their commitment to strengthening the means for Sustainable Development Goal implementation and the quality of multistakeholder partnerships. Half of the countries showing overall progress are fragile States and small island developing States.
		Data, monitoring and accountability 
In 2017, 102 countries or areas were implementing national statistical plans. Sub-Saharan Africa remains at the lead of implementation with 31 countries implementing such plans; however only 3 of them were fully funded.In 2015, developing countries received $541 million in financial support from multilateral and bilateral donors for all areas of statistics. This amount accounts for only 0.3 per cent of total ODA, short of what is needed to ensure that countries in developing regions are better equipped to implement and monitor their development agenda.Population and housing censuses are a primary source of disaggregated data needed to formulate, implement and monitor development policies and programmes. During the 10-year span from 2008 to 2017, 89 per cent of countries or areas around the world conducted at least one population and housing census.
148.	The coverage of birth and death registration and the completeness of vital statistics remain a challenge, even among countries with functioning civil registration systems. For the period 20122016, 143 countries have birth registration data that are at least 90 per cent complete and 148 countries have death registration data that are at least 75 per cent complete. In sub-Saharan Africa, only 8 out of 53 countries have birth registration data that are at least 90 per cent complete, and only 9 out of 53 countries have death registration data that are at least 75 per cent complete.
