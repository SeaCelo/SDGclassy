Indicator 3.1.1: Maternal mortality ratio
Target 3.1: By 2030, reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births
Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) is defined as the annual number of maternal deaths from any cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy or its management (excluding accidental or incidental causes) during pregnancy and childbirth or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, per 100,000 live births, for a specified year. 
Concepts:
A maternal death refers to a female death from any cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy or its management (excluding accidental or incidental causes) during pregnancy and childbirth or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy. It is important to note that not all deaths which occur temporally to pregnancy are considered "maternal deaths". Maternal deaths are a specific subset of deaths which occur during pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium and can be further divided into two groups, namely direct and indirect obstetric deaths. Direct obstetric deaths result from obstetric complications of the pregnant state (pregnancy, labour and puerperium); from interventions, omissions or direct treatment; or from a chain of events resulting in any of these. Indirect deaths result from previously existing disease or disease that developed during pregnancy and was not directly due to obstetric causes but was aggravated by the physiologic effects of pregnancy. Deaths which do not meet these criteria, such as those which occur as a result of accidents, are defined by the more general term, "death occurring in pregnancy, childbirth or the puerperium" (previously referred to as "pregnancy related deaths") and are excluded from the definition of maternal health.
A live birth is the complete expulsion or extraction from its mother of a product of conception, irrespective of the duration of the pregnancy, which, after such separation, breathes or shows any other evidence of life—such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles—whether or not the umbilical cord has been cut or the placenta is attached. Each product of such a birth is considered a live birth.
Rationale and Interpretation:
This indicator monitors deaths related to pregnancy and childbirth. It reflects the capacity of health systems to provide effective health care in preventing and addressing the complications occurring during pregnancy and childbirth. 
Indicator values range from less than 10 in most developed countries, with an average of around 169 per 100,000 live births in the developing regions.
Data Sources and Collection Method
Primary sources of data include CRSV, population based household surveys, reproductive age mortality studies, disease surveillance or sample registration systems, special studies on maternal mortality, and national population censuses. Complete CRSV systems with accurate cause of death estimations are the most reliable data source for calculating maternal mortality and monitoring change over time. However, these are rare in developing countries. Official data are usually available from health service records, but in some locations few women in rural areas have access to health services. Therefore, in developing countries, survey data, especially those from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and similar household surveys constitute the most common source of data on maternal mortality. 
Because maternal mortality is a relatively rare event, large sample sizes are needed when data are derived from household surveys. This is very costly and may still result in estimates with large confidence intervals. 
The sisterhood method, used in DHS surveys and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), reduces sample size requirements by asking survey respondents about the survivorship of sisters. Respondents are asked four simple questions about how many of their sisters reached adulthood, how many have died and whether those who died were pregnant at the time of death.  While this method reduces sample size requirements, it produces estimates covering some 7-12 years before the survey, which renders data problematic for monitoring progress or observing the impact of interventions. The direct sisterhood method asks respondents to provide date of death, which permits the calculation of more recent estimates, but even then, the reference period tends to refer to 0-6 years before the survey.
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
The maternal mortality ratio is calculated by dividing recorded (or estimated) maternal deaths by total recorded (or estimated) live births in the same period and multiplying by 100,000. The measurement requires information on pregnancy status, timing of death (during pregnancy, during childbirth, or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy), and cause of death. The following formula is used for calculating the maternal mortality ratio for a given time period:
 ￼
Comments and limitations:
Maternal mortality is often difficult to measure. Civil Registration Vital Statistics (CRVS) and health information systems in most developing countries are weak, and thus, cannot provide an accurate assessment of maternal mortality. Even figures derived from complete CRVS systems, such as those in developed countries, suffer from misclassification and underreporting of maternal deaths. 
Due to very large confidence intervals, maternal mortality estimates might not be suitable for assessing trends over time. As a result, it is recommended that country level process indicators, such as attendance by skilled health personnel at delivery and use of health facilities for delivery, be used to supplement maternal mortality ratios for assessing progress towards the reduction in maternal mortality at the country level. 
The maternal mortality ratio should not be confused with the maternal mortality rate (number of maternal deaths divided by person-years lived by women of reproductive age), which reflects not only the risk of maternal death per pregnancy or birth but also the level of fertility in the population. The maternal mortality ratio (whose denominator is the number of live births) indicates the risk of death once a woman becomes pregnant, and does not take fertility levels into consideration. 
Proxy, alternative and additional indicators:
In addition to the MMR and MMRate, there exist two additional indicators:
(1) the adult lifetime risk of maternal mortality for women in the population is defined as the probability that a 15-year old woman will die eventually from a maternal cause; and
(2) the proportion of deaths among women of reproductive age that are due to maternal causes (PM) is calculated as the number of maternal deaths divided by the total deaths among women aged 15-49 years. 
Data Disaggregation
A list of aspirational inequity measurements are proposed for disaggregation such as income level, residence (urban/rural), educational attainment, ethnicity, humanitarian settings, conflict zones and refugees as well as adolescent 15-19 years.
Indicator 3.2.1: Under-five mortality rate
Target 3.2: By 2030, end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age, with all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12 per 1,000 live births and under-5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births
Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
The under-five mortality rate (U5MR) is the probability (expressed as a rate per 1,000 live births) of a child born in a specified year or period dying before reaching the age of five if subject to current age-specific mortality rates. 
Concepts: 
A live birth is the complete expulsion or extraction from its mother of a product of conception, irrespective of the duration of the pregnancy, which, after such separation, breathes or shows any other evidence of life—such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles—whether or not the umbilical cord has been cut or the placenta is attached. Each product of such a birth is considered a live birth. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
Mortality rates among young children are a key output indicator for child health and well-being, and, more broadly, for social and economic development. It is a closely watched public health indicator because it reflects the access of children and communities to basic health interventions such as vaccination, medical treatment of infectious diseases and adequate nutrition. 
By 2030, all countries are expected to reduce under-5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births.
Data Sources and Collection Method
Vital registration systems are the preferred source of data on under-five mortality because they collect information prospectively and cover the entire population. However, many low and lower middle income countries lack fully functioning vital registration systems that accurately record all births and deaths. Thus, household surveys, such as Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), and periodic population censuses have become the primary source of data on child mortality in low and lower middle income countries. 
National Statistical Office or the Ministry of Health are mostly involved in generating under-five mortality data at the national level.
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method: 
Strictly speaking, the U5MR is not rate, since they are not calculated by dividing the number of deaths by the population at risk. Rather, the measures represent the probability of dying by a certain age derived from a life table. 
Two methods for calculating U5MR exist: the direct method and the indirect method. The direct method requires each child’s date of birth, survival status, and date or age at death. This information is typically found in vital registration systems and in household surveys that collect complete birth histories. A complete birth history records the dates of birth, and, if applicable, the dates of death of all children born to each woman that is interviewed. 
There are different direct methods of calculating under-five mortality rates. For data from vital registration systems, the calculation of U5MR can be derived from a standard period abridged life table with the number of deaths for age group <1 year (noted D0) and for the age group 1-4 (D1-4), as well as the mid-year population for the same age groups (P0 and P1-4) as inputs. Survey programmes use a synthetic cohort approach, which combines mortality probabilities for small age segments based on real cohort mortality experience into common age. 
The indirect method requires relatively little information that is available in censuses and several surveys. Only a few short, simple questions are required to collect it. This information consists of the total number of children born to each woman, the number who survive and the woman’s age (or the number of years since she first gave birth). The indirect method -often called the “Brass method”, converts the proportion of reported dead children ever born to women in age groups 15–19, 20–24,… and 45–49 into estimates of the probability of dying before attaining certain ages. The method assumes that the age of the mother can serve as a proxy for the age of her children and thus for how long the children have been exposed to the risk of dying.

Comments and limitations:
Many countries do not have timely and reliable U5MR data but rather have differing mortality rates from different sources. Data from different sources require different calculation methods and may suffer from different errors, for example random errors in sample surveys or systematic errors due to misreporting. Recall errors are common as data are collected retrospectively. As a result, different sources often yield widely different estimates of mortality for a given time period and available data collected by countries are often inconsistent across sources. Therefore, it is important to analyse, reconcile and evaluate all data sources simultaneously for each country. The UN IGME method aims to minimize the errors for each estimate, harmonize trends over time and produce up-to-date and properly assessed estimates of under-five mortality. 
The UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME) uses a Bayesian B-splines biasadjusted model to estimate U5MR. The spline regression model is fitted to all empirical U5MR data from vital registration systems, population censuses, household surveys and sample registration systems in a country, after data quality assessment. The model generates a smooth trend curve that averages over possibly disparate estimates from the different data sources for a country and extrapolates the estimates to a target year. UN IGME generates such estimates with uncertainty bounds. The differences between the UN IGME estimates and national official estimates are usually not large if empirical data has good quality.

Data Disaggregation
Common disaggregation for mortality indicators includes disaggregation by sex, age (neonatal, infant, child), wealth quintile, residence, and mother’s education. Disaggregated data are not always available. Disaggregation by geographic location is usually at regional level, or the minimum provincial level for survey or census data. Data from well-functioning vital registration systems can provide further geographical breakdowns.
Indicator 3.2.2: Neonatal mortality rate
Target 3.2: By 2030, end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age, with all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12 per 1,000 live births and under-5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births
Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
The neonatal mortality rate (NMR) is the probability that a child born in a specific year or period will die during the first 28 completed days of life if subject to current age-specific mortality rates, expressed per 1000 live births. 
Concepts: 
A live birth is the complete expulsion or extraction from its mother of a product of conception, irrespective of the duration of the pregnancy, which, after such separation, breathes or shows any other evidence of life—such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles—whether or not the umbilical cord has been cut or the placenta is attached. Each product of such a birth is considered a live birth. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
Child mortality, including neonatal mortality rate (NMR), is a key output indicator for child health and well-being, and, more broadly, for social and economic development. It is a closely watched public health indicator because it reflects the access of children and communities to basic health interventions such as vaccination, medical treatment of infectious diseases and adequate nutrition. 
Strictly speaking, the NMR is not rate, since they are not calculated by dividing the number of deaths by the population at risk. Rather, the measures represent the probability of dying by a certain age derived from a life table.

National Statistical Office or the Ministry of Health are mostly involved in generating neonatal mortality data at the national level.
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
The direct method requires each child’s date of birth, survival status, and date or age at death. This information is typically found in vital registration systems and in household surveys that collect complete birth histories. A complete birth history records the dates of birth, and, if applicable, the dates of death of all children born to each woman that is interviewed. 
There are different direct methods of calculating neonatal mortality rates. For data from vital registration systems, the calculation of NMR can be derived from the number of deaths of children in the first month during a particular time period is divided by the number of births in that same period. Survey programmes use a synthetic cohort approach, which combines mortality probabilities for small age segments based on real cohort mortality experience into common age. 
Comments and limitations:
Many countries do not have timely and reliable NMR data but rather have differing mortality rates from different sources. Data from different sources may suffer from different errors, for example random errors in sample surveys or systematic errors due to misreporting. Recall errors are common as data are collected retrospectively. As a result, different sources often yield widely different estimates of mortality for a given time period and available data collected by countries are often inconsistent across sources.

The spline regression model is fitted to all empirical data from vital registration systems, population censuses, household surveys and sample registration systems in a country, after data quality assessment. This method models the ratio of neonatal mortality rate / (under-five mortality rate - neonatal mortality rate). The model generates a smooth trend curve that averages over possibly disparate estimates from the different data sources for a country and extrapolates the estimates to a target year. Estimates of NMR are obtained by recombining the estimates of the ratio with UN IGME-estimated under-five mortality rate. UN IGME generates such estimates with uncertainty bounds. The differences between the UN IGME estimates and national official estimates are usually not large if empirical data has good quality.

Common disaggregations for mortality indicators includes disaggregation by sex, wealth quintile, residence, and mother’s education. Disaggregated data are not always available. Disaggregation by geographic location is usually at regional level, or the minimum provincial level for survey or census data. Data from well-functioning vital registration systems can provide further geographical breakdowns. 
Neonatal deaths (deaths among live births during the first 28 completed days of life) may be subdivided into early neonatal deaths, occurring during the first 7 days of life, and late neonatal deaths, occurring after the 7th day but before the 28th completed day of life. 
Neonatal mortality rates can be also disaggregated by cause, including preterm birth complications, pneumonia, and diarrhoea.
Indicator 3.3.1: Number of new HIV infections per 1,000 uninfected population, by sex, age and key populations
Target 3.3: By 2030, end the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases and combat hepatitis, water-borne diseases and other communicable diseases
Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the number of new HIV infections per 1,000 uninfected population. 
Concepts:
Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a virus that weakens the immune system, ultimately leading to Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). HIV destroys the body’s ability to fight off infection and disease, which can ultimately lead to death. Without treatment, median survival from the time of infection is about 10.5 years for males and 11.5 years for females. Access to treatment improves the health of the individual, increases survival to near normal life expectancies, and greatly reduces the chance of onward transmission. Treatment coverage has increased rapidly since the early 2000s but still varies by region. No vaccine is currently available. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
Monitoring the incidence rate of HIV provides a measure of progress toward achieving the target of reducing the number of new HIV infections. 
Data Sources and Collection Method
Teams of epidemiologist and HIV specialists in each country are responsible for producing the HIV estimates using comparable models. The models start with the most recent UN Popualtion Division estimates of population by age, sex and year. Programme data on the numbers of people receiving antiretroviral medicines are also entered into the model. The HIV surveillance data used in the model to estimate incidence vary depending on what data are available in the country; however the model primarily relies on HIV prevalence measures or case surveilance or mortality reports.   
Measuring HIV infections directly requires conducting large household surveys each year and is a very challenging endevour(for example In countries with low prevalence the sample sizes would need to be well over 100,000 households). 
Further information on the estimation model can be found at:
http://www.unaids.org/en/dataanalysis/datatools/spectrum-epp or www.epidem.org
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
This indicator is calculated using the following formula for a given reporting period: 
 ￼
There are a number of direct methods of measuring incidence, including the two most common:
(1)    Longitudinal follow-up of individuals who do not have HIV – This method involves repeated testing of a selected cohort of uninfected individuals to determine the proportion that has acquired infection over time; and
(2)    Application of laboratory tests for recent HIV infection – This method involves using  laboratory tests to  distinguish  recent infections (i.e., from within the last year) from long-standing infections. 
The first method is challenging because it will require following and testing a nationally-representative number of people regularly over time. The sample of individuals monitored would have to be large to allow for meaningful inference from the results. The second method has the potential to misclassify individuals as newly infected even though their infections have been longstanding due to limitations in the performance of currently available laboratory tests. In addition, a very large, nationally-representative sample of individuals  is required to calculate a meaningful value.  This is possible in some very high HIV burden countries although it is unlikely that conducting this large of a survey could be done on an annual basis. In addition, many people do not get tested regularly or after every possible exposure. 
Given these challenges an indirect method based on mathematical modeling is currently used to estimate HIV incidence in most countries. Comparable modeled estimates of HIV incidence are available for countries representing 99% of the global population. Country teams produce the modelled estimates and national HIV programme managers approve  them before they are compiled and published by UNAIDS. 
Comments and limitations:
Global HIV surveillance experts have developed models to infer current and historical HIV incidence (see www.epidem.org for more details on these models).  For many countries, including the high HIV burden countries, data on HIV prevalence, direct measures of incidence from national population surveys, where available, and antiretroviral coverage are used to estimate HIV incidence. In other countries with robust case surveillance and vital registration systems, data on HIV diagnosis and cause-specific mortality are used to estimate incidence trends. Both methods have limitations as they rely on assumptions and model parameters to overcome challenges of sub-optimal data inputs. 
Some nationally-representative household surveys are periodically measuring recent HIV infections directly.  These surveys require large sample sizes to accurately measure incidence. There are still some technical uncertainties on how to adjust for false positives among the samples identified as recent infections and these measures are typically not available annually.  
Proxy, alternative and additional indicators: N/A
Data Disaggregation
Disaggregation should be by age groups (0-14, 15-24, 15-49, 50+ years), place of residence, sex, mode of transmission (including mother-to-child transmission). A critical further disaggregation is by key populations (men who have sex with men, sex workers, people who inject drugs, transgender people, and prisoners) and within these groups by ages (< 25, 25+ years). 
Indicator 3.3.2: Tuberculosis incidence per 100,000 population
Target 3.3: By 2030, end the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases and combat hepatitis, water-borne diseases and other communicable diseases
Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
The tuberculosis incidence per 100,000 population is defined as the estimated number of new and relapse  tuberculosis (TB) cases (all forms of TB, including cases in people living with HIV) arising in a given year, expressed as a rate per 100, 000 population. 
Concepts:
Tuberculosis is an infectious bacterial disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which most commonly affects the lungs. It is transmitted from person to person via droplets from the throat and lungs of people with the active respiratory disease. 
A tuberculosis case is defined as a patient in whom tuberculosis has been bacteriologically confirmed or diagnosed by a clinician. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
Detecting tuberculosis and curing it are key interventions for addressing poverty and inequality. Prevalence and deaths are more sensitive markers of the changing burden of tuberculosis than incidence (new cases), but data on incidence are more comprehensive and give the best overview of the impact of global tuberculosis control.   Incidence rates are important because they give an indication of the extent of TB in a population, and of the size of the task faced by a national TB control programme. Incidence rates can be used to track changes in the rate at which people infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis develop TB disease. Improvement in the quality of TB surveillance data result in reduced uncertainty about indicator values. 
Data Sources and Collection Method
International organizations like the WHO collect data from the following four national sources:
1. National case notification data (available in all countries) combined with expert opinion about case detection gaps;
2. Results from recent national TB prevalence surveys where available;
3. National case notifications in high­income countries adjusted by a standard factor to account for under­reporting and under­diagnosis; and
4. Capture recapture modelling using data on TB case detection from at least three case lists (e.g. record-linkage of records from a national TB case notification database, health insurance records, laboratory records, records from private hospital and clinics).
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method: 
Direct measurement of incidence of TB presents major logistic and financial challenges associated with large sample size surveys. Theoretically, data from TB surveillance systems that are linked to health systems of high coverage and performance may capture all (or almost all) incident cases of TB. 
Current methods to estimate TB incidence can be grouped into four major categories. Estimation methods are detailed in an online technical appendix attached to the latest Global TB Report.
1. Case notification data combined with expert opinion about case detection gaps. Expert opinion, elicited in regional workshops or country missions, is used to estimate levels of under-reporting and under-diagnosis. Trends are estimated using either mortality data, surveys of the annual risk of infection or exponential interpolation using estimates of case detection gaps for three years; 
2. Results from TB prevalence surveys. Incidence is estimated using prevalence survey results and derived from a model that accounts for the impact of HIV on the distribution of disease duration; 
3. Notifications in high-income countries adjusted by a standard factor to account for under-reporting and under-diagnosis; and 
4. Results from inventory studies of under-reporting of detected TB, with capture-recapture modelling based on at least three lists. 
Comments and limitations:
N/A 
Proxy, alternative and additional indicators:
Proxy indicators of TB incidence include case notification rates in countries meeting the following criteria: universal access to health care (with universal health insurance or equivalent), mandatory notification of new cases to public health authorities and high performance of the national TB surveillance system.
Data Disaggregation
This indicator can be by age and sex categories, and could be disaggregated by type of TB infection (for example drug resistant vs. non-resistant).
Indicator 3.3.5: Number of people requiring interventions against neglected tropical diseases
Target 3.3: By 2030, end the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases and combat hepatitis, water-borne diseases and other communicable diseases
Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the number of people requiring treatment and care for any one of the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) targeted by the WHO NTD Roadmap and World Health Assembly resolutions. 
Concepts:
Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a diverse group of communicable diseases that prevail in tropical and subtropical conditions in more than 100 countries. They include the following diseases: Buruli ulcer, Chagas disease, dengue, dracunculiasis (guinea-worm disease), echinococcosis, foodborne trematodiases, human African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), leishmaniases, leprosy, lymphatic filariasis, mycetoma, onchocerciasis (river blindness), rabies, schistosomiasis, soil-transmitted helminthiases, taeniasis and neurocysticercosis, trachoma, and yaws. An up-to-date list is available at http://www.who.int/neglected_diseases/diseases/en/. 
Treatment and care is defined as preventive, curative, surgical or rehabilitative measures against the NTDs. It consists of:
(1) Mass treatment known as preventive chemotherapy (PC) for at least one NTD; and
(2) Individual treatment and care for any NTD. 
PC consists of the regular, large-scale administration of drugs - either alone or in combination, to entire population groups, with the aim of reducing transmission and associated morbidity; PC is the public health strategy recommended by WHO against some helminth infections (lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis and soil transmitted helminthiasis) and one chlamydial infection (trachoma). 
Other key interventions against NTDs (e.g. vector management, veterinary public health, water, sanitation and hygiene) are to be addressed in the context of other targets and indicators, namely Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and universal access to water and sanitation. 
Rationale and Interpretation: 
The “end of the epidemic” of NTDs will be evidenced first by decreases in the number of people requiring treatment and care, as NTDs are eradicated, eliminated or controlled.
However, this indicator should not be interpreted as the number of people at risk for NTDs. The number of people at risk is larger. Instead, this number represents the people at a level of risk that requires medical interventions – i.e., treatment and care for NTDs.
The number should be decreasing over time towards zero. Global targets imply a 90% reduction by 2030. 
Data Sources and Collection Method
Data for this indicator is compiled by relevant government agencies such as the ministry of health, through national NTD programs. 
For NTDs requiring mass treatment (PC): WHO’s Joint Request for Selected PC Medicines (JRSM) program supports countries in securing medicines through donations from pharmaceutical companies for NTD treatments. In such cases, it includes data on the number of people requiring PC. In other cases, the WHO has designed the PC Epidemiological Data Reporting Form (EPIRF) to help governments standardize and report their epidemiological data, including data on the number of people requiring PC. 
For NTDs requiring individual treatment and care: the District Health Information System (DHIS, version 2) enables accurate and timely dissemination of data on the number of cases requiring treatment and care for NTDs, from the district level up to national level. WHO is working to support the use of the DHIS2 to allow for prompt collection, flow, analysis and sharing of data by national NTD programmes.
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
This indicator is calculated as the higher of the below two numbers for a given region/administrative unit:
(1)    Average annual number of people requiring mass treatment for at least one NTD. People may require PC for more than one NTD. To avoid double-counting, the number of people requiring PC is therefore compared across the NTDs, by age group and implementation unit (e.g. district). The largest number of people requiring PC among all NTDs is retained for each age group in each implementation unit. The largest number is considered to be a conservative estimate of the number of people requiring PC for at least one NTD; and
(2)    Number of new cases requiring individual treatment and care for any NTD. Currently, the number of new cases is based on country reports, whenever available, of new and known cases of Buruli ulcer, Chagas disease, cysticercosis, dengue, guinea-worm disease, echinococcosis, human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), leprosy, the leishmaniases, rabies and yaws. 
Comments and limitations:
Country reports may not be perfectly comparable over time. Improved surveillance and case-finding may lead to an apparent increase in the number of people known to require treatment and care. Some further estimation may be required to adjust for changes in surveillance and case-finding. Missing country reports may need to be imputed for some diseases in some years.

Data Disaggregation
Data can be disaggregated by disease and by age group. Data can also be disaggregated by sex and location (urban / rural).
Indicator 3.4.1: Mortality rate attributed to cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory disease
Target 3.4: By 2030, reduce by one third premature mortality from non-communicable diseases through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and well-being
Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the per cent of 30-year-old people who would die before their 70th birthday from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, or chronic respiratory diseases, under the assumption that the experienced mortality rate does not change over time, excluding other causes of death such as accidents or HIV/AIDS. This indicator is calculated using the life table method. 
Concepts:
Probability of dying refers to the likelihood that an individual would die between two ages given current mortality rates at each age, calculated using life table methods. The probability of death between two ages may be called a mortality rate. 
Life tables show the mortality experience of a hypothetical group of infants born at the same time and subject throughout their lifetime to a set of age-specific mortality rates. 
Cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory diseases refer to diseases coded as I00-I99, COO-C97, E10-E14 and J30-J98 of the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health problems (ICD-10). 
Rationale and Interpretation:
Disease burden from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) among adults is rapidly increasing in developing countries due to ageing. Cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases are the four main causes of NCD burden. Measuring the risk of dying from these four major causes is important to assess the extent of burden from premature mortality due NCDs in a population.
Data Sources and Collection Method
The preferred data source is death registration systems with complete coverage and medical certification of cause of death. Where such death registration systems do not exist, data can be collected through household surveys and sample registration systems with verbal autopsy. For further information, please refer to WHO (2010).
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method: 
This indicator is calculated based on the life tables influenced by only the four NCDs and applying the the cause-specific death rate to each 5-year age range. (If the cause-specific death rate cannot be disaggregated by 5-year age range, it can be constant.) The  mortality rate for each 5-year age group is calculated as follows:
￼
Mortality rates must be calculated for each five-year age group between ages 30 and 70. Then translate the mortality rate into probability of dying between exact age  and exact age , ￼ :
￼
Finally, the probability of death between the ages of 30 to 70, independent of other causes of death can be calculated as:
￼
Comments and limitations:
Data on deaths are available from countries from death registration data or sample registration systems that record information on cause of death, but less than one half of WHO member states have well-functioning death-registration systems that record causes of death. Data gaps and limitations in some regions reinforce the need for caution when interpreting global comparative cause of death assessments, as well as the need for increased investment in population health measurement systems.
The use of verbal autopsy methods in sample registration systems, demographic surveillance systems and household surveys provides some information on causes of death in countries without well-established death registration systems, but there remain considerable challenges in the validation and interpretation of such data, and in the assessment of uncertainty associated with diagnoses of underlying cause of death.

Indicator 3.4.2: Suicide Mortality Rate
Target 3.4: By 2030, reduce by one third premature mortality from non-communicable diseases through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and well-being
Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the number of suicide deaths in a given year divided by the population, expressed per 100,000 persons. 
Concepts:
Suicide is the act of causing one’s own death. Codes X-60-84 and Y87.0 of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) are considered as suicide deaths for this indicator. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
Mental disorders occur in all regions and cultures of the world. The most prevalent of these disorders are depression and anxiety, which are estimated to affect nearly 1 in 10 people. At its worst, depression and other mental illnesses such as bipolar disorder or schizophrenia can lead to suicide.  In 2016, there were close to 800,000 estimated suicide deaths worldwide. 
Data Sources and Collection Method
The preferred data source is death registration systems with complete coverage and medical certification of cause of death. Where such death registration systems do not exist, data can be collected through household surveys with verbal autopsy, sample registration or sentinel registration systems. In some cases, special studies and surveillance systems can also provide usable data. 
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
Suicide mortality rate can be calculated using the formula below: 
￼
Comments and limitations:
Data on deaths are available from countries from death registration data or sample registration systems that record information on cause of death, but less than one half of WHO Member States have well-functioning death-registration systems that record causes of death. Even where such systems exist, recording of suicide may be prevented by:
	•	Poor linkages with coronial and police systems. In the absence of such linkages, the proportion of suicides which are classified as injuries of undetermined intent, unintentional injury or unknown cause may be very high, and the suicide rate is underestimated.
	•	Stigma. Due to stigma, suicides may be recorded as unintentional injury deaths, underestimating the suicide rate.
	•	Legal or financial considerations.  For example, life insurance policies may preclude payment when deaths are due to suicide, leading to underrecording of suicide deaths. In some countries suicide is considered a criminal act.

Indicator 3.5.2: Harmful use of alcohol, defined according to the national context as alcohol per capita (aged 15 years and older) consumption within a calendar year in litres of pure alcohol
Target 3.5: Strengthen the prevention and treatment of substance abuse, including narcotic drug abuse and harmful use of alcohol
Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
Total alcohol per capita consumption (APC) is defined as the total (sum of recorded and unrecorded alcohol) amount of alcohol consumed per person (15 years of age and older) over a calendar year, in litres of pure alcohol, adjusted for tourist consumption. The estimates for the total alcohol consumption are produced by summing up the 3-year average per capita (15 years of age and older) recorded alcohol consumption and an estimate of per capita (15+) unrecorded alcohol consumption for a calendar year. 
Concepts: 
Recorded alcohol consumption refers to alcohol consumed according to the official statistics at country level based on production, import, export, and sales or taxation data. 
Unrecorded alcohol consumption refers to alcohol which is not taxed and is outside the usual system of governmental control, such as home or informally produced alcohol (legal or illegal), smuggled alcohol, surrogate alcohol (which is alcohol not intended for human consumption), or alcohol obtained through cross-border shopping (which is recorded in a different jurisdiction). 
Tourist consumption takes into account tourists visiting the country and inhabitants visiting other countries. Positive figures denote alcohol consumption of outbound tourists being greater than alcohol consumption by inbound tourists, negative numbers the opposite. Tourist consumption is based on UN statistics, and data are provided by IHME. 
Pure alcohol volume is derived using the following conversions of alcohol content (% alcohol by volume): Beer (barley beer 5%), Wine (grape wine 12%; must of grape 9%, vermouth 16%), Spirits (distilled spirits 40%; spirit-like 30%), and Other (sorghum, millet, maize beers 5%; cider 5%; fortified wine 17% and 18%; fermented wheat and fermented rice 9%; other fermented beverages 9%). 
Rationale and Interpretation:
Alcohol consumption can have an impact not only on the incidence of diseases, injuries and other health conditions, but also on the course of disorders and their outcomes in individuals. Alcohol consumption has been identified as a component cause for more than 200 diseases, injuries and other health conditions. Per capita alcohol consumption is widely accepted as the best possible indicator of alcohol exposure in populations and of effectiveness of population-based prevention efforts to reduce the harmful use of alcohol. It is also the key indicator for estimation of alcohol-attributable disease burden and alcohol-attributable deaths. Its correct interpretation, however, requires the use of additional population-based indicators such as prevalence of drinking and heavy episodic drinking, and, as a result, stimulates development of national monitoring systems on alcohol and health involving strengthening of national data on sales of alcoholic beverages and production and trade with contributions from a wide range of stakeholders as well as conducting representative population-based surveys to generate data on patterns of alcohol consumption.
Data Sources and Collection Method
For recorded alcohol consumption, government statistics are the preferred data source. In cases where government data on production, import, export, sales or taxation are inadequate, alcohol industry statistics are used. In the absence of such data, FAOSTAT is used as a source of data. In order to improve the quality of data, countries need to develop/strengthen registration, monitoring and surveillance systems of sales and taxation data or on production, import and export of alcoholic beverages or, e.g. through their national statistics offices or tax administration departments. 
For unrecorded alcohol consumption, nationally representative survey data, specific empirical investigations, and expert opinions can provide the necessary data for producing the estimates. In order to improve the data, countries need to conduct specific empirical investigations or include questions on unrecorded consumption in their nationally representative surveys, in the same way as it is included e.g. in the WHO STEPS survey instrument. 
For tourist consumption, the litres of alcohol consumed by tourists in a country are based on the number of tourists who visited a country, the average amount of time they spent in the country, and how much these people drink on average in their countries of origin (estimated based on per capita consumption of recorded and unrecorded alcohol). Furthermore, tourist alcohol consumption also accounts for the inhabitants of a country consuming alcohol while visiting other countries (based on the average time spent outside of their country (for all people 15 years and older) and the amount of alcohol consumed in their country of origin). These estimations assume (1) that people drink the same amounts of alcohol when they are tourists as they do in their home countries, and (2) that global tourist consumption is equal to 0 (and thus tourist consumption can be either net negative or positive). In order to improve the data, countries need to record tourist flows to and from the country including the length of stay.
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method: 
The following formula is used for the calculation of this indicator:
￼
Retail sales data or associated taxation data offer the most accurate estimation of recorded alcohol consumption in a defined population during a calendar year. When such data is not available, recorded alcohol consumption is estimated from data on the production and trade of alcoholic beverages. National survey data taken in isolation cannot be used for reliable estimation of the overall alcohol consumption in populations. 
The estimates of unrecorded alcohol consumption are usually based on the data generated in population-based surveys, specific empirical investigations or from expert opinions. Alternatively, the estimates can be produced by mathematical modelling using statistical associations of unrecorded alcohol consumption with other population-based indicators. Triangulation of data generated by different methods improve the validity of the estimates. 
Comments and limitations:
The estimation of unrecorded APC remains a challenge, and triangulation of data from different sources as well as Delphi techniques are used for increasing validity of estimates. During the recent years the number of research activities focused on improvement of the estimates of unrecorded alcohol consumption as well as their geographical coverage have increased substantially.

Indicator 3.6.1: Death rate due to road traffic injuries
Target 3.6: By 2020, halve the number of global deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents 
Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the number of fatalities (deaths) from injuries experienced from road traffic accidents per 100,000 population. 
Concepts: 
Road: Line of communication (travelled way) open to public traffic, primarily for the use of road motor vehicles, using a stabilized base other than rails or air strips. Included are paved roads and other roads with a stabilized base, e.g. gravel roads. Roads also cover streets, bridges, tunnels, supporting structures, junctions, crossings and interchanges.
Road network: All roads in a given area.
Road vehicle: A vehicle running or drawn on wheels intended for use on roads.
Road motor vehicle: A road vehicle fitted with an engine providing its sole means of propulsion, which is normally used for carrying persons or goods, or for drawing (on the road), vehicles used for the carriage of persons or goods.
Road traffic: Any movement of a road vehicle on a given road network.
Road transport: Any movements of goods and/or passengers using a road vehicle on a given road network.
Road traffic crash: A collision or incident involving at least one road vehicle in motion, on a public road or private road to which the public has right of access. Included are: collisions between road vehicles; between road vehicles and pedestrians; between road vehicles and animals or fixed obstacles and with one road vehicle alone. Included are collisions between road and rail vehicles. Multi-vehicle collisions are counted as only one crash provided that any successive collisions happen within a very short time period.
Injury: Physical damage that results when a human body is suddenly or briefly subjected to intolerable levels of energy. It can be a bodily lesion resulting from acute exposure to excessive energy or impairment of function resulting from lack of vital elements.
Road traffic injury (or casualty): A person who has sustained physical damage (i.e. injury) as a result of a road traffic crash.
Road user: a person using any part of the road system as a non-motorized or motorized transport user.
Road traffic fatality: Any person killed immediately or dying within 30 days as a result of an injury crash, excluding suicides. For countries that do not apply the threshold of 30 days, conversion coefficients are estimated so that comparisons on the basis of the 30 day-definition can be made.
Injury crash: Any road traffic crash resulting in at least one injured or killed person.
Fatal crash: Any road traffic crash resulting in a person killed immediately or dying within 30 days as a result of the crash. 
Footnote: The term “accident”, which is widely used, can give the impression, probably unintended, of inevitabil­ity and unpredictability – an event that cannot be managed. The term “crash” is used instead, to denote an event, or series of events, amenable to rational analysis and remedial action. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
Road traffic injuries are currently estimated to be the eighth leading cause of death across all age groups globally, far ahead of whereas HIV/AIDS which is now the 14th leading cause of death with slightly over a million deaths per year.  They are the leading cause of death for young people aged 15–29 years, and as a result take a heavy toll on those entering their most productive years.
Road traffic injuries are increasing, notably in low- and middle-income countries, where rates are twice those in high-income countries. This is partly attributable to the rapid rate of motorization in many developing countries that has occurred without a concomitant investment in road safety strategies and land use planning. While road traffic fatality rates are decreasing in some high-income countries, the rapid increase in road traffic crashes in low- and middle income countries has driven an overall global increase in deaths and injuries. Indeed, current trends suggest that road traffic injuries will become the seventh leading cause of death by 2030, with the disparity between high- and low-income countries further accentuated.
Every year the lives of more than 1.4 million people are cut short because of a road traffic crash. In addition to death, between 20 and 50 million more people suffer non-fatal injuries, with many incurring a disability due to their injury. 
Road traffic injuries cause considerable economic losses to individuals, their families, and to nations. These losses arise from the cost of treatment as well as lost productivity for those killed or disabled by their injuries, and for family members who need to take time off work or school to care for the injured. Road traffic crashes cost most countries 3% of their gross domestic product.
Data Sources and Collection Method
The main sources of the data on fatal road traffic injuries are:
	•	Police records
	•	Health facility records
	•	Death certificates / vital registration
	•	Insurance records
	•	Media reports 
It is important for a country to develop and ensure that a reliable surveillance system is in place for collection, analysis and dissemination of road traffic injury data. The system should collect data on a minimum set of variables that is useful for national analysis.

Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
The following formula is used to calculate this indicator:
 ￼
For cases where underlying data is incomplete or unavailable, international organizations like the WHO model this indicator’s value using various estimation methods. The method used depends on the level of coverage of death registration data and the population of the country. For further information on the methods, see page 70 of http://who.int/violence_injury_prevention/road_safety_status/2015/en/ 
Comments and limitations:
Results can vary based on differences in the data used for population and whether it comes from national data or the estimates produced by the UN department of population. 
Many countries do not have vital registration data, in which cases surveys are used for estimations. Therefore, attention needs to be paid when comparing across countries.

Data Disaggregation
This indicator does not reveal much when it is an aggregate figure. It is therefore important to disaggregate it along dimensions that can be interpreted easily and used to raise awareness and advocate for action. The key dimensions for disaggregation are road users, age, sex and income groups of countries. For example, disaggregation by road users reveals how road traffic death varies by different road users in different regions such as pedestrians, cyclists, 2-or 3-wheelers, bus passengers and drivers. Disaggregating by age will show which age groups are more or less affected by road traffic deaths. Examining variation by sex indicates impact of road traffic deaths among males and females. For example, deaths among males is three times higher than among the females. Looked at along income groups of countries will reveal how low-, middle- and high-income countries are affected by road traffic death.  Ninety percent of road traffic deaths occur in low- and middle -income countries, and while these countries also account for 82% of the world’s population.
Indicator 3.7.1: Proportion of women of reproductive age (aged 15-49 years) who have their need for family planning satisfied with modern methods
Target 3.7: By 2030, ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services, including for family planning, information and education, and the integration of reproductive health into national strategies and programmes 
Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the percentage of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) who desire either to have no (additional) children or to postpone the next child and who are currently using a modern contraceptive method. 
Concepts: 
The percentage of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) who have their need for family planning satisfied with modern methods is also referred to as the proportion of demand for family planning satisfied by modern methods. The components of the indicator are contraceptive prevalence (any method and modern methods) and unmet need for family planning. 
Contraceptive prevalence is the percentage of women who are currently using, or whose sexual partner is currently using, at least one method of contraception, regardless of the method used. Unmet need for family planning is defined as the percentage of women of reproductive age, either married or in a union, who want to stop or delay childbearing but are not using any method of contraception. 
Modern contraceptive methods include sterilization, the intra-uterine device (IUD), the implant, injectables, oral contraceptive pills, condoms, vaginal barrier methods (including the diaphragm, cervical cap and spermicidal foam, jelly, cream and sponge), lactational amenorrhea method (LAM), emergency contraception and other modern methods not reported separately (e.g., the contraceptive patch or vaginal ring). traditional contraceptive methods include rhythm (e.g., fertility awareness-based methods, periodic abstinence), withdrawal and other traditional methods not reported separately. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
The proportion of demand for family planning satisfied with modern methods is useful in assessing overall levels of coverage for family planning programmes and services. Access to and use of an effective means to prevent pregnancy helps enable women and their partners to exercise their rights to decide freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children and to have the information, education and means to do so. 
Meeting demand for family planning with modern methods also contributes to maternal and child health by preventing unintended pregnancies and closely spaced pregnancies, which are at higher risk for poor obstetrical outcomes. Levels of demand for family planning satisfied with modern methods of 75 per cent or more are generally considered high, and values of 50 per cent or less are generally considered as very low.
Data Sources and Collection Method
The data used to calculate this indicator comes from nationally-representative household survey data. Multi-country survey programmes that include relevant data for this indicator are: Contraceptive Prevalence Surveys (CPS), Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), Fertility and Family Surveys (FFS), Reproductive Health Surveys (RHS), Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), Performance Monitoring and Accountability 2020 surveys (PMA), World Fertility Surveys (WFS), other international survey programmes and national surveys.
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method: 
The numerator is the percentage of women of reproductive age (15-49 years old) who are currently using, or whose sexual partner is currently using, at least one modern contraceptive method. The denominator is the total demand for family planning (the sum of contraceptive prevalence (any method) and the unmet need for family planning). Estimates are with respect to women who are married or in a union. 
The following general formula can be used to calculate the proportion of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) who have their need for family planning satisfied with modern methods (W): 
￼
Comments and limitations:
Differences in the survey design and implementation, as well as differences in the way survey questionnaires are formulated and administered can affect the comparability of the data. The most common differences relate to the range of contraceptive methods included and the characteristics (age, sex, marital or union status) of the persons for whom contraceptive prevalence is estimated (base population) and in the calculation of unmet need for family planning. 
The time frame used to assess contraceptive prevalence can also vary. In most surveys there is no definition of what is meant by “currently using” a method of contraception. In some surveys, the lack of probing questions, asked to ensure that the respondent understands the meaning of the different contraceptive methods, can result in an underestimation of contraceptive prevalence, in particular for traditional methods. 
Sampling variability can also be an issue, especially when contraceptive prevalence is measured for a specific subgroup (according to method, age-group, level of educational attainment, place of residence, etc.) or when analysing trends over time.

Data Disaggregation

Indicator 3.7.2: Adolescent birth rate (aged 10-14 years; aged 15-19 years) per 1,000 women in that age group
Target 3.7: By 2030, ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services, including for family planning, information and education, and the integration of reproductive health into national strategies and programmes
Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the annual number of births to females of age groups 10-14 or 15-19 per 1000 females in the respective age group. 
Concepts:
Live birth is defined as to the complete expulsion or extraction from its mother of a product of conception, irrespective of the duration of the pregnancy, which, after such separation, breathes or shows any other evidence of life—e.g. beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord or definite movement of voluntary muscles—whether or not the umbilical cord has been cut or the placenta is attached. Each product of such a birth is considered live born (WHO, 2018).  Total number of live births is then the total number of births excluding stillbirths.  
Rationale and Interpretation:
Reducing adolescent pregnancies and adolescent birth rates is an important priority for many Governments (United Nations, 1994; United Nations, 2013).  Adolescent childbearing is associated with a wide range of risks for young mothers. Women who become pregnant and give birth very early in their lives as well as their newborns are subject to elevated health risks (Nove and others, 2014; WHO, 2014). Particularly in low- and middle-income countries, the risk of deaths of infants born to teenage mothers is about 50 per cent higher than the risk of death of newborns of mothers aged 20-29 (WHO, 2014).  Adolescent pregnancies are closely linked to unsafe abortions, an often cause for maternal deaths and lingering health problems are often caused by. Young women are particularly vulnerable as they are more likely than older women to undergo late abortions (Lim and others, 2012) and to have repeat abortions (Collier, 2009).  Apart from health risks for mother and child, adolescent pregnancy curtails opportunities for socio-economic development of young girls, forcing young girls to discontinue or interrupt their education, depriving them of advanced education, secure job opportunities, in many cases leading to lower future earnings, perpetuation of poverty cycles, social and political exclusion (United Nations, 2013).  Therefore, preventing births very early in a woman’s life is an important measure to provide young woman with adequate education and life-long opportunities, improve maternal health, and reduce infant mortality.
Data Sources and Collection Method
The best estimates of fertility and adolescent birth rates in particular are obtained from a universal and well-functioning civil registration and vital statistics system (United Nations, 2014). In such a system, all births are registered shortly after occurrence and a birth certificate is issued for every child born. The information from the birth certificates is then used for the production of vital statistics. The population exposures needed for computations of fertility rates are based on annual population estimates, which are derived from the population by age and sex enumerated in population censuses, births, deaths, and migration for intercensal or postcensal periods. In countries with operating population registers population censuses are not regularly conducted, since statistics in such countries are based on the continuous collection of information on both population and vital events. In these countries, annual population estimates are based on the data recorded in the population registers. 
The quality of the estimates depends on the accuracy of the information collected on births and on the accuracy of population estimates. One of the main sources of error is the incomplete coverage of birth registration or population statistics.  Population registers tend to produce population data of better quality and accuracy than population censuses. Nevertheless, population estimates based on registers might still be affected by inaccurate and incomplete data on international migration.  When vital registration systems fail to record all births that take place during a given period of time or population censuses fail to enumerate every individual, their coverage is said to be incomplete. Using incomplete data to produce fertility estimates requires adjustments to births and population estimates. In the case of population censuses, adjusted population estimates are usually produced by conducting a post enumeration survey.  Also, the coverage and completeness of civil registration is often assessed by a dual registration approach or by using alternative sources of information on vital events.  More detailed accounts of methods for assessing the quality of population and vital statistics are given in Preston and others (2001), Bogue and others (1993), Shryock, Siegel, and Associates (1980). Moriyama (1990) describes an array of methods historically used to evaluate the quality of population and vital statistics in the United States. 
In countries with incomplete vital registration, the main sources of information on fertility levels and trends are population censuses and nationally-representative household surveys. 
The infrequency with which censuses are conducted (typically every 10 years) is one of their main limitations—it is often inadequate for the management and monitoring of population and development programmes.  A more flexible and by far less expensive mechanism for collecting fertility data are sample household surveys. Due to their smaller sample sizes, data on fertility can be collected more frequently and questions can be more detailed and targeted than in population censuses. Full birth histories have become the dominant source for producing estimates of fertility levels and trends for countries without well-functioning civil registration and vital statistics systems.  A birth history records every live-born child a woman has had, the child’s sex, date of birth and, if the child died, the date of death.  The full birth histories have been routinely collected starting with the World Fertility Survey in the late 1970s.  Direct computation of fertility rates from birth histories is well documented in Croft (1991) and Rutstein and Rojas (2006). 
Some examples of relevant, internationally coordinated surveys are the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), the Reproductive Health Surveys (RHS), and the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS). Examples of national surveys are the European Fertility and Family Surveys (FFS) or the Pan-Arab Project for Family Health (PAPFAM).
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
Monitoring this indicator requires tracking of two rates: (1) age-specific fertility rate for mothers aged 10-14 and (2) age-specific fertility rate for mothers aged 15-19.  An age-specific fertility rate is defined as ratio of annual numbers of live births of mothers of a certain age interval to person-years lived (or population exposures) by women in that age interval (Preston and others, 2001).  The age-specific fertility rate for mothers aged 10-14 is defined then as
 ￼
Similarly, the age-specific fertility rate for mothers aged 10-15 is defined then as 
￼ Both rates could be computed for single calendar years and for longer periods. 
Comments and limitations:
Discrepancies between the sources of data at the country level are common and the level of the adolescent birth rate depends in part on the source of the data selected. For civil registration, rates are subject to limitations which depend on the completeness of birth registration, the treatment of infants born alive but die before registration or within the first 24 hours of life, the quality of the reported information relating to age of the mother, and the inclusion of births from previous periods. The population estimates may suffer from limitations connected to age misreporting and coverage. 
For survey and census data, both the numerator and denominator come from the same population. The main limitations concern age misreporting, birth omissions, misreporting the date of birth of the child, and sampling variability in the case of surveys. With respect to estimates of the adolescent birth rate among females aged 10-14 years, comparative evidence suggests that a very small proportion of births in this age group occur to females below age 12. Other evidence based on retrospective birth history data from surveys indicates that women aged 15-19 years are less likely to first births before age 15 than women from the same birth cohort when asked five years later at ages 20–24 years. 
The adolescent birth rate is commonly reported as the age-specific fertility rate for ages 15-19 years in the context of calculation of total fertility estimates. It has also been called adolescent fertility rate. A related measure is the proportion of adolescent fertility measured as the percentage of total fertility contributed by women aged 15-19. 
Empirical evidence on adolescent fertility for the 10-14 year age group is often lacking ast he rates are not reoutinely published as for the 15-19 year group due to much smaller rates, limited data collection, and dubious quality due to omission and competence issues. Even if the data are collected, they often require special access and data processing. By and large, the most of empirical evidence on adolescent births is available for the age group 15-19.

Data Disaggregation
The disaggregation of adolescent birth rates by geographical area, rural or urban residence, women’s level of education, poverty status and other characteristics that are relevant in the national context help identify population sub-groups where levels of adolescent birth rates are highest and formulate policies for the reduction of adolescent birth rates and the improvement of reproductive health of adolescent girls. 
The indicator would benefit from disaggregation by single year because fertility rates vary significantly within and across the 10-14 and 15-19 5-year age groups.  Evidence suggests that a very small proportion of births in this age group occur to females below age 12, and that the risk of childbearing in these two age-groups sharply increases with age. Age patterns vary across countries and over time, but in general, the single-age disaggregation permits for a finer assessment of the risks, and the identification of the populations served by the relevant programs.
The recommended dimensions of disaggregation for this indicator includes age (by single years of age, whenever possible), education, marital status (married/in union; never married; ever married; all women), socioeconomic status (country-specific categories), geographical location and other relevant categories, as allowed by the corresponding data source and the number of observations underlying each unit of disaggregation. 
Specific limitations for data disaggregation by specific to indicator 3.7.2 include:
	1.	Age: fertility data in surveys and vital registration are often not collected or reported for individuals under the age of 15 years, for cultural, legal and other reasons;
	2.	Marital status: fertility data often collected only for married/in union women (for cultural and legal reasons)
	3.	Sample size of household surveys 
Indicator 3.8.2: Proportion of population with large household expenditures on health as a share of total household expenditure or income
Target 3.8: Achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health-care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all
Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the proportion of population that spends a large portion of the total household income or expenditure on health-related expenditures. Two thresholds are used to define “large household expenditures on health” – (1) greater than 10%; and (2) greater than 25% of total household expenditure or income. 
Concepts:
Health-related expenditure is defined as any expenditure incurred at the time of service use to get any type of care (promotive, preventive, curative, rehabilitative, palliative or long-term care) including all medicines, vaccines and other pharmaceutical preparations as well as all health products, from any type of provider and for all members of the household. These health expenditures are characterized by a direct payment that are financed by a household’s income (including remittances), savings or loans but do not include any third-party payer reimbursement. Direct health care payments are labelled Out-Of-Pocket (OOP) payments in the classification of health care financing schemes (HF) of the international Classification for Health Accounts (ICHA). OOP health expenditures are the most unequitable source of funding for the health system because directly related to the underlying severity of the health condition (the sicker spend more), based solely on the ability to pay of the household (no pooling is possible), lead to service delivery only if the individual pays. 
The components of a household’s health care consumption expenditure so defined should be consistent with division 06 of the UN Classification of Individual Consumption According to Purpose (COICOP 2018) and include expenditures on medicines and medical products (06.1), outpatient care services (06.2), inpatient care services (06.3) and other health services (06.4). 
Expenditure on household consumption is a monetary welfare measure. It is generally defined as the sum of the monetary values of all items (goods and services) consumed by the household during a reference period. It includes the imputed values of goods and services that are not purchased but procured otherwise for consumption.
Household income is also a monetary welfare measure. The most relevant measure of income is disposable income as it is close to the maximum available to the household for consumption expenditure during the accounting period. Disposable income is defined as total income less direct taxes (net of refunds), compulsory fees and fines. Total income is generally composed of income from employment, property income, income from household production of services for own consumption, transfers received in cash and goods, transfers received as services.
Expenditure on household consumption is the recommended monetary welfare measure.
Rationale and Interpretation:
The target of this indicator calls for granting access to healthcare based on health needs and not the household’s capacity to pull together all its financial resources to meet the health needs of its members. Therefore, this indicator attempts to identify those people who need to devote a substantial share of their total household expenditure or income (budget) to health care. Some direct payments might be needed to access healthcare but no one, at whatever income level, should have to choose between spending on health and spending on other basic goods and services such as education tuitions, food necessities, housing and utilities. This is then a way to assess the extent to which health systems lead to financial hardship. 
Data Sources and Collection Method
The recommended data sources for the monitoring of this indicator are household surveys with information on both household consumption expenditure on health and total household consumption expenditures, which are routinely conducted by national statistical offices (NSOs). Household budget surveys (HBS) and household income and expenditure surveys (HIES) typically collect these as they are primarily conducted to provide inputs to the calculation of consumer price indices or the compilation of national accounts. 
Another potential source of information is socio-economic or living standards surveys; however, some of these surveys may not collect information on total household consumption expenditures – for example, when a country measures poverty using income as the welfare measure. The most important criterion for selecting a data source to measure this indicator is the availability of both household consumption expenditure on health and total household consumption expenditures. 
Income is more difficult to measure accurately due to its greater variability over time. Consumption is less variable over time and easier to measure. It is therefore recommended that whenever there is information on both household consumption and income the former is used.
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
The following formula can be used for calculating the population weighted average number of people with large household expenditure on health as a share of total household expenditure or income:
 ￼
where i denotes a household, 1() is the indicator function that takes on the value 1 if the bracketed expression is true, and 0 otherwise, mi corresponds to the number of household members of i,  corresponds to the sampling weight of household i, ￼is a threshold identifying large household expenditure on health as a share of total household consumption or income (i.e. 10% and 25%). 
Comments and limitations:
This indicator attempts to identify financial hardship that individuals face when using their income, savings or taking loans to pay for health care. However, most household surveys fail to identify the source of funding used by a household who is reporting health expenditure. In countries where there is no retrospective reimbursement of household spending on health this is not a problem. But in those countries where there is retrospective reimbursement – for example, via a contributory health insurance scheme - the amount reported by a household on health expenditures might be totally or partially reimbursed at some later point, perhaps outside the recall period of the household survey. 
This indicator relies on a single cut-off point to identify what constitutes ‘large health expenditure as a share of total household expenditure or income’. People just below or above such thresholds are not taken into account, which is always the problem with measures based on cut-offs. By plotting the cumulative distribution function of the health expenditure ratio, it is possible to identify the proportion of the population that is devoting any share of its household’s budget to health for any threshold. 
Low values of this indicators can be driven by people’s inability to spend anything on heatlh which, at least for the services that are included in 3.8.1, should result in low levels of coverage. This is why both indicators 3.8.1 and 3.8.2 should be monitored jointly. 
This indicator can experience measurement errors due to both sampling and non-sampling errors. The definition of this indicators suggests that the monetary welfare measure can be based on an income approach or a consumption expenditure one. But recent evidence suggests that this choice has implications for the measurement of inequalities. Income-based measures show a greater concentration of the proportion of the population with large household expenditure on health among the more worse-off than expenditure-based measures.

Indicator 3.9.1: Mortality rate attributed to household and ambient air pollution
Target 3.9: By 2030, substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water and soil pollution and contamination
Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the mortality attributable to the joint effects of household and ambient air pollution, and can be expressed as per 100,000 population for any given population group (eg. children under 5 years of age). 
Concepts:
Ambient air pollution refers to outdoor pollution resulting from emissions from industrial activity, households, cars and trucks, etc. 
Household air pollution refers to indoor pollution resulting from the use of polluting cooking fuels such as kerosene, wood, coal animal dung, charcoal and crop wastes 
Ambient and household are often treated separately, although they are strongly interlinked since household air pollution is a large –often underestimated – source of ambient air pollution. They have been dealt with separately by both scientist and policy makers for historical and practical reasons.  Household air pollution also include the use of polluting fuels for lighting and heating purposes. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
The target aims to reduce the number of deaths from hazardous air pollution. This indicator tracks mortality rates attributed to ambient and household air pollution, as air pollution is the biggest environmental risk to health. 
Evidence from epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to air pollution is linked, among others, to the important diseases taken into account in this estimate:
- Acute respiratory infections  (estimated for all ages );
- Cerebrovascular diseases (stroke) in adults (estimated above 25 years);
- Ischaemic heart diseases (IHD) in adults (estimated above 25 years);
- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults (estimated above 25 years); and
- Lung cancer in adults (estimated above 25 years).
In order to achieve a meaningful reduction in deaths associated with air pollution from particulate matter, it is important not only and firstly to reduce air pollution levels, but also to reduce exposure whenever possible (e.g. for household air pollution using clean cooking technologies, avoiding cooking with children around etc.) and to reduce the prevalence of air pollution associated diseases such as those mentioned above. 
Data Sources and Collection Method
- Exposure to ambient air pollution : Countries regularly reporting annual concentration of PM2.5 or PM10 from ground monitoring networks can use these values, provided that they are representative for the level of exposure in the population (e.g. the monitoring station must be located where people spend a meaningful amount of time, for work, leisure or residential). Otherwise, country population exposure to annual mean concentration of particulate matter (PM2.5, of a diameter equal or less than 2.5 micrometre) are derived from methods using both ground measurements and satellite information, as regularly reported for SDG 11.6.2 for urban areas, but are also derived for urban and rural (see http://www.who.int/airpollution/ambient/AAP_exposure_Apr2018_final.pdf?ua=1) and can be used. 
- Exposure to household air pollution :  Countries having conducted specific and proper indoor monitoring of PM2.5 (e.g. India) may use these values. For the others, the proxy indicator of proportion of population in a country relying mainly on polluting fuels and technologies for cooking, as regularly reported in national household surveys or censuses  can be used. This indicator is modelled by WHO and regularly reported as SDG 7.1.2. (see : http://www.who.int/airpollution/data/HAP_exposure_results_final.pdf?ua=1). The source of data for the modelled, reported estimates is country data from national household surveys or censuses.
- Demographic data: Population data used were from the United Nations Population Division, The World Population Prospects – the 2017 revision, New York 2017 (5). Country may have their own population estimates.
- Health data : The total number of deaths and DALYs (disability-adjusted life years) for each country, by sex and age group for acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI), chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), lung cancer, ischaemic heart diseases (IHD), and stroke have been compiled by the World Health Organization (10). Country may have their own health estimates.
- Exposure-risk relationships: To estimate the relative risk for a disease caused by air pollution exposure from PM2.5, an integrated exposure response function (IER) is used. The IER was originally developed for the Global Burden of Disease Study (Lim et al, 2010; Burnett et al, 2014) and has also been used by WHO (12,13). The IER combines the epidemiological evidence for outdoor air pollution, second-hand smoke, household air pollution and active smoking to estimate the level of disease risk (e.g. stroke) at different levels of PM2.5 concentrations (aka dose). In other words, the same mathematical relationship or measure is used to estimate the risk of heart disease from particulate matter originating from outdoor air pollution as that of second-hand smoke or household air pollution. An updated version of the IER functions is used for ALRI, COPD,  lung cancer, IHD and stroke, as in Cohen et al (4) and GBD 2016 (14). However, relative risks derived from national (e.g. France, China) or regional studies (HRAPIE project for Europe) can be used if available. 
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
Mortality rates attributable to air pollution from particulate matter can be obtained through the comparative risk assessment methodology (Ezzati et al, 2002). It consists of assessing a population attributable fraction (PAF) for each disease associated with air pollution. This fraction is derived from the distribution of the exposure in the population, and applied (e.g. multiplied) to the background disease rate of the disease[1]:
Attributable burden = PAF x background disease (expressed in number, rate of deaths, DALYs, etc) 
The PAFs for ambient and household air pollution are first calculated separately. They are then combined in a way that take into account the overlap, i.e. the fact that household air pollution contributes to ambient air pollution (Ezzatti et al, 2003, Lim et al, 2010). 
The mortality attributable to the joint effects of household and ambient air pollution (MAP), expressed per 100,000 people, can be calculated using the formula:
￼ 
The numerator can be estimated using an approach that involves the following steps:
(1) Measuring how widespread the exposure is in the population
(2) Measuring the increased (or relative) risk of a disease resulting from the exposure
(3) Applying the fraction obtained by (1) and (2) to the total burden of disease 
More information can be found at : http://www.who.int/airpollution/data/en/  
Comments and limitations:
- Ambient air pollution levels of particulate matter derived from ground monitoring networks can be used as exposure metrics, provided that they are representative for the level of exposure in the population (e.g. the monitoring station must be located where people spend a meaningful amount of time, for work, leisure or residential).
- The proportion of households in a country relying mainly on polluting fuels and technologies for cooking is currently used as  a proxy indicator to derived exposure to household air pollution. Households mainly cooking with coal, wood, charcoal, dung, crop residues or kerosene are considered exposed.  There are however more and more data available on indoor (e.g. kitchen) PM2.5 measurements due to cooking with polluting fuels. Currently there is a very little to no nationally representative data capturing the type of  solid fuel cookstoves. However recognizing the importance of how the fuel and technology impact the level of household air pollution, estimate exposure and disease burden attributed to both the fuel and solid fuel stove in combination (pending data availability) will be considered in the future. The same apply for the use of polluting fuel and technologies for heating and lighting 
An approximation of the combined effects of risk factors is possible if independence and little correlation between risk factors with impacts on the same diseases can be assumed (Ezzati et al 2003). In the case of air pollution, however, there are some limitations to estimate the joint effects: limited knowledge on the distribution of the population exposed to both household and ambient air pollution, correlation of exposures at individual level as household air pollution is a contributor to ambient air pollution, and non-linear interactions (Lim et al. 2012, Smith et al. 2014). In several regions, however, household air pollution remains mainly a rural issue, while ambient air pollution is predominantly an urban problem. Also, in some continents, many countries are relatively unaffected by household air pollution, while ambient air pollution is a major concern. If assuming independence and little correlation, a rough estimate of the total impact can be calculated, which is less than the sum of the impact of the two risk factors.

Indicator 3.9.2: Mortality rate attributed to unsafe water, unsafe sanitation and lack of hygiene (exposure to unsafe Water, Sanitation and Hygiene for All (WASH) services)
Target 3.9: By 2030, substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water and soil pollution and contamination
Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the number of deaths from unsafe water, unsafe sanitation and lack of hygiene (exposure to unsafe WASH services) in a year per 100,000 population. 
Concepts:
Deaths attributable to unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) are counted using the WASH attributable fractions of diarrhoea (ICD-10 code A00, A01, A03, A04, A06-A09), intestinal nematode infections (ICD-10 code B76- B77, B79) and protein-energy malnutrition (ICD-10 code E40-E46). 
Rationale and Interpretation:
The number of deaths from unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene can be prevented by improving those services and practices. Therefore, measuring the number of deaths that can be attributed to unsafe WASH supports progress towards such prevention.
Data Sources and Collection Method
Data of the proportion of the population using safely managed drinking water services, safely managed sanitation services and having a handwashing facility with soap and water at home is compiled on an annual basis from country-representative household surveys (such as MICS and DHS) through the JMP and can be accessed from their website: https://washdata.org/ 
Increased risk of exposure to unsafe WASH is estimated from a) systematically reviewing the scientific evidence of health effects from unsafe WASH, and b) statistical techniques, such as meta-analysis, to derive a combined or pooled estimate of the associated health effect. These estimates are also updated regularly and the latest updates can be found here: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/tmi.13051 
Most recent disease-specific national mortality figures can be downloaded from the website of the WHO Global Health Observatory’s (GHO) website: http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/estimates/en/
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
The mortality from unsafe water, unsafe sanitation and lack of hygiene, , can be calculated by the formula:
      ￼
The numerator could be estimated using an approach that calculates the population attributable fraction (PAF), which is the proportional reduction of deaths or disease that would occur if exposure to a risk was removed or reduced to an alternative exposure distribution. The calculation of the PAF involves the following steps:
(1) Measuring how widespread the exposure is in the population (Pi)
(2) Measuring the increased (or relative) risk of a disease resulting from the exposure (RRi)
(3) Applying the fraction obtained by (1) and (2) to the total burden of disease
For the simplest case when the exposure is categorical (grouped) and exposure is completely removed or compared with an unexposed population, the PAF can be calculated as:                                                                                                                                                                     
￼
The PAF is then multiplied with the total disease burden (here mortality) to calculate the attributable mortality (such as the “Number of deaths from unsafe WASH” used in formula (I)).
For different situations, i.e. the exposure is continuous or it is not completely removed, formula (II) needs to be adapted. This can be found in the following report on page 120 (Annex 3): http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/204585/9789241565196_eng.pdf?sequence=1
Further detailed description of the statistical techniques and models that could be used for estimating the numerator can be found at: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4156511/
Comments and limitations:
The main limitation is that not all countries have death registration systems, and survey registration data need to be completed with other types of information. Also, both exposure assessment and estimation of the increased (relative) risk from the specific exposure involves different degrees of uncertainties which leads to uncertainties in the resulting PAFs.
Proxy, alternative and additional indicators:
Exposure to unsafe WASH and the increased (or relative) risk from this exposure can be estimated by using three proxy indicators:
	1.	the proportion of the population using safely managed drinking water services
	2.	the proportion of the population using safely managed sanitation services
	3.	the proportion of the population with handwashing facilities with soap and water at home.
Safely managed drinking water services are defined as drinking water from an improved water source which is located on premises, available when needed and free from faecal and priority chemical contamination. Safely managed sanitation services are defined as use of improved facilities which are not shared with other households and where excreta are safely disposed in situ or transported and treated off-site. For a list of improved water and sanitation services and more detailed information please refer to the website of the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP): https://washdata.org/
Data Disaggregation

Indicator 3.9.3: Mortality rate attributed to unintentional poisoning
Target 3.9: By 2030, substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water and soil pollution and contamination
Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the number of deaths from unintentional poisonings in a year per 100,000 population. 
Concepts:
Unintentional poisonings refer to International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) codes X40, X43-X44, and X46-X49, classified as “accidental poisoning by exposure to noxious substances.” 
Rationale and Interpretation:
Measuring how the mortality rate from unintentional poisonings provides an indication of the extent of inadequate management of hazardous chemicals and pollution, and of the effectiveness of a country’s health system.
Data Sources and Collection Method
The data for this indicator comes from civil registration systems that record vital events such as births, deaths, and marriages. Civil registration records are the best source of vital statistics because they generate data on a continuous basis and for the whole country, at both national and local levels. However, such systems are often weak or incomplete in developing countries. In countries where the civil registration system lacks complete coverage, or has major deficiencies due to issues of quality and timeliness, it may be necessary, on an interim basis, to use alternative sources to generate vital statistics. Sources for such interim data include “population censuses”, “household sample surveys”, “demographic surveillance” in sentinel sites and sample registration systems. Although these sources can and do generate measures of vital events, they cannot replace civil registration, which is the only method that collects such information on a continuous basis, and the only source that can provide individuals with a legal document of a vital event. 
For more details, please see:  Improving the quality of use of birth, death and cause-of-death information available at: http://www.who.int/healthinfo/tool_cod_2010.pdf?ua=1
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method: 
Unintentional poisoning mortality rate can be calculated using the formula below: 
￼
Comments and limitations:
Data on deaths are available from countries from death registration data or sample registration systems that record information on cause of death, but less than one half of WHO member states have well-functioning death-registration systems that record causes of death. In countries that have such systems, drug and alcohol overdoses are frequently certified to ICD-10 code X49 (“other and unspecified chemicals and noxious substances”), which leads to an overestimate of the mortality rate from unintentional poisoning deaths from hazardous chemicals and pollution.

Indicator 3.b.2: Total net official development assistance to the medical research and basic health sectors 
Target 3.b: Support the research and development of vaccines and medicines for the communicable and non-communicable diseases that primarily affect developing countries, provide access to affordable essential medicines and vaccines, in accordance with the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health, which affirms the right of developing countries to use to the full the provisions in the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights regarding flexibilities to protect public health, and, in particular, provide access to medicines for all
Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the total amount of gross disbursements of official development assistance (ODA) from all donors to medical research and basic health sectors. 
Concepts:
ODA is defined as those flows to countries and territories on the Development Assistance Committee’s (DAC) list of ODA recipients and to multilateral institutions which are
(1)    Provided by official agencies, including state and local governments, or by the executive agencies; and
(2)    Each transaction:
	1.	is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; and
	2.	is concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25% (calculated at a rate of discount of 10%). 
ODA for Medical research and basic health sectors i is calculated as the sum of all activities in the OECD’s Creditor Reporting System (CRS) using codes in the 122 series (basic health) and CRS code 12182 (medical research). 
Rationale and Interpretation:
Monitoring the total ODA flows to developing countries helps quantify the public effort that donors provide to developing countries for medical research and basic health. 
Data Sources and Collection Method
The data are reported by donors according to the methodology outlined by OECD’s development finance standards. 
A statistical reporter is responsible for the collection of DAC statistics in each providing country/agency. This reporter is usually located in the national aid agency, Ministry of Foreign Affairs or Finance etc
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
This indicator is calculated as the sum of all ODA flows from all donors to developing countries in the CRS for medical research and basic health, as reported by the donor countries. 
Comments and limitations:
Data in the Creditor Reporting System are available from 1973. However, the data coverage is considered complete from 1995 for commitments at an activity level and 2002 for disbursements. 
Proxy, alternative and additional indicators: N/A
Data Disaggregation
The data are available at an activity level and can therefore be disaggregated by donor, recipient, type of flow, type of aid, sector etc.  The sector level data can also be broken down into more granular levels (see http://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/purposecodessectorclassification.htm)
Indicator 3.c.1: Health worker density and distribution 
Target 3.c: Substantially increase health financing and the recruitment, development, training and retention of the health workforce in developing countries, especially in least developed countries and small island developing States
Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator consists of 4 sub-indicators. 
Density of physicians: The density of physicians is defined as the number of physicians, including generalists and specialist medical practitioners per 1,000 population in the given national and/or subnational area.
Density of nursing and midwifery personnel: The density of nursing and midwifery personnel is defined as the number of nursing and midwifery personnel per 1,000 population in the given national and/or subnational area.
Density of dentistry personnel: The density of dentistry personnel is defined as the number of dentists, dental technician/assistants and related occupation personnel per 1,000 population in the given national and/or subnational area.
Density of pharmaceutical personnel: The density of pharmaceutical personnel is defined as the number of pharmacists, pharmaceutical, technicians/assistants and related occupation personnel per 1,000 population in the given national and/or subnational area.
Concepts:
Physicians is the occupation classified in the ISCO-08 codes 221,2211 and 2212. 
Nursing and midwifery personnel is the occupation classified in the ISCO-08 codes 2221, 2222, 3221 and 3222. 
Dentistry personnel is the occupation classified in the ISCO-08 codes 2261, 3214 (excluding medical prosthetic related technicians) and 3251. 
Pharmaceutical personnel is the occupation classified in the ISCO-08 codes 2262 and 3213. 
Active health workers who provide services to patients and communities (practising health worker) or whose medical education is a prerequisite for the execution of the job (e.g. education, research, public administration) even if the health worker is not directly providing services (professionally active health worker). If data are not available for practising or professionally active health workers, data with the closest definition can be used, such as “health worker licensed to practice”. For more information refer to the NHWA Handbook. 
Health occupations should be reported separately. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
Health worker density, with respect to each occupation, provides a view of the level of healthcare workforce available in a given area such that efforts to increase the recruitment, development, training and retention of this workforce can be undertaken in places that need it.
Data Sources and Collection Method
The data is compiled from routine administrative information systems (including reports on staffing and payroll as well as professional training, registration and licensure), population censuses, labour force and employment surveys and health facility assessments. Most of the data from administrative sources are derived from published national health sector reviews and/or official country reports to WHO offices. 
Following the adoption of the Global strategy on human resources for health: workforce 2030 and resolution (WHA 69.19) to address human resources for health (HRH) challenges at the 69th World Health Assembly, May 2016, Member States are called on to consolidate a core set of human resources for health data with annual reporting to the Global Health Observatory, as well as progressive implementation of National Health Workforce Accounts (NHWA), to support national policy and planning and the Global Strategy’s monitoring and accountability framework. Since Its launch in November 2017, Member States are called to use the NHWA data platform to report health workforce data. For additional information, contact hrhstatistics@who.int 
To view latest available data: http://www.who.int/hrh/statistics/nhwa/en/
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
Countries are encouraged to provide the number of active health workers disaggregated by occupation.
Currently, this is being reported separately – density of each health occupations is separately reported.
Health worker density  for the occupation i in the area a can be calculated using the following formula:
For a given health occupation i, in the country
￼
where,
HWi  is the number of health workers of the occupation i; and
POP is the total population of the country. 
Comments and limitations:
Previously, this indicator was estimated using 2 measurements: density of physicians, and density of nursing and midwifery personnel. But in the context of the SDGs, the dataset has been expanded to include physicians, nursing personnel, midwifery personnel, dentistry personnel and pharmaceutical personnel. The dataset is planned to progressively move to cover all health cadres. 
Data on health workers tend to be more complete for the public sector and may underestimate the active workforce in the private, military, nongovernmental organization and faith-based health sectors. 
Depending on the nature of the original data source figures for physicians may include practising physicians only or all registered physicians. Traditional and complementary medicine professionals (ISCO 2230) is not included here. 
The figures for number of nursing and midwifery include nursing personnel and midwifery personnel, whenever available. In many countries, nurses trained with midwifery skills are counted and reported as nurses. This makes the distinction between nursing personnel and midwifery personnel difficult to draw. 
The figures for number of dentistry personnel include dentists, dental technicians/assistants and related occupations. Due to variability of data sources, the professional-level and associate-level occupations may not always be distinguishable. 
The figures for number of pharmaceutical personnel include pharmacists, pharmaceutical technicians/assistants and related occupations. Due to variability of data sources, the professional-level and associate-level occupations may not always be distinguishable. 
Due to the differences in data sources, considerable variability remains across countries in the coverage, periodicity, quality and completeness of the original data.

SDG 3: Health

Ensuring healthy lives and promoting the well-being at all ages is essential to sustainable development.

Significant strides have been made in increasing life expectancy and reducing some of the common killers associated with child and maternal mortality, but working towards achieving the target of less than 70 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births by 2030 would require improvements in skilled delivery care.

Achieving the target of reducing premature deaths due to incommunicable diseases by 1/3 by the year 2030 would also require more efficient technologies for clean fuel use during cooking and education on the risks of tobacco.

Many more efforts are needed to fully eradicate a wide range of diseases and address many different persistent and emerging health issues. By focusing on providing more efficient funding of health systems, improved sanitation and hygiene, increased access to physicians and more tips on ways to reduce ambient pollution, significant progress can be made in helping to save the lives of millions.



Child health

17,000 fewer children die each day than in 1990, but more than five million children still die before their fifth birthday each year.
Since 2000, measles vaccines have averted nearly 15.6 million deaths.
Despite determined global progress, an increasing proportion of child deaths are in Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia. Four out of every five deaths of children under age five occur in these regions.
Children born into poverty are almost twice as likely to die before the age of five as those from wealthier families.
Children of educated motherseven mothers with only primary schoolingare more likely to survive than children of mothers with no education.
Maternal health

Maternal mortality has fallen by 37% since 2000.
In Eastern Asia, Northern Africa and Southern Asia, maternal mortality has declined by around two-thirds.
But maternal mortality ratio  the proportion of mothers that do not survive childbirth compared to those who do  in developing regions is still 14 times higher than in the developed regions.
More women are receiving antenatal care. In developing regions, antenatal care increased from 65 per cent in 1990 to 83 per cent in 2012.
Only half of women in developing regions receive the recommended amount of health care they need.
Fewer teens are having children in most developing regions, but progress has slowed. The large increase in contraceptive use in the 1990s was not matched in the 2000s.
The need for family planning is slowly being met for more women, but demand is increasing at a rapid pace.
HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases

36.9 million people globally were living with HIV in 2017.
21.7 million million people were accessing antiretroviral therapy in 2017.
1.8 million people became newly infected with HIV in 2017.
940 000 people died from AIDS-related illnesses in 2017.
77.3 million people have become infected with HIV since the start of the epidemic.
35.4 million people have died from AIDS-related illnesses since the start of the epidemic.
Tuberculosis remains the leading cause of death among people living with HIV, accounting for around one in three AIDS-related deaths.
Globally, adolescent girls and young women face gender-based inequalities, exclusion, discrimination and violence, which put them at increased risk of acquiring HIV.
HIV is the leading cause of death for women of reproductive age worldwide.
AIDS is now the leading cause of death among adolescents (aged 1019) in Africa and the second most common cause of death among adolescents globally.
Over 6.2 million malaria deaths have been averted between 2000 and 2015, primarily of children under five years of age in sub-Saharan Africa. The global malaria incidence rate has fallen by an estimated 37 per cent and the mortality rates by 58 per cent.
Goal 3 targets

GOOD HEALTH AND WELL-BEING: WHY IT MATTERS

To ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.

Ensuring healthy lives and promoting wellbeing for all at all ages is important to building prosperous societies.
However, despite great strides in improving peoples health and wellbeing in recent years,
inequalities in health care access still persist. More than six million children still die before their fifth birthday each year, and only half of all women in developing regions have access to the health care they need.
Epidemics like HIV/ AIDS thrive where fear and discrimination limit peoples ability to receive the services they need to live healthy and productive lives.

Access to good health and well-being is a human right, and that is why the Sustainable Development Agenda offers a new chance to ensure that everyone can access the highest standards of health and health care not just the wealthiest.

Major progress has been made in several areas, including in child and maternal health as well as in addressing HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases.
Maternal mortality has fallen by almost 50 per cent since 1990; measles vaccines have averted nearly 15.6 million deaths since 2000; and 13.6 million people had access to antiretroviral therapy by the end of 2014..
We may have come a long way, but we still have a longer way to go. Real progress means achieving universal health coverage; making essential medicines and vaccines affordable; ensuring that women have full access to sexual and reproductive health care; and ending all preventable deaths of children.
Ensuring healthy lives for all requires a strong commitment, but the benefits outweigh the cost. Healthy people are the foundation for healthy economies.
For example, if we spent $1 billion in expanding immunization coverage against influenza, pneumonia and other preventable diseases, we could save 1 million childrens lives each year. In the past decade, improvements in health and heath care led to a 24 per cent increase in income growth in some of the poorest countries.
The cost of inaction is greatermillions of children will continue to die from preventable diseases, women will die in pregnancy and childbirth, and health care costs will continue to plunge millions of people into poverty. Noncommunicable diseases alone will cost lowand middle-income countries more than $7 trillion in the next 15 years.
You can start by promoting and protecting your own health and the health of those around you, by making well-informed choices, practicing safe sex and vaccinating your children.
You can raise awareness in your community about the importance of good health, healthy lifestyles as well as peoples right to quality health care services.
Take action through schools, clubs, teams and organizations to promote better health for all, especially for the most vulnerable such as women and children.
You can also hold your government, local leaders and other decisionmakers accountable to their commitments to improve peoples access to health and health care.
                                           
Goal 3. Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages
Goal 3 seeks to ensure health and well-being for all, at every stage of life. The Goal addresses all major health priorities, including reproductive, maternal and child health; communicable, non-communicable and environmental diseases; universal health coverage; and access for all to safe, effective, quality and affordable medicines and vaccines. It also calls for more research and development, increased health financing, and strengthened capacity of all countries in health risk reduction and management.Between 2000 and 2015, the global maternal mortality ratio, or number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, declined by 37 per cent, to an estimated ratio of 216 per 100,000 live births in 2015. Almost all maternal deaths occur in low-resource settings and can be prevented. Globally, 3 out of 4 births were assisted by skilled health-care personnel in 2015. Under-five mortality rates fell rapidly from 2000 to 2015, declining by 44 per cent globally. Nevertheless, an estimated  5.9 million children under the age of 5 died in 2015, with a global under-five mortality rate of 43 per 1,000 live births. The neonatal mortality rate, that is, the likelihood of dying in the first 28 days of life, declined from 31 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2000 to 19 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2015. Over that period, progress in the rate of child survival among children aged 1 to 59 months outpaced advances in reducing neonatal mortality; as a result, neonatal deaths now represent a larger share (45 per cent) of all under-five deaths. Preventing unintended pregnancy and reducing adolescent childbearing through universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services are critical to further advances in the health of women, children and adolescents. Worldwide, in 2015, approximately 3 in 4 women of reproductive age (15 to 49 years of age) who were married or in union satisfied their need for family planning by using modern contraceptive methods; in sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania, however, the share was less than half. Childbearing in adolescence has steadily declined in almost all regions, but wide disparities persist: in 2015, the birth rate among adolescent girls aged 15 to 19 ranged from 7 births per 1,000 girls in Eastern Asia to 102 births per 1,000 girls in sub-Saharan Africa.The incidence of major infectious diseases, including HIV, tuberculosis and malaria, has declined globally since 2000. Globally in 2015, the number of new HIV infections among all people was 0.3 new infections per 1,000 uninfected people;  2.1 million people became newly infected that year. The incidence of HIV was highest in sub-Saharan Africa, with 1.5 new cases per 1,000 uninfected people. In 2014, 9.6 million new cases of tuberculosis (133 cases per 100,000 people) were reported worldwide, with 58 per cent of them in South-Eastern Asia and the Western Pacific. Almost half the worlds population is at risk of malaria and, in 2015, the incidence rate was 91 new cases per 1,000 people at risk, an estimated total of 214 million cases. Sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 89 per cent of all malaria cases worldwide, with an incidence rate of 235 cases per 1,000 people at risk. In 2014, at least 1.7 billion people, in 185 countries, required treatment for at least one neglected tropical disease. According to estimates from 2012, around 38 million deaths per year, accounting for 68 per cent of all deaths worldwide, were attributable to noncommunicable diseases. Of all deaths among persons under the age of 70, commonly referred to as premature deaths, an estimated 52 per cent were as a result of non-communicable diseases. Over three quarters of premature deaths were caused by cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory disease. Globally, premature mortality from those four main categories of noncommunicable disease declined by 15 per cent between 2000 and 2012. Reducing tobacco use will be critical for meeting the proposed target of reducing premature mortality from non-communicable diseases by one third. In 2015, over 1.1 billion people consumed tobacco, with far more male (945 million) than female (180 million) smokers.Unhealthy environmental conditions increase the risk of both noncommunicable and infectious diseases, which is reflected in the strong integrated nature of the Goals. In 2012, an estimated 889,000 people died from infectious diseases caused largely by faecal contamination of water and soil and by inadequate hand-washing facilities and practices resulting from poor or non-existent sanitation services. In 2012, household and ambient air pollution resulted in some 6.5 million deaths.Substance use and substance-use disorders have also created a significant public health burden. Worldwide, average alcohol consumption in 2015 was estimated at 6.3l of pure alcohol per person among those aged 15 or older, with wide variations across countries. Alcohol consumption was highest in the developed regions (10.4l per person) and lowest in Northern Africa (0.5l per person). In 2013, only about 1 in 6 people worldwide suffering from drug-use disorders received treatment. Approximately 1 in 18 people with drug-use disorders received treatment in Africa that year, compared with 1 in 5 in Western and Central Europe.Mental disorders occur in all regions and cultures. The most common are anxiety and depression, which, not infrequently, can lead to suicide. In 2012, an estimated 800,000 people worldwide committed suicide, and 86 per cent of them were under the age of 70. Globally, suicide is the second leading cause of death among those between the ages of 15 and 29. Around 1.25 million people died from road traffic injuries in 2013. Halving the number of global deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents by 2020 is an ambitious goal given the dramatic increase in the number of vehicles, which nearly doubled between 2000 and 2013.Total official flows from all providers for medical research and basic health sectors were $8.9 billion in 2014. Within this total, official development assistance (ODA) from DAC donors was $4.5 billion in 2014, an increase of 20 per cent in real terms since 2010, with the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America accounting for $2.6 billion of that total. In 2014, $1 billion was spent on malaria control and $1.2 billion was spent on other infectious diseases, excluding AIDS.Goal 3. Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at allages
Since 2000, impressive advancements have been made on many health fronts. However, to meet the Sustainable Development Goals health targets by 2030, progress must be accelerated, in particular in regions with the highest burden of disease. 
		Reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health 

		In 2015, the global maternal mortality ratio stood at 216 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. Achieving the target of less than 70 maternal deaths by 2030 requires an annual rate of reduction of at least 7.5 per cent, more than double the annual rate of progress achieved from 2000 to 2015. Most maternal deaths can be prevented. In 2016, 78 per cent of live births worldwide benefited from skilled care during delivery, compared to 61 per cent in 2000. In sub-Saharan Africa, however, the rate in 2016 was only 53 per cent of live births. 
		The mortality rate for children under 5 years of age globally was 43 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2015. That rate represents a 44 per cent reduction since 2000. Mortality among children under 5 years of age remains high in subSaharan Africa, with a rate of 84 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2015. 
		Children are most vulnerable in the first 28 days of life (the neonatal period). In 2015, the global neonatal mortality rate was 19 deaths per 1,000 live births, a decrease from 31 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2000. Neonatal mortality is highest in Central and Southern Asia and in sub-Saharan Africa, at 29 deaths per 1,000 live births in each of those regions in 2015.
		Preventing unintended pregnancies and reducing adolescent childbearing through universal access to sexual and reproductive health care is crucial to the health and well-being of women, children and adolescents. In 2017, 78 per cent of women of reproductive age (15 to 49 years of age) worldwide who were married or in union had their need for family planning satisfied with modern methods, up from 75 per cent in 2000. Progress has been substantial in the least developed countries, with a rise of 18 percentage points from 2000 to 2017. 
		Globally, the adolescent birth rate among females aged 15 to 19 declined by 21 per cent from 2000 to 2015; in Northern America and Southern Asia, it dropped by more than 50 per cent. However, the adolescent birth rate remains high in two thirds of all countries, with more than 20 births per 1,000 adolescent girls in 2015.

		Infectious diseases

		Major advances have been made in combating infectious diseases. Globally in 2015, there were 0.3 new HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infections per 1,000 uninfected people; among children under 15 years of age, there were 0.08 new HIV infections. That data represents a decline of 45 per cent and 71 per cent, respectively, since 2000. The incidence of HIV infection remained highest in sub-Saharan Africa, with 1.5 new infections per 1,000 uninfected people in 2015. 
		In 2015, 10.4 million new cases of tuberculosis were reported worldwide, which represents 142 new cases per 100,000 people, or a decline of 17 per cent since 2000. The global malaria incidence rate in 2015 was 94 per 1,000 people at risk, a 41 per cent decrease since 2000. In 2015, 1.6 billion people required mass or individual treatment and care for neglected tropical diseases, a 21 per cent decline from 2010.
		Around 1.34 million deaths were attributed to hepatitis in 2015, including 0.9 million deaths owing to hepatitis B. Hepatitis B can be prevented through vaccinations; global coverage of vaccinations for that disease among children 1 year of age increased from 29 per cent in 2000 to 84 per cent in 2015. 
		A major risk factor for infectious diseases and mortality is the lack of safe water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services, which disproportionately affects sub-Saharan Africa and Central/Southern Asia. Death rates owing to the lack of WASH services in those two regions were 46 and 23 per 100,000 people, respectively, compared to 12 per 100,000 people globally in 2012. 

		Non-communicable diseases and mental health

		Premature deaths (before 70 years of age) owing to cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic respiratory disease or diabetes totalled about 13 million in 2015, accounting for 43 per cent of all premature deaths globally. From 2000 to 2015, the risk of dying between 30 and 70 years of age from one of those four causes decreased from 23 per cent to 19 per cent, falling short of the rate required to meet the 2030 target of a one-third reduction.
		Such mental disorders as depression can lead to suicide. Nearly 800,000 suicides occurred worldwide in 2015, with men about twice as likely to commit suicide as women. 
		Tobacco and alcohol use contributes to the burden of non-communicable diseases. The World Health Organization (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control has been ratified by 180 parties, which represent 90 per cent of the global population. Still, more than 1.1 billion people, mostly men, consumed tobacco in 2015. The prevalence of smoking among those individuals 15 years of age and older dropped from 23 per cent in 2007 to 21 per cent in 2013. In 2016, the average consumption of pure alcohol was 6.4 litres per year per person among those individuals 15 years of age or older. 
		Indoor and ambient air pollution is the greatest environmental health risk. Globally in 2012, household air pollution from cooking with unclean fuels or inefficient technologies led to an estimated 4.3 million deaths, while ambient air pollution from traffic, industrial sources, waste burning or residential fuel combustion resulted in an estimated 3 million deaths. 

		Other health risks 

		In 2013, about 1.25 million people died from road traffic injuries, the leading cause of death among males between 15 and 29 years of age. Road traffic deaths have increased by about 13 per cent globally since 2000. 
		Worldwide in 2015, an estimated 108,000 people died as a result of unintentional poisoning. That figure represents 1.5 deaths per 100,000 people, a 33 per cent decrease since 2000. 

		Health systems and funding 

		In 2015, total official flows for medical research and basic health from all donor countries and multilateral organizations amounted to $9.7 billion, an increase in real terms of 30 per cent since 2010. Of that amount, the member countries of the Development Assistance Committee of OECD contributed $4.3 billion. 
		Available data from 2005 to 2015 indicate that over 40 per cent of all countries have less than one physician per 1,000 people, and around half have fewer than three nurses or midwives per 1,000 people. Almost all least developed countries have less than one physician and fewer than three nurses or midwives per 1,000 people. 



Goal 3. Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages
As much progress has been made in the health domain throughout the world, many more people currently have healthy lives than they did in previous decades. Nevertheless, far too many people die prematurely and preventable diseases still take many peoples lives. Correcting this requires concerted efforts, focusing on the demographics and regions that have been left behind. 
		Reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health
In 2015, an estimated 303,000 women throughout the world died as a result of complications of pregnancy and childbirth, with a global maternal mortality ratio of 216 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. Almost two thirds of these deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa. In the period 20122017, almost 80 per cent of live births worldwide took place with the assistance of skilled health personnel, one of the most critical interventions, up from 62 per cent in the 20002005 period. The greatest progress was made in Central and Southern Asia, from 40 per cent to 77 per cent. Sub-Saharan Africa had the lowest coverage, at 58 per cent, in the period 20122017. Worldwide, child mortality has declined substantially in recent decades. Globally, the under-5 mortality rate dropped to 41 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2016 from 78 in 2000, a 47 per cent decline. The total number of under-5 deaths dropped to 5.6 million in 2016, from 9.9 million in 2000.The neonatal mortality rate (the mortality rate for children under 28 days of age) fell by 39 per cent, from 31 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2000 to 19 in 2016. The number of neonatal deaths declined from 4 million in 2000 to 2.6 million in 2016. In 2016, sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia had the highest neonatal mortality rates, at 28 deaths per 1,000 live births. Access to modern contraceptive methods is important for the well-being of women of reproductive age (1549 years of age). Globally, among women of reproductive age who are married or in a union, the proportion whose demand for family planning is satisfied by using modern contraceptive methods increased from 74.9 per cent in 2000 to 77.4 per cent in 2018. Progress has been more significant in the least developed countries, where this proportion increased from 39.4 per cent in 2000 to 58.5 per cent in 2018. Childbearing in adolescence has declined steadily in almost all regions but remains high in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2018, the adolescent birth rate was 44 births per 1,000 women aged 1519 years globally, with the highest rate in sub-Saharan Africa, at 101.
		Infectious diseases
Globally, HIV incidence has declined from 0.40 to 0.26 per 1,000 uninfected people from 2005 to 2016, due in part to increased access to antiretroviral therapy, which sharply reduces onward transmission of HIV. Sub-Saharan Africa remains the region most heavily impacted by HIV, with HIV incidence rates at 1.28 per 1,000 uninfected people. For women of reproductive age in the region, the rate is even higher, at 2.58 per 1,000 uninfected people.The world is not on a trajectory towards ending malaria by 2030  in fact, the trends are worrisome. In 2016, there were 216 million cases of malaria, compared with 210 million cases in 2013. There were 140 new cases of tuberculosis per 100,000 people in 2016, compared with 173 cases per 100,000 people in 2000. In 2016, 1.5 billion people were reported to require mass or individual treatment and care for neglected tropical diseases, down from 1.6 billion in 2015 and 2 billion in 2010.The widespread use of the hepatitis B vaccine in infants has considerably reduced the incidence of new chronic hepatitis B virus infections  as reflected by the decline in hepatitis B prevalence among children under 5 years of age, from 4.7 per cent in the pre-vaccine era to 1.3 per cent in 2015.Unsafe drinking water, unsafe sanitation and lack of hygiene continue to be major contributors to global mortality and caused around 870,000 deaths in 2016, mainly from diarrhoeal diseases, but also from malnutrition and intestinal nematode infections. Among those, 329,000 deaths occurred in children under 5 years of age. Sub-Saharan Africa and South-Eastern Asia bear the highest disease burden.
		Non-communicable diseases and mental health
Globally, 32 million people died in 2016 from cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory disease. The probability of dying from these diseases from 30 to 70 years of age was about 18 per cent in 2016. Nearly 800,000 suicide deaths occurred in 2016, a figure unchanged from the previous year. Male suicide rates are 75 per cent higher than female suicide rates, with the highest rates in Europe, where male suicide rates are at 27.6 per 100,000 population, compared with 7.3 for women.Consumption of alcohol and tobacco has many detrimental effects on health, exacerbating the effects of non-communicable diseases. In the period 20152016, only 14 countries of the 181 that ratified the World Health Organization (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control improved their national monitoring of tobacco use, in accordance with article 20 of the Convention. In 2015, 34 per cent of men and 6 per cent of women aged 15 and older used smoking forms of tobacco. In 2016, the average annual consumption of pure alcohol was approximately 6.4 litres per person among individuals 15 years or older. Europe and Northern America, together with Australia and New Zealand had the highest consumption, at approximately 10.6 litres per person in 2016. Air pollution, whether indoor (household) or outdoor (ambient) increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer and acute lower respiratory infections. In 2016, air pollution from household and outdoor air pollution led to some 7 million deaths worldwide. Sub-Saharan Africa, most of Asia and Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand), have the highest mortality rate from air pollution.
		Other health risks
Road traffic accidents killed 1.25 million people worldwide in 2013 and injured up to 50 million more.Unintentional poisonings were responsible for over 100,000 deaths in 2016, with a steady decline over the past two decades and rates still relatively high in low-income countries.
		Health systems and funding
Globally, almost 12 per cent of the worlds population spent at least 10 per cent of their household budgets to pay for health services in 2010, up from 9.7 per cent in 2000.Immunization is one of the worlds most successful and cost-effective health interventions. Despite the increase in coverage with the required three doses of combined diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus vaccine from 72 per cent in 2000 to 86 per cent in 2016, an estimated 19.5 million children did not receive the vaccines during the first year of life, putting them at serious risk of these potentially fatal diseases. The global coverage of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is yet to reach 50 per cent. Coverage with the second dose of measles-containing vaccine increased from 10 per cent in 2000 to 64 per cent in 2016.Official development assistance (ODA) for basic health from all donors has increased by 41 per cent in real terms since 2010 and reached $9.4 billion in 2016. In 2016, about $1.9 billion was spent on malaria control, $871 million on tuberculosis control and $2 billion on other infectious diseases, excluding HIV/AIDS.Available data from 2005 to 2016 indicate that close to 45 per cent of all countries and 90 per cent of the least developed countries have less than one physician per 1,000 people, and over 60 per cent have fewer than three nurses or midwives per 1,000 people.Under the International Health Regulations, all States Parties are required to have or to develop minimum public health capacities to implement the Regulations effectively. According to the 167 responses from the 196 States parties, countries achieved an average rating of 71 per cent for all capacities associated with implementation of the Regulations in 2017.
