Indicator 2.1.1: Prevalence of undernourishment
Target 2.1: By 2030, end hunger and ensure access by all people, in particular the poor and people in vulnerable situations, including infants, to safe, nutritious and sufficient food all year round
Goal 2: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture 
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
The prevalence of undernourishment (PoU) is the proportion of the population whose habitual food consumption is insufficient to provide the dietary energy levels that are required to maintain a normal active and healthy life. It is expressed as a percentage. 
Concepts:
Undernourishment is defined as chronic hunger, a condition where a person has inadequate  access to food amounts necessary to provide the energy required for conducting a normal, health and active life, given their idividual dietary energy requirements over a period of at least one year. The concept encompasses three aspects: availability of food, inequality in access to that food, and minimum dietary energy requirements compatible with long term good health. 
The food available for human consumption is the sum of domestically produced and imported food products, minus food exports, foodwithdrawn from stocks for purposes other than human consumption (feed, seed, inducatiral use) and food losses. This is then converted into dietary energy terms expressed in kilo-calories and divided by the total population and the number of days in the year to come up with the average daily per capita dietary energy available for human consumption. This dietary energy value is used as a proxy for the habitual dietary energy consumption per capita per day. To smooth annual fluctuations, a three-year average is calculated.
The level of inequality in access to food is measured by two coefficients : (1) the variation of dietary energy consumption due to income differences derived from food consumption and income data collected in household surveys; (2) the variation of dietary energy consumption due to biological factors determining individuals’ dietary energy requirements (this coefficient is derived from anthropometric survey data on attained height by sex and age, standards on energy requirements and data on the country sex-age population structure). Inequality in access to food due to differences in socio-economic characteristics may be caused by changes in economic, socio-political and environmental factors such as physical availability of food and prices. Inequality in access to food due to factors determining individuals’ dietary energy requirements reflects differences in sex, age, physiological status, body weight and physical activity level. 
Within a probability distribution of habitual dietary energy consumption, the minimum level of dietary energy requirements, or cut-off point, is derived using energy standards established by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the World Health Organization and the United Nations University (FAO/WHO/UNU) for different sex and age groups. The minimum level of requirements correspondons to sedentary physical activity and minimum acceptable body-weight for attained heights. Since adults’energy needs almost double the energy needed by a three-year old child, the estimation of the minimum energy requirement per capita in a country must take into account the sex-age structure of the population. Therefore, the daily per capita energy requirements used as cut-off point, for estimating undernourishment in a given year, is calculated at national level, based on dietary energy needs of different age and sex groups, and the proportion of the population represented by each sex-age group. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
This indicator measures the level of dietary energy inadequacy, an important aspect of food insecurity in a population and the capacity to sustain  development which demands efforts to reduce poverty, including finding solutions to hunger and malnutrition. Alleviating hunger is a prerequisite for sustainable poverty reduction since undernourishment seriously affects, among other things, labour productivity, health and learning capacity and hence earning propensity.  Within a country, this indicator allows monitoring trends in the extent of dietary energy inadequacy in a population, generated as a result of the combination of changes in the overall availability of food, in households’ ability to access it, and in socio-economic, geographic location and demographic characteristics of the population. It also allows the analysis of differences across countries and global regions in any given moment in time. 
The indicator ranges from 0 per cent (no undernourished population) to 100 per cent (the entire population is undernourished). Within a given country, a higher value of this indicator, means that more people suffer from undernourishment (food deprivation). Among countries, a higher value does not necessarily mean a higher number of people undernourished because it depends on the size of the total population. The following undernourishment categories are the most commonly used:
	•	<5% Very low
	•	5% - >14.9% Moderately low
	•	15% - >24.9% Moderately high
	•	25% - >34.9% High
	•	35% and over Very high
Changes in the indicator guide governments and international organizations in formulating policies and implementing actions towards: improving food availability and access by the population, decreasing the negative impact of a rise in income inequalities and coping with trends in food needs. 
Data Sources and Collection Method
The three main sources of data at the national level, that are used for monitorig of the PoU at national level, are:
(1)    Official reports on the production, trade and utilization of major food crops and livestock;
(2)    Household survey data on food consumption; and
(3)    Demographic characteristics of the national population. 
Data sources for agricultural production are usually national surveys that are conducted by the Ministry of Agricultural/Livestock or the National Statistical Office. The surveys are usually annual, and in the absence of direct measurements, use information on areas/animal numbers and crop yields/carcass weights to calculate crop or livestock product quantities. Agricultural censuses may complement these surveys by providing more updated data on crops and livestock, and thus enable more precise projections/revisions. For production of processed crops the sources are agriculture holdings and/or food and agriculture enterprises. For trade, all crops and livestock products registered by the custom office in the country are taken into consideration. In case of non custom trade data, the observation unit is the trade operator. 
The ideal source of data to estimate the inequality in access to food would be a carefully designed and skilfully conducted individual dietary intake survey, in which actual daily food consumption, together with heights and weights for each surveyed individual, are repeatedly measured on a sample that is representative of the target population. However, a well-designed household survey that collects information on food consumption and/or acquisition might be sufficient to inform a reliable estimate for inequality in access to food. Such surveys are generally conducted by the national statistical office of countries. Some examples are Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES), Household Budget Surveys (HBS) and Living Standard Measurement Surveys (LSMS). 
The data on demographic characteristics such as: (1) population size by sex and age, (2) median height by sex and age, and (3) distribution of physical activity levels, is derived from nationally representative Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Time-Use Surveys. They are also conducted by the national statistical offices.
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
The estimates of the prevalence of undernourishment are essentially a measure of food deprivation based on the calculation of four key parameters for each country: the average amount of habitual daily per capita food consumption (the food available for human consumption is used as a proxy), the level of inequality in access to food, the asymmetry in the distribution of habitual per capita consumption and the minimum dietary energy requirements of the population under analysis. 
This indicator has been defined within a probability distribution framework as follows:
 ￼  
where,
	•	P(U) is the proportion of undernourished in total population;
	•	DEC is the average of the distribution of habitual daily per capita dietary energy consumption in the population;
	•	CV is the coefficient of variation of the distribution of habitual daily per capita dietary energy consumption in the population;
	•	Skewness is the skewnes that characterise the asymetry of the distribution of habitual daily per capita dietary energy consumption in the population; and
	•	MDER is the minimum dietary energy requirements of the population. 
For computational methodologies of DEC, CV, MDER and Skewness using household survey data, see: http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4046e.pdf and https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/18091 
Comments and limitations: 
Assessing undernourishment by comparing individual dietary energy consumption (collected through individual dietary intake surveys) with sex-age groups’ energy requirements is not cost effective, or practical; therefore, just few countries conduct such type of surveys at national level. 
The model-based approach developed by FAO offers the best alternative approach to provide with a consistent and reliable measure of the PoU to be used for global monitoring of hunger given the information available.
In the absence of nationally representative individual dietary intake surveys, particularly in low and middle-income countries, food consumption data collected in Household Consumption and Expenditures Surveys (HCES) represent a valid and affordable second source of food. However, a most of individual or household surveys are subject to measurement errors: random and systematic errors. If these later are not accounted for can they affect the estimates of the population’ parameters. For instance, dietary energy consumption estimates could be underestimated due to underreporting of consumption by survey respondents. Respondents also sometimes fail to account for food consumed outside of the household. 
In context of the global monitoring, providing an estimate for all countries would require access to national survey data on food intake or consumption for all countries. As such information is not available, a proxy value for habitual dietary energy consumption is calculated using information on food available for human consumption in a country obtained from Food Balance Sheets (FBS). FBS are compiled, by FAO, every year for 184 countries. However, these data are also not free from errors, there are estimated or imputed data points especially on the stock levels and FAO concepts may not fit with national concepts. To limit the effect of such errors, the PoU estimates reported for global monitoring refers to a 3-year average. 
Survey data are the only source to estimate the CV and Skewness and the data need to be treated to reduce the upward bias in the estimates that is induced by the spurious variability from measurement errors before estimating the CV and the Skewness. 
If the same method of computation is used throughout, the comparability across time is relatively high. The only potential cause of heterogeneity is the different quality of background data used for calculating the four parameters. 
Proxy, alternative and additional indicators: N/A
Data Disaggregation
Due to reliance on national Food Balance Sheets data to estimate mean caloric consumption levels anualy for 184 countries, the global monitoring of MDG Target 1C and of the WFS target were based on estimates of the PoU at national level only. For the same reason, the FAO global monitoring of the SDG indicator 2.1.1 is also being based on Food Balance Sheets. 
In principle, the SDG indicator 2.1.1 can be computed for any specific population group, provided sufficient accurate information exists to characterize the model’s parameters (i.e. average habitual dietary energy consumption, the level of inadequality in access to food and the minimum dietary energy requirement) for that specific group.  
The scope for disaggregation thus crucially depends on the availability of surveys designed to be representative at the level of sub national population groups. Given prevailing practice in the design of national household surveys, sufficient reliable information is seldom available for disaggregation beyond the level of macro area of residence (urban-rural) and of the main Provinces/Divisions in a country. To the extent that most of the used surveys are designed to accurately capture the distribution of income, inference can be drawn on the PoU in different income classes of the population. Gender disaggregation is limited by the possibility to identify and group households by gender-related information (such as sex of the head of the household, or male/female ratio).
Indicator 2.1.2: Prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity in the  population, based on the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES)
Target 2.1: By 2030, end hunger and ensure access by all people, in particular the poor and people in vulnerable situations, including infants, to safe, nutritious and sufficient food all year round
Goal 2:  End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
The indicator is defined as the share of the national population that has experienced food insecurity, based on the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES), at moderate or severe levels during the reference period. FIES is a peer reviewed measurement metric developed by the FAO, under the Voices of the Hungry (VOH) project, to compare levels of food insecurity across countries. 
Concepts:
Food insecurity is a situation that exists when people lack secure access to sufficient amounts of safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life. Food insecurity may be chronic, seasonal or transitory. 
People experiencing moderate levels of food insecurity will typically have lower-quality diets and may at times during the year have been forced to also reduce the quantity of food they would normally eat; those experiencing severe levels would have gone for entire days without eating due to lack of money or other resources. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
Food insecurity is associated with the inability to access safe, nutritious and sufficient food regularly. 
High prevalence of food insecurity at moderate levels can be considered a predictor of various forms of diet-related health conditions in the population, associated with micronutrient deficiency and unbalanced diets. Severe levels of food insecurity, on the other hand, imply a high probability of reduced food intake and therefore can lead to more severe forms of undernutrition, including hunger.
Data Sources and Collection Method
Some countries in the world are already using experience-based food insecurity scales that have been validated nationally and applied in national surveys and/or are incorporated into national monitoring systems. Most of these scales are based on the same theoretical framework and construct of food insecurity as the FIES.
Data at the individual or household level can be collected using one of several experience-based food security scale questionnaires.  Any of these survey modules collects answers to questions asking to report on the occurrence of a number of typical experiences and conditions associated with food insecurity:
(1)    the Household Food Security Survey Module (HFSSM) developed by the Economic Research Service of the US Department of Agriculture, and used in the US and Canada, https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/50764/qn2016.pdf?v=42984
(2)    the Latin American and Caribbean Food Security Scale (or Escala Latinoamericana y Caribeña de Seguridad Alimentaria – ELCSA), used in Guatemala and tested in several other Spanish speaking countries in Latin America, http://www.fao.org/3/a-i3065s.pdf,https://coin.fao.org/coin-static/cms/media/9/13155829028740/validacion_elcsa_guatemala.pdf
(3)    the Mexican Food Security Scale (or Escala Mexicana de Seguridad Alimentaria, - EMSA), an adaptation of the ELCSA used in Mexico, http://www.medigraphic.com/pdfs/veracruzana/muv-2014/muv142c.pdf
(4)    the Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale (Escala Brasileira de medida de la Insegurança Alimentar – EBIA) used in Brazil, http://www.bvsde.paho.org/texcom/nutricion/memredsan_3.pdf,  https://biblioteca.ibge.gov.br/visualizacao/livros/liv91984.pdf or
(5)    the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS),  http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/eufao-fsi4dm/doc-training/hfias.pdf 
The above modules can also be adapted to local needs, as long as the results can be calibrated for use with the FIES. 
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
The indicator can be calculdated by analyzing survey data using the Rasch model (also known as one-parameter logistic model, 1-PL), which postulates that the probability of observing an affirmative answer by respondent i to question j, is a logistic function of the distance, on an underlying scale of severity, between the position of the respondent, 𝑎𝑖, and that of the item, 𝑏𝑗. Parameters 𝑎𝑖 and 𝑏𝑗 can be estimated using maximum likelihood procedures. Parameters 𝑎𝑖, in particular, are interpreted as a measure of the severity of the food security condition for each respondent and are used to classify them into classes of food insecurity.
￼ 
 
 
 
Through the estimation of the Rasch model using the conditional maximum likelihood method and the assumption that individuals with the same raw score (sum of affirmative answers to the FIES questions) belong to the same distribution of food insecurity, it is possible to estimates the probability of being moderately or severely food insecure (𝑝mod+sev) and the probability of being severely food insecure (𝑝sev) for each respondent, with 0 <𝑝sev <𝑝mod+sev < 1.
Given a representative sample, the prevalence of food insecurity at moderate or severe levels (FImod+sev), and at severe levels (FIsev) in the population are computed as the weighted sum of the probability of belonging to the moderate or severe food insecurity class, and to the severe food insecurity class, respectively, of all individual or household respondents in a sample:
￼
and
￼
where 𝑤𝑖 are post-stratification weights that indicate the proportion of individual or households in the national population represented by each element in the sample.
Comments and limitations:
Compared to other proposed non-official indicators of household food insecurity, such as those based on the Food Consumption Score or on the Coping Strategy Index, or on the recently released “Comprehensive Approach to Report Indicators” (CARI), the “Food Insecurity Experience Scale” (FIES) based approach has the advantage that food insecurity prevalence rates are directly comparable across population groups and countries. Even if they use similar labels (such as  “moderate” and “severe” food insecurity) other approaches have yet to demonstrate the formal comparability of the thresholds used for classification, due to lack of the definition of a proper statistical models that links the values of the “indexes” or “scores” used for classification, to the severity of food insecurity.  For this reason, care should be taken when comparing the results obtained with the FIES with those obtained with these other indicators, even if, unfortunately, similar labels are used to describe them.
Compared to the other indicators used to assess the state of food security at national level, experience-based food insecurity scales like the FIES stand out for the following reasons:
a) Directly ask people about food-related behaviors and experiences associated with food insecurity. b) Ease of administration and timeliness of reporting. c) Soundness of the statistical basis used to enable cross-country comparisons based on information collected on individuals or households. d) Ability to reflect the depth of food insecurity by distinguishing between different severity levels. e) Possibility to disaggregate results by gender when applied at individual level and by sub national groups when applied in surveys with samples that are representative at sub-national level. f) Provides actionable information that policy makers can use to identify vulnerable population groups and guide policy interventions.
The FIES is not intended to quantify food consumption nor does it provide a quantitative assessment of dietary quality. It is not a measure of malnutrition and cannot be used to detect nutritional deficiencies or obesity.
Proxy, alternative and additional indicators: N/A
Data Disaggregation
The full potential of the FIES to generate statistics that can inform policy is realized when the tool is applied in larger national population surveys that enable more detailed analyses of the food insecurity situation according to income, gender, age, race, ethnicity, migratory status, disability, geographic location, or other policy-relevant characteristics, as is already the case for a number of countries.
In this way, it’s possible to obtain prevalence of food insecurity of specific population groups.
Indicator 2.2.1: Prevalence of stunting (height for age <-2 standard deviation from the median of the World Health Organization (WHO) Child Growth Standards) among children under 5 years of age
Target 2.2: By 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under 5 years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women and older persons
Goal 2: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the percentage of children aged 0–59 months, whose length or height-for-age values are below minus two standard deviations from the WHO Child Growth Standards median.  
Concepts:
Stunting refers to a situation where a child is too short for his or her age due to the result of chronic or recurrent malnutrition.  Also known as linear growth retardation, it is a condition that occurs mainly in the first 2 years of life and that is largely irreversible. WHO Child Growth Standards provide reference median information for this indicator  (http://www.who.int/childgrowth/en/). 
Rationale and Interpretation:
Child growth is an internationally accepted outcome reflecting child nutritional status. Given stunting’s association with morbidity and mortality risk, non-communicable diseases in later life, and learning capacity and productivity, it can lead to a negative impact on country’s development. Child stunting is one of the nutrition global target indicators endorsed by the World Health Assembly.  The targets for stunting are to reduce the number of children stunted by 40% (by 2025) and by 50% (by 2030), from the 2012 baseline.
Data Sources and Collection Method
For most of the countries, nationally representative nutritional (household) surveys collect information on height (or length)- for-age data. For a limited number of countries data from surveillance/early-warning systems that are in place to continuously collect, analyse and interpret health-related data, are used if sufficient population coverage is documented (about 80%). For both data sources, the child’s height measurements must be collected following recommended standard measuring techniques (WHO 2008). For accurate child linear growth assessment, the complete date of birth should be available. These data are generally collected by the ministries of health, national offices of statistics or national institutes of nutrition. 
Internationally, there are also several other survey programmes that provide anthropometric data, including the Multiple-Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) supported by UNICEF, the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) funded by United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Pan-Arab Project for Child Development (PAPCHILD) surveys funded by the Pan-Arab League and UNFPA, the Living Standards Measurement Studies (LSMS) , funded by the World Bank, and National Nutrition Surveys based on Standardized Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transition (SMART) methods
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
The indicator can be calculated as a simple percentage, as follows:
 ￼
Where,
CS is the number of children under the age of 5 years who are stunted (i.e. length or height-for-age is more than two SD below the WHO Child Growth Standards median); and
CT is the total number of children under the age of 5 years measured. 
The WHO Child Growth Standards can be found at: http://www.who.int/childgrowth/standards/height_for_age/en/ 
Comments and limitations:
Survey estimates come with levels of uncertainty due to both sampling and non-sampling error (e.g. measurement technical error, recording error etc.). While sampling errors are available for the a large number of country surveys, in the database, none of the two sources of errors have been fully considered for deriving estimates at regional and global levels. 
Proxy, alternative and additional indicators: N/A
Data Disaggregation
Prevalence of stunting in children less than 5 years of age should be presented for the total sample and disaggregated by age, sex, type of residence, region, socioeconomic status and mothers’ education.
Indicator 2.2.2: Prevalence of malnutrition (weight for height >+2 or <-2 standard deviation from the median of the WHO Child Growth Standards) among children under 5 years of age, by type (wasting and overweight)
Target 2.2: By 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under 5 years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women and older persons
Goal 2: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture
Definition and Rationale
Definition: 
The indicator consists of two parts, wasting and overweight: 
	1.	Wasting is the percentage of children aged 0–59 months, whose weight-for-length or height values are below minus two standard deviations from the WHO Child Growth Standards median. 
	2.	Overweight is the percentage of children aged 0–59 months, whose weight-for-length or height values are above two standard deviations from the WHO Child Growth Standards median. 
Concepts:
For the purposes of this indicator, wasting refers to a situation where a child under 5 years of age is too thin for his or her height,  due to rapid weight loss or the failure to gain weight. A child who is wasted has an increased risk of death, but treatment is possible. 
For the purposes of this indicator, overweight  refers to a child who is too heavy for his or her height. This form of malnutrition results from expending too few calories for food consumed and increases the risk of noncommunicable diseases later in life. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
Wasting is a major health problem and, owing to its associated risks for morbidity, requires urgent attention from policy-makers and programme implementers alike. This indicator has been linked to poverty, low levels of education, and poor access to health services. Addressing wasting is of critical importance because of the heightened risk of disease and death for children who lose too much of their body weight. 
Overweight and obese children are likely to stay obese into adulthood and more likely to develop noncommunicable diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular diseases at a younger age. Overweight and obesity, as well as their related diseases, are largely preventable. 
Under-five wasting is an internationally accepted outcome reflecting extreme child undernourishment and was also a part of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). On the other end of the spectrum, obesity in children is another rising epidemic which occurs due to over-nourishment and consumption of unbalanced and unhealthy foods and is also linked to physical inactivity. Being overweight also impacts cognitive function and impedes individuals’ ability to lead productive lives.
Childhood wasting and overweight are both part of the nutrition global target indicators endorsed by the World Health Assembly.    The targets for wasting are to reduce the percentage of children wasted to <5% by 2025 and to <3% (very low level) by 2030; the targets for overweight are to have no increase in the percentage of children overweight from the 2012 baseline in 2025, and to reduce the percentage of children overweight to <3% (very low level).
Data Sources and Collection Method
For most of the countries, nationally representative nutritional (household) surveys collect information on height (or length) and weight data. For a limited number of countries, data from surveillance/early-warning systems that are in place to continuously collect, analyse and interpret health-related data, are used if sufficient population coverage is documented (about 80%). For both data sources, the child’s height and weight measurements must be collected following recommended standard measuring techniques (WHO 2008). This data are generally collected by the ministries of health, national offices of statistics or national institutes of nutrition. 
Internationally, there are also several other survey programmes that provide anthropometric data, including the Multiple-Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) supported by UNICEF, the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) funded by United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Pan-Arab Project for Child Development (PAPCHILD) surveys funded by the Pan-Arab League and UNFPA, the Living Standards Measurement Studies (LSMS), funded by the World Bank, and National Nutrition Surveys based on Standardized Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transition  (SMART) methods. 
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
The indicator can be calculated as a simple percentage for the various types of malnutrition, as follows:
 ￼
where Cwasting is the number of children under the age of 5 years who are wasted (i.e. weight-for-length/height is below minus two SD from the WHO Child Growth Standards median); Coverweight is the number of children under the age of 5 years who are overweight (i.e. weight-for-length/height is above plus two SD from the WHO Child Growth Standards median); and
CTotal is the total number of children under the age of 5 years measured for both weight and height. 
The WHO child growth standards that provide reference median information for this indicator can be found at: http://www.who.int/childgrowth/standards/weight_for_age/en/ 
Comments and limitations:
Survey estimates come with levels of uncertainty due to both sampling error and non-sampling error (e.g. measurement technical error, recording error etc.). While sampling errors are available for the a large number of country surveys in the database, none of the two sources of errors have been fully considered for deriving estimates at regional and global levels. Surveys are carried out in a specific period of the year, usually over a few months. However, the wasting indicator can be affected by seasonality, factors related to food availability (e.g. pre-harvest periods), disease (e.g. rainy season and diarrhoea, malaria, etc.), and natural disasters and conflicts. Hence, country-year estimates may not necessarily be comparable over time. 
Proxy, alternative and additional indicators: N/A
Data Disaggregation
Prevalence of both wasting and overweight in children less than 5 years of age should be presented for the total sample and disaggregated by age, sex, area of residence, region, socioeconomic status and mothers’ education.
Indicator 2.5.1: Number of plant and animal genetic resources for food and agriculture secured in either medium or long-term conservation facilities
Target 2.5: By 2020, maintain the genetic diversity of seeds, cultivated plants and farmed and domesticated animals and their related wild species, including through soundly managed and diversified seed and plant banks at the national, regional and international levels, and promote access to and fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge, as internationally agreed
Goal 2: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the number of plant and animal genetic resource for food and agriculture (GRFA) that have been stored in medium or long-term facilities as a means of genetic resource conservation worldwide.  Plant and animal genetic resources are counted separately. 
Concepts: 
<Plant Genetic Resources>
The number of plant genetic resource refers to the number of accessions of plant genes that are in the medium or long-term conservation facilities for storage, where accession refers to a distinct sample of seed or planting material. FAO’s Gene Bank Standards for Plant Genetic Resources sets the benchmark for current scientific and technical best practices. 
Medium or long-term conservation facilities refer to storage facilities, or gene banks of a base or core collection in the form of seeds in cold rooms, plants in the field and tissues in vitro and/or cryopreserved, where a base collection is defined as a set of unique accessions. The preservation period is designed to be sufficiently enough to fulfil the conservation purposes (not commercial utilization), and it may vary according to the type of storage, species and kind of material stored. 
<Animal Genetic Resources>
The number of animal genetic resource refers to the number of local breeds stored within gene banks with amounts necessary for a breed’s reconstitution as per FAO’s Guidelines on Cryo-conservation of Animal Genetic Resources, where a breed is either a sub-specific group of domestic livestock with definable and identifiable external characteristics that enable it to be separated by visual appraisal from other similarly defined groups within the same species, or a group for which geographical and/or cultural separation from phenotypically similar groups has led to acceptance of its separate identity. 
Medium or long-term conservation facilities refer to storage facilities, or gene banks. They include both the maintenance of live animals (in vivo) and the collection and deep-freezing of semen, ova, embryos or tissues for potential future use in breeding or regenerating animals. The preservation period is designed to be sufficiently enough to fulfil the conservation purposes (not commercial utilization), and it may vary according to the type of storage, species and kind of material stored. 
Rationale and Interpretation: 
Genetic resources for food and agriculture provide the building blocks of food security and, directly or indirectly, support the livelihoods of every person on earth. As the conservation and accessibility to these resources is of vital importance, this indicator facilitate the monitoring of diversity secured and accessible through genebanks and support the development and updating of strategies for the conservation and sustainable use of genetic resources. 
This indicator provides an indirect measurement of the total genetic diversity which that is secured for future use. 
Caution needs to be paid in interpreting the indicator. In the case of plant genetic resources, an uncontrolled addition of accessions could be duplicates of samples already conserved and accounted for. 
Data Sources and Collection Method
Countries can collect this information from the gene bank (or holding institute) that they use (domestic or international) for the storage of their plant and animal genetic resources. 
Officially appointed national focal points and national coordinators, under the monitoring framework endorsed by the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, are responsible for reporting national data to:
(1)    The World Information and Early Warning System (WIEWS) for plant genetic resources; and
(2)    The Domestic Animal Diversity Information System (DAD-IS) for animal genetic resources. 
For the plant component of the indicator, accession level information is reported for a set of thirteen descriptors, four of these descriptors are mandatory. Mandatory descriptors are: (i) the name or WIEWS code of the genebank holding the material, (ii) the unique identifier of the material within the genebank, (iii) its taxonomic classification (genus, species and subtaxon), and (iv) the type of storage.
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
The two components of this indicator, i.e. (1) plant genetic resources and (2) animal genetic resources, are to be calculated separately. Each component is calculated by summing the number of unique plant genetic materials, or breeds of animal genetic materials that are stored in medium or long-term conservation facilities.  
Comments and limitations:
<Plant Genetic Resources>
There are two major factors that could lead to an overestimation of this indicator, and precautions need to be taken to minimize such errors. First factor is the counting of duplicate accessions, and the second is the counting of materials whose loss of viability has not been detected in time to be regenerated.  
The indicator would be highly overestimated if countries report accessions in both their base and active collections, as genetic diversity in active collections is expected to be adequately represented in the base collections. Therefore, accessions in base collections should be primarily reported. Accessions in active collections could be exceptionally reported, only if they are (i) not yet, but expected to become part of the national base collections, (ii) unique, and (iii) conserved under medium/long-term conservation facilities. Furthermore the proper documentation of the collections through the use of internationally applied standard and an effective database management system (e.g. GRIN Global) is an important prerequisite for an efficient handling of the genebank collections and to avoid or detect duplicate reporting. 
Similarly, viability testing and rejuvenation of stored seed samples are part of the norms and procedures that every genebank conserving collections for the medium or long term is expected to perform routinely. 
A base collection is defined as a set of unique accessions to be preserved for a medium to long-term period. An active collection is defined as a set of distinct accessions that is used for regeneration, multiplication, distribution, characterization and evaluation. Active collections are maintained in short to medium-term storage and usually duplicated in a base collection. 
Another potential issue that needs to be monitored, both while reporting and interpreting the results, is the grouping or splitting of accessions. In both cases, the variation in the accounted number does not reflect a variation in the genetic diversity conserved and secured. Therefore, it is crucial that reporting countries and stakeholders together with the accession level information requested explain also the reason for the decrease or increase in the number of accessions when this does not reflect a real loss or gain in the genetic diversity conserved and secured. 
<Animal Genetic Resources>
To collect animal genetic resources data on a regular basis, the Domestic Animal Diversity Information System (DAD-IS) has been amended. The new DAD-IS version was launched in November 2017 and allows now to report on a yearly base on the type and amount of genetic material stored (e.g. semen, embryos, oocytes, number of donors…) for each breed. 
Proxy, alternative and additional indicators: N/A
Data Disaggregation
The country reporting on an annual basis allows for both geographic and temporal data disaggregation. 
For the plant component of the indicator, data can be disaggregated according to the mandatory descriptors described above. Additional levels of data disaggregation can be provided by optional accession-level descriptors, including the date of acquisition, the type of material conserved, the latitude and longitude of the collecting site. 
As countries report on their national cryoconservation programmes for animal genetic resources, the indicator can be disaggregated by cryo-programme and year, further it can be distinguished between mammalian and avian species or by single species. 
Data for the levels of disaggregation mentioned above can be found in WIEWS and DAD-IS for plants and animals respectively. 
Indicator 2.5.2: Proportion of local breeds classified as being at risk, not-at-risk or at unknown level of risk of extinction
Target 2.5: By 2020, maintain the genetic diversity of seeds, cultivated plants and farmed and domesticated animals and their related wild species, including through soundly managed and diversified seed and plant banks at the national, regional and international levels, and promote access to and fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge, as internationally agreed
Goal 2: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
The indicator presents the percentage of local livestock breeds classified as being at risk, not at risk or at unknown level of risk of extinctions at a certain moment in time. 
Concepts:
Breed referes to either a subspecific group of domestic livestock with definable and identifiable external characteristics that enable it to be separated by visual appraisal from other similarly defined groups within the same species, or a group for which geographical and or cultural separation from phenotypically separate groups has led to acceptance of  its separate identity and/or a group for which geographical and/or cultural separation from phenotypically similar groups has led to acceptance of its separate identity. For the purposes of the guidelines, a breed is a subspecific group of domestic livestock with a common history whose members are treated in a common manner with respect to genetic management. 
At-risk breed  refers to breeds with demographic characteristics (primarily population census size) suggesting that it will fail to exist in the future unless a conservation programme is implemented. Breed risk status is a complex issue, first because numerous factors are involved, but also because all the information needed to estimate the parameters necessary for predicting risk status is rarely available. 
Following criteria determine the level of risk for a local breed:
(1)    Extinct: a breed is categorized as extinct when there are no breeding males or breeding females remaining. Nevertheless, genetic material might have been cryo-conserved which would allow recreation of the breed.
(2)    Critical: a breed is categorized as critical if the total number of breeding females is less than or equal to 100 or the total number of breeding males is less than or equal to five; or the overall population size is less than or equal to 120 and decreasing and the percentage of females being bred to males of the same breed is below 80 percent, and it is not classified as extinct.
(3)    Critical-maintained: are those critical populations for which active conservation programmes are in place or populations are maintained by commercial companies or research institutions.
(4)    Endangered: a breed is categorized as endangered if the total number of breeding females is greater than 100 and less than or equal to 1000 or the total number of breeding males is less than or equal to 20 and greater than five; or the overall population size is greater than 80 and less than 100 and increasing and the percentage of females being bred to males of the same breed is above 80 percent; or the overall population size is greater than 1 000 and less than or equal to 1 200 and decreasing and the percentage of females being bred to males of the same breed is below 80 percent, and it is not assigned to any of above categories.
(5)    Endangered-maintained: are those endangered populations for which active conservation programmes are in place or populations are maintained by commercial companies or research institutions.
(6)    Vulnerable. A breed is categorized as vulnerable if:
	◦	the total number of breeding females is between 1 000 and 2 000 (3 000 and 6 000 for species with low reproductive capacity); or
	◦	the overall population size is greater than 800 (2 400) and less than or equal to 1 600 (4 800) and increasing and the percentage of females being bred to males of the same breed is greater than 80 percent; or
	◦	the overall population size is greater than 1 200 (3 600) and less than or equal to 2 400 (7 200) but stable or decreasing; or
	◦	the total number of breeding males is between 20 and 35 (i.e. the ΔF is between 0.5 and 1 percent).
Unreported population trends are assumed to be stable.
(7)    Not at risk. A breed is categorized as not at risk if the population status is known and the breed does not fall in the critical or endangered categories (including the respective subcategories) or the vulnerable category. In addition, a breed can be considered not at risk even if the precise population size is not known, as long as existing knowledge is sufficient
to provide certainty that the population size exceeds the respective thresholds for the vulnerable category. To allow more such breeds to be correctly assigned to the not at risk category (i.e. rather than classified as unknown), countries are encouraged to insert estimated population sizes into DAD-IS if data from a formal census are not available. Nevertheless,
for such breeds the implementation of a survey to obtain a more precise estimate of population size is strongly recommended (FAO, 2011b).
(8)    Unknown. This category is self-explanatory and calls for action. A population survey is needed; the breed could be critical, endangered or vulnerable.
(9)    At risk: all breeds falling under categories 2 to 6 
A detailed definition on risk classification is provided in
FAO. 2013. In vivo conservation of animal genetic resources.
FAO Animal Production and Health Guidelines. No. 14. Rome. Accessible at  http://www.fao.org/docrep/018/i3327e/i3327e.pdf 
Rationale and Interpretation:
Animal genetic resources for food and agriculture are an essential part of the biological basis for world food security, and contribute to the livelihoods of over a billion people. A diverse resource base is critical for human survival and well-being, and a contribution to the eradication of hunger and malnutrition. 
In addition, the indicator has a direct link to “biodiversity” as animal or livestock genetic resources represent an integral part of agricultural ecosystems and biodiversity as such. 
Data Sources and Collection Method
The data that supports the calculations for this indicator can be collected from national livestock censuses on breed level or data derived from national herdbooks or national surveys. Updating of population size data at least every 10 years is needed for the definition of the risk classes.
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
Local breeds are to be classified using information available through agricultural livestock data collection systems. Based on the population size and sex ratios of livestock for each breed, it is to be determined whether they are at risk, not-at-risk or unknown level of risk using the aforementioned criteria. 
Once all breeds have been classified, the indicator(s) can be calculated using the following formulas:
￼
Comments and limitations:
Breed-related information remains far from complete. For almost 60 percent of all reported breeds, risk status is not known because of missing population data or lack of recent updates. Generally, data collection should be possible in all countries.
The main limitation is the availability of livestock census on breed level. The guidelines on Surveying and Monitoring give an overview on methods to estimate population sizes if no census data are available.

Indicator 2.a.1: The agriculture orientation index for government expenditures
Target 2.a: Increase investment, including through enhanced international cooperation, in rural infrastructure, agricultural research and extension services, technology development and plant and livestock gene banks in order to enhance agricultural productive capacity in developing countries, in particular least developed countries
Goal 2: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
The Agriculture Orientation Index (AOI) for Government Expenditures is defined as the Agriculture Share of Central Government Expenditure, divided by the Agriculture Share of GDP, where Agriculture refers to the agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting sector. Government Expenditures are compiled according to the international Classification of the Functions of Government (COFOG), and Agriculture Share of GDP according to the System of National Accounts (SNA).
 Concepts:
Government expenditures are based on the IMF Government Finance Statistics (GFS) methodology, and are defined as expenses plus the net investment in non-financial assets. They include compensation of employees, subsidies and grants paid as transfers to individuals or corporations, acquisitions of non-financial assets, etc. In particular, Government Expenditure on Agriculture includes all the expenditures that fall under the COFOG group 04.2 (Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing) of the Classification of the Functions of Government (COFOG).
 Agriculture share of GDP refers to the share of contribution to the GDP from the agricultural sector where, agriculture refers to the agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting sector, or Division A of International Standard of Industry Classification (ISIC) Rev 4 (equal to Division A+B of ISIC Rev 3.2).
Rationale and Interpretation:
Government spending in agriculture includes spending on sector policies and programs; soil improvement and soil degradation control; irrigation and reservoirs for agricultural use; animal health management, livestock research and training in animal husbandry; marine/freshwater biological research; afforestation and other forestry projects; etc.
Spending in these agricultural activities helps to increase sector efficiency, productivity and income growth by increasing physical or human capital and /or reducing inter-temporal budget constraints. However, the private sector typically under-invests in these activities due to the presence of market failure (e.g. the public good nature of research and development; the positive externalities from improved soil and water conditions; lack of access to competitive credit due to asymmetric information between producers and financial institutions, etc.). Similarly, the high risk faced by agricultural producers, particular smallholders unable to hedge against risk, often requires government intervention in terms of income redistribution to support smallholders in distress following crop failures and livestock loss from pests, droughts, floods, infrastructure failure, or severe price changes.
Government spending in agriculture is essential to address these market failures and need for income redistribution.
An Agriculture Orientation Index (AOI) greater than 1 reflects a higher share of government spending in the agriculture sector, relative to the sector’s share in overall GDP. An AOI less than 1 reflects a lower share of government spending in the agricultural sector, relative to the sector’s share in overall GDP. An AOI of 1 reflects neutrality in a government’s orientation to the agriculture sector. The AOI is a currency-free measure and allows for comparison across countries with different agricultural sector size through viewing government expenditures into agriculture relative to the size of the agricultural sector of the country. 
Data Sources and Collection Method
Data on government expenditures are collected from countries (Department of Finance or other central planning agency, National Statistics Office, and/or Ministry of Agriculture), using an annual questionnaire administered by FAO. For some countries that do not report such data to FAO, data may be obtained from the IMF Government Finance Statistics (GFS) database (the IMF also collects data on Government Expenditure by COFOG, but with less disaggregation of the Agriculture sector) or from official national governmental websites. 
Data on agriculture value-added and GDP are based on the System of National Accounts (SNA), which is an analytical framework that compiles national data from a mix of survey, census and administrative (e.g. tax) sources. This data is obtained from the UN Statistics Division, which provides national accounts estimates for 220 countries and territories.
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
The Agriculture Orientation Index can be calculated using the following formula:
￼
where,
Agriculture share of government expenditure is the proportion of total central government expenditure spent on the agricultural sector based on the COFOG classification; and
Agriculture share of GDP is the total value added in the agricultural sector as a proportion of the total value added in the economy (GDP). This is based on the Division A of International Standard of Industry Classification (ISIC) Rev 4. 
Comments and limitations:
Since the numerator of this data is based on administrative sources, there is no confidence interval or standard error associated with government expenditure data. For the denominator, national accounts data typically do not provide any standard error or confidence interval information.
The key limitation with this indicator is that it takes into account only central government expenditure. To the extent that some countries may have heavier intervention in Agriculture by sub-national governments, this will not be taken into account.
In addition, AOI equal to 1 may not be the right target for a country, due to differences in degrees of decentralization, and degrees of market failure and income redistribution policies. Additionally, comparing an AOI within a country over time should be done along with its two components (the Agriculture share of Government Expenditures and the Agriculture Value Added Share of GDP), and in the context of the severity of market failure and agriculture sector income inequalities.
Proxy, alternative and additional indicators: N/A
Data Disaggregation
Since this indicator is based on central government expenditures, which does not take into account the demographics of beneficiaries, it does not allow for data disaggregation.
Indicator 2.a.2: Total official flows (official development assistance plus other official flows) to the agriculture sector
Target 2.a: Increase investment, including through enhanced international cooperation, in rural infrastructure, agricultural research and extension services, technology development and plant and livestock gene banks in order to enhance agricultural productive capacity in developing countries, in particular least developed countries
Goal 2: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
Total official flows are the gross disbursements of total Official Development Assistance (ODA) and other official flows from all donors to the agriculture sector. 
Concepts:
Official Development Assistance (ODA) is defined by OECD’s Development Assistance Committee (DAC) as those flows to countries and territories on the DAC list of ODA recipients and to multilateral institutions which are:
(1)    Provided by official agencies, including state and local governments, or by their executive agencies; and
(2)    Each transaction if which:
(a) is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; and
(b) is concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25 percent (calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent). 
Other Official Flows (OOF) are defined as transactions by the official sector which do not meet the conditions for eligibility as ODA, either because they are not primarily aimed at development, or because they are not sufficiently concessional. They also exclude officially supported export credits. 
The agriculture sector is as defined by the DAC and comprises all Creditor Reporting System’s (CRS) codes in the 311, 312 and 313 series (agriculture, forestry and fishing). 
Rationale and Interpretation:
Total ODA and OOF to developing countries quantify the public effort (excluding export credits) that donors provide to developing countries for agriculture.
Data Sources and Collection Method
Donors have been reporting data to OECD’s CRS since 1973 with information on type of finance, type of aid, type of flow etc. In addition, such data on ODA can also be acquired from national administrations, national aid agency, ministry of foreign affairs or ministry of finances, from their annual statistical reports.
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
This indicator is calculated, using the data reported to the OECD’s Creditor Reporting System (CRS), as the sum of all ODA and OOF from all donors to developing countries in the agriculture sector. 
Comments and limitations:
Data in the Creditor Reporting System are available from 1973. However, the data coverage is considered complete since 1995 for commitments at an activity level and 2002 for disbursements. 
Proxy, alternative and additional indicators: N/A
Data Disaggregation
The data are available at an activity level and can therefore be disaggregated by donor, recipient, type of flow, type of aid, sector etc.  The sector level data can also be broken down into more granular levels (see http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/documentupload/CRS_BI_VOLUNTARY_purpose_codes2016flows_en_July17.pdf)
Indicator 2.b.1: Agricultural export subsidies
Target 2.b: Correct and prevent trade restrictions and distortions in world agricultural markets, including through the parallel elimination of all forms of agricultural export subsidies and all export measures with equivalent effect, in accordance with the mandate of the Doha Development Round
Goal 2: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
Agricultural export subsidies are defined in Article 1 paragraph (e) of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Agriculture. Members notify to the WTO export subsidies budgetary outlays and quantities of subsidized exports   in Tables ES:1 and supporting Tables ES:2. Budgetary outlays and quantities are expressed in a currency (national or other) and in quantity units as per Member's notification practices. The indicator reflects the budgetary outlays notified by WTO Members expressed in the same currency (US dollar). 
Concepts:
Export subsidies budgetary outlays are government policies/spending to encourage export of goods as opposed to domestic consumption through various forms of economic incentives. 
Table ES:1 and supporting table ES:2 constitute the notification formats to be used annually by WTO Members to report on their use of export subsidies as defined in document G/AG/2 dated 30 June 1995. 
Table ES:1 is to be used by WTO Members with export subsidies reduction commitments levels shown in their Schedule of Commitments. This table includes the level of export subsidies budgetary outlays and quantities of subsidized exports during the notification year for the various products or groups of products listed in the Member's Schedule of Commitments. 
Supporting table ES:2 is to be used by developing country Members making use of export subsidies pursuant to article 9 paragraph 4 of the Agreement on Agriculture. This table includes the level of export subsidies budgetary outlays and quantities of subsidized exports during the notification year for the corresponding products. 
These two tables cover all the agricultural export subsidies used by WTO Members and notified to the WTO.
Rationale and Interpretation:
The purpose of this indicator is to give detailed information on the level of export subsidies used annually per product or group of products, as notified by WTO Members. This indicator provides the sum of all the export subsidies budgetary outlays used and notified annually Member by Member, by broad categories of Members and globally.  
Agricultural export subsidies have the effect of lowering prices of exported agricultural goods. The amount of export subsidies budgetary outlays therefore constitutes an indicator of the degree of distortions generated by such measures. The reduction and removal of such subsidies reduce trade restrictions and distortions in world agricultural markets. 
Data Sources and Collection Method
The sources of data are WTO Members' notifications in their Table ES:1 and supporting table ES:2 notifications, pursuant to the notification requirements and formats adopted by the WTO Committee on Agriculture and contained in document G/AG/2. Country authorities that compile statistics on subsidies can provide data on this. 
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method: 
The indicator is calculated for all the Members with export subsidies reduction commitments levels shown in their Schedule of Commitments or having made use of export subsidies pursuant to article 9 paragraph 4 of the Agreement on Agriculture. 
The indicator is calculated for each Member by summing the export subsidies budgetary outlays for the various products or groups of products contained in their respective Table ES:1 and supporting Table ES:2 notifications. The conversion rate used to express these amounts in US dollar is the IMF yearly average exchange rate. 
The figures calculated for each Member are then summed together to calculate the indicator by broad categories of Members and globally. 
Comments and limitations:
The quality of the indicator depends on WTO Members' timeliness and accuracy of their notifications. 
Proxy, alternative and additional indicators: N/A
Data Disaggregation
Data could be disaggregated by categories of product or groups of products as notified by the WTO members. 
Indicator 2.c.1: Indicator of food price anomalies
Target 2.c: Adopt measures to ensure the proper functioning of food commodity markets and their derivatives and facilitate timely access to market information, including on food reserves, in order to help limit extreme food price volatility
Goal 2: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
The indicator of food price anomalies (IFPA) identifies abnormally high or low prices that occur for a food commodity price series over a period of time. The IFPA relies on a weighted compound growth rate(CGR) that accounts for both within year and across year price growth. 
Concepts: 
A food commodity price is the market valuation for a given unit of measure (kilogram, tonne, etc.) of a primary agricultural product that can be bought and sold, such as coarse grains or wheat. 
A compound growth rate (CGR) is a geometric mean that assumes a random variable grows at a steady rate, compounded over a specific period of time. Because it assumes a steady rate of growth the CGR smooths the effect of volatility of periodic price movements. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
Advance warning of impeding food crises emerging from abnormal growth in prices in global commodity markets can be critical to mitigating its impact. The food price surges in global markets in 2007-08 and 2011 are examples of this. Because prices summarize information held by a large number of economic agents, including their expectations regarding likely short-term developments in supply and demand, they are ideal to characterize the functioning of food commodity markets and may help to put in place policies that limit extreme price volatility. 
If the indicator is larger than or equal to 1, the price for a given commodity is said to be abnormally high; if it is less than 1 and larger than or equal to 0.5, prices are considered moderately high; and otherwise, said to be Normal. Values close to 1 and higher should be closely monitored as they may be the result of a market shock. These shocks may be a result of a drop in supplies due to adverse weather or even policy shocks, such as import or export bans. Demand side shocks may also be responsible. Given that the aim of Target 2.c is “to ensure the proper functioning of food commodity markets and their derivatives and facilitate timely access to market information, including on food reserves, in order to help limit extreme food price volatility”, the indicator can act as a potential bell weather and allow policy makers to adopt policies that would reduce the impact of any market shock. 
Data Sources and Collection Method
The data sources used for the calculation of the indicator are obtained from FAO’s Food Price Monitoring and Analysis Tool (FPMA-Tool) and FAOSTAT. The FPMA-Tool (http://www.fao.org/giews/food-prices/tool/public/#/home) compiles on a monthly basis 1 423 commodity price series in 90 countries. The commodity price data is obtained directly from national market information systems, national statistics institutes or ministries, or central banks. FAOSTAT compiles national data on the food CPI index for 150 countries on a monthly basis (http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/CP). The data in FAOSTAT is obtained from the IMF as reported by countries.
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
￼
Detailed information on the methodology can be found in the e-learning course titled: SDG Indicator 2.c.1 - Food price anomalies (http://www.fao.org/elearning/#/elc/en/course/SDG2C1). For more in depth understanding the methodological paper published by the Global Information Early Warning System (GIEWS) of FAO: http://www.fao.org/giews/food-  prices/research/detail/en/c/235685/ is also available.
Comments and limitations:
This indicator cannot be used, and is not suitable, for forecasting of future events. It is only able to characterize previous events. The indicator can only characterize price growth and cannot not isolate ex-post any changes in policy that may affect local price trends.
Proxy, alternative and additional indicators: N/A
Data Disaggregation
The IFPA can be disaggregated for a set of cereal commodities (wheat, rice, maize, sorghum/millet) that are critical for food consumption by country and market. The IFPA is also estimated using the food CPI index by country. This allows FAO to also characterize price movements of a complete and nationally defined food basket. Given granularity of the data, FAO can characterize the state of price volatility, and measure progress to reducing extreme shocks, at country, regional and global level.
SDG 2: Zero Hunger
It is time to rethink how we grow, share and consume our food. If done right, agriculture, forestry and fisheries can provide nutritious food for all and generate decent incomes, while supporting people-centered rural development and protecting the environment.
Right now, our soils, freshwater, oceans, forests and biodiversity are being rapidly degraded. Climate change is putting even more pressure on the resources we depend on, increasing risks associated with disasters, such as droughts and floods. Many rural women and men can no longer make ends meet on their land, forcing them to migrate to cities in search of opportunities. Poor food security is also causing millions of children to be stunted, or too short for the ages, due to severe malnutrition.
A profound change of the global food and agriculture system is needed if we are to nourish the 815 million people who are hungry today and the additional 2 billion people expected to be undernourished by 2050. Investments in agriculture are crucial to increasing the capacity for agricultural productivity and sustainable food production systems are necessary to help alleviate the perils of hunger.
Hunger
Globally, one in nine people in the world today (815 million) are undernourished
The majority of the worlds hungry people live in developing countries, where 12.9 per cent of the population is undernourished.
Asia is the continent with the hungriest people  two thirds of the total. The percentage in southern Asia has fallen in recent years but in western Asia it has increased slightly.
Southern Asia faces the greatest hunger burden, with about 281 million undernourished people. In sub-Saharan Africa, projections for the 2014-2016 period indicate a rate of undernourishment of almost 23 per cent.
Poor nutrition causes nearly half (45 per cent) of deaths in children under five  3.1 million children each year.
One in four of the worlds children suffer stunted growth. In developing countries, the proportion can rise to one in three.
66 million primary school-age children attend classes hungry across the developing world, with 23 million in Africa alone.
Food security

Agriculture is the single largest employer in the world, providing livelihoods for 40 per cent of todays global population. It is the largest source of income and jobs for poor rural households.
500 million small farms worldwide, most still rainfed, provide up to 80 per cent of food consumed in a large part of the developing world. Investing in smallholder women and men is an important way to increase food security and nutrition for the poorest, as well as food production for local and global markets.
Since the 1900s, some 75 per cent of crop diversity has been lost from farmers fields. Better use of agricultural biodiversity can contribute to more nutritious diets, enhanced livelihoods for farming communities and more resilient and sustainable farming systems.
If women farmers had the same access to resources as men, the number of hungry in the world could be reduced by up to 150 million.
4 billion people have no access to electricity worldwide  most of whom live in rural areas of the developing world. Energy poverty in many regions is a fundamental barrier to reducing hunger and ensuring that the world can produce enough food to meet future demand.
Goal 2 targets

2.1 end hunger and ensure access by all people, in particular the poor and people in vulnerable situations, including infants, to safe, nutritious and sufficient food all year round.

2.2 end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under 5 years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women and older persons.

2.3 double the agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers, in particular women, indigenous peoples, family farmers, pastoralists and fishers, including through secure and equal access to land, other productive resources and inputs, knowledge, financial services, markets and opportunities for value addition and non-farm employment.

2.4 ensure sustainable food production systems and implement resilient agricultural practices that increase productivity and production, that help maintain ecosystems, that strengthen capacity for adaptation to climate change, extreme weather, drought, flooding and other disasters and that progressively improve land and soil quality.
2.5 By 2020, maintain the genetic diversity of seeds, cultivated plants and farmed and domesticated animals and their related wild species, including through soundly managed and diversified seed and plant banks at the national, regional and international levels, and promote access to and fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge, as internationally agreed.

2.A Increase investment, including through enhanced international cooperation, in rural infrastructure, agricultural research and extension services, technology development and plant and livestock gene banks in order to enhance agricultural productive capacity in developing countries, in particular least developed countries.

2.B Correct and prevent trade restrictions and distortions in world agricultural markets, including through the parallel elimination of all forms of agricultural export subsidies and all export measures with equivalent effect, in accordance with the mandate of the Doha Development Round.

2.C Adopt measures to ensure the proper functioning of food commodity markets and their derivatives and facilitate timely access to market information, including on food reserves, in order to help limit extreme food price volatility.

Zero Hunger

A profound change of the global food and agriculture system is needed to nourish todays 795 million hungry + the additional 2 billion increase in global population expected by 2050
ZERO HUNGER: WHY IT MATTERS
To end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture
Extreme hunger and malnutrition remains a barrier to sustainable development and creates a trap from which people cannot easily escape. Hunger and malnutrition mean less productive individuals, who are more prone to disease and thus often unable to earn more and improve their livelihoods. There are nearly 800 million people who suffer from hunger worldwide, the vast majority in developing countries.
How many people go hungry?
New evidence continues to signal that the number of hungry people in the world is growing, reaching 821 million in 2017 or one in every nine people.
Hunger has been on the rise over the past three years, returning to levels from a decade ago. This reversal in progress sends a clear warning that more must be done and urgently if the Sustainable Development Goal of Zero Hunger is to be achieved by 2030.
The situation is worsening in South America and most regions of Africa. With enough food to feed everyone on the planet, why are there so many hungry people?
Poor harvesting practices, as well as food wastage have contributed to food scarcity. Wars have also had a negative impact on the availability of food and have led to a destruction of the environment, which is critical to grow food.
We all want our families to have enough food to eat that is safe and nutritious. A world with zero hunger can positively impact our economies, health, education, equality and social development. Its a key piece of building a better future for everyone. Additionally, with hunger limiting human development,
we will not be able to achieve the other sustainable development goals such as education, health and gender equality.
How much will it cost to achieve zero hunger?
We will need an estimated additional $267 billion per year on average to end world hunger by 2030. There will need to be investments in rural and urban areas and in social protection, so poor people have access to food and can improve their livelihoods.
You can make changes in your own lifeat home, at work and in the communityby supporting local farmers or markets and making sustainable food choices, supporting good nutrition for all, and fighting food waste.
You can also use your power as a consumer and voter, demanding businesses and governments make the choices and changes that will make Zero Hunger a reality. Join the conversation, whether on social media platforms or in your local communities.
You can join the Global Movement for Zero Hunger by joining the Zero Hunger Challenge to learn more, including more ways to take action!                                             


Goal 2. End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture
Goal 2 aims to end hunger and all forms of malnutrition by 2030. It also commits to universal access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food at all times of the year. This will require sustainable food production systems and resilient agricultural practices, equal access to land, technology and markets and international cooperation on investments in infrastructure and technology to boost agricultural productivity.The fight against hunger has progressed over the past 15 years. Globally, the prevalence of hunger has declined, from 15 per cent according to figures for 2000 to 2002, to 11 per cent according to figures for 2014 to 2016. However, more than 790 million people worldwide still lack regular access to adequate amounts of dietary energy. If current trends continue, the zero hunger target will be largely missed by 2030. Many countries that failed to reach the target set as part of the Millennium Development Goals, of halving the proportion of people who suffer from hunger, have faced natural and human-induced disasters or political instability, resulting in protracted crises, with increased vulnerability and food insecurity affecting large parts of the population. The persistence of hunger is no longer simply a matter of food availability. More and better data on access to food can enable the tracking of progress and guide interventions to fight food insecurity and malnutrition.Globally, in 2014, nearly 1 in 4 children under the age of 5, an estimated total of 159 million children, had stunted growth. Stunting is defined as inadequate height for age, an indicator of the cumulative effects of undernutrition and infection. Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa accounted for three quarters of the children under 5 with stunted growth in 2014. Another aspect of child malnutrition is the growing share of children who are overweight, a problem affecting nearly every region. Globally, between 2000 and 2014, the percentage of children under the age of 5 who were overweight grew from 5.1 per cent to 6.1 per cent. Ending hunger and malnutrition relies heavily on sustainable food production systems and resilient agricultural practices. Genetic diversity in livestock breeds is crucial for agriculture and food production since it allows for the raising of farm animals in a wide range of environments and provides the basis for diverse products and services. Globally, 20 per cent of local livestock breeds, meaning breeds reported in only one country, are at risk of extinction. Another 16 per cent of breeds are stable, and the status of the remaining local breeds is unknown owing to a lack of data. The figures exclude livestock breeds that have already become extinct. To increase the productive capacity of agriculture, more investment is needed, both public and private, from domestic and foreign sources. However, recent trends in government spending are not favourable. The agriculture orientation index, defined as agricultures share of government expenditures divided by the sectors share of gross domestic product (GDP), fell globally from 0.37 to 0.25 between 2001 and 2013. The decline in the index was interrupted only temporarily during the food price crisis of 2006 to 2008, when governments increased agricultural spending.Since the late 1990s, the percentage of aid for supporting agriculture in developing countries has been stable at around 8 per cent, when measured as a share of sector-allocable aid from member countries of the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). This has decreased, from a peak of 20 per cent in the mid-1980s, as a result of donors beginning to focus more on improving governance, building social capital and bolstering fragile States.One of the targets for Goal 2 calls for correcting and preventing distortions in world agricultural markets, including the elimination of all forms of agricultural export subsidies. Those subsidies mask market signals, reduce competitiveness and can lead to environmental damage and the inequitable distribution of benefits. That said, some progress is being made, with members of the World Trade Organization adopting a ministerial decision, in December 2015, on eliminating export subsidies for agricultural products and restraining export measures that have an equivalent effect. 
Goal 2. End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture 
Efforts to combat hunger and malnutrition have advanced significantly since 2000. Ending hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition for all, however, will require continued and focused efforts, especially in Asia and Africa. More investments in agriculture, including government spending and aid, are needed to increase capacity for agricultural productivity.
		The proportion of undernourished people worldwide declined from 15 per cent in 2000-2002 to 11 per cent in 2014-2016. About 793 million people are undernourished globally, down from 930 million people during the same period. 
		In 2016, an estimated 155 million children under 5 years of age were stunted (too short for their age, a result of chronic malnutrition). Globally, the stunting rate fell from 33 per cent in 2000 to 23 per cent in 2016. Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa accounted for three quarters of all stunted children that year. 
		In 2016, an estimated 52 million children under 5 years of age worldwide suffered from wasting (with a low weight for their height, usually the result of an acute and significant food shortage and/or disease). The global wasting rate in 2016 was 7.7 per cent, with the highest rate (15.4 per cent) in Southern Asia. At the other end of the spectrum, overweight and obesity affected 41 million children under 5 years of age worldwide (6 per cent) in 2016. 
		Ending hunger demands sustainable food production systems and resilient agricultural practices. One aspect of that effort is maintaining the genetic diversity of plants and animals, which is crucial for agriculture and food production. In 2016, 4.7 million samples of seeds and other plant genetic material for food and agriculture were preserved in 602 gene banks throughout 82 countries and 14 regional and international centres  a 2 per cent increase since 2014. Animal genetic material has been cryoconserved, but only for 15 per cent of national breed populations, according to information obtained from 128 countries. The stored genetic material is sufficient to reconstitute only 7 per cent of national breed populations should they become extinct. As of February 2017, 20 per cent of local breeds were classified as at risk. 
		Increased investments are needed to enhance capacity for agricultural productivity. However, the global agriculture orientation index  defined as agricultures share of government expenditure divided by the sectors share of gross domestic product (GDP)  fell from 0.38 in 2001 to 0.24 in 2013 and to 0.21 in 2015. 
		The share of sector-allocable aid allocated to agriculture from member countries of the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) fell from nearly 20 per cent in the mid-1980s to 7 per cent in the late 1990s, where it remained through 2015. The decline reflects a shift away from aid for financing infrastructure and production towards a greater focus on social sectors.
		In 2016, 21 countries experienced high or moderately high domestic prices, relative to their historic levels, for one or more staple cereal food commodities. Thirteen of those countries were in sub-Saharan Africa. The main causes of high prices were declines in domestic output, currency depreciation and insecurity. Localized increases in fuel prices also drove food prices higher.
		Some progress has been made in preventing distortions in world agricultural markets. The global agricultural export subsidies were reduced by 94 per cent from 2000 to 2014. In December 2015, members of the World Trade Organization adopted a ministerial decision on eliminating export subsidies for agricultural products and restraining export measures that have a similar effect. 




Goal 2. End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture
After a prolonged decline, world hunger appears to be on the rise again. Conflict, drought and disasters linked to climate change are among the key factors causing the reversal in the long-term progress in fighting global hunger, making the prospect of ending hunger and malnutrition by 2030 more difficult. It is estimated that the undernourishment rate increased to 11 per cent in 2016 from 10.6 per cent in 2015. This represents an increase, to 815 million, of undernourished people worldwide in 2016, up from 777 million in 2015. According to the Food Insecurity Experience Scale of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, which directly measures the difficulties faced by people in accessing food, in 2016, 689 million people in the world (9.3 per cent of the world population) reported experiencing severe food insecurity. Malnutrition manifests itself in various forms and has serious long-term consequences for the worlds children. While declining in almost every region, stunting (being too short for ones age) globally affected 22 per cent of children under 5 years of age  151 million children in 2017. Three quarters of these children lived in Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. In 2017, 51 million children under 5 years of age suffered from wasting  low weight for ones height  and 38 million were affected by obesity.Conserving the genetic diversity of plants and animals provides the basis for adapting livestock populations to future changes in environmental conditions or in the demand for products and services. At the end of 2017, global holdings of seed and other plant genetic materials conserved in 90 countries and 16 regional and international centres totalled 4.89 million samples, representing a 1 per cent increase over the previous year.Investments in agriculture are crucial to help improve the sectors productivity. However, government expenditure in the agricultural sector, measured by government expenditure in agriculture divided by the sectors share of gross domestic product (GDP), fell from 0.38 in 2001 to 0.23 in 2016 worldwide.Aid to agriculture in developing countries has fallen, from nearly 20 per cent of all donors sector-allocable aid in the mid-1980s to only 6 per cent, or $12.5 billion, in 2016.Progress has been made in reducing subsidies that distort the world agricultural markets. Agricultural export subsidies more than halved in 5 years, from $491 million in 2010 to less than $200 million in 2015.Volatility in food prices can have a negative impact on food security. In 2016, 26 countries experienced high or moderately high levels of general food prices, while in 21 countries, prices for one or more cereal products (maize, wheat, rice, sorghum/millet) were at high or moderately high levels. Sub-Saharan Africa had the largest number of countries, with high levels of both food prices and cereal prices. Declines in domestic output, currency depreciation and insecurity accounted for such high price levels.
