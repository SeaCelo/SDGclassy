Indicator 4.1.1: Proportion of children and young people (a) in Grades 2 /3; (b) at the end of primary; and (c) at the end of lower secondary achieving at least a minimum proficiency level in (i) reading and (ii) mathematics, by sex
Target 4.1: By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and effective learning outcomes
Goal 4: Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the percentage of children and young people who have achieved a minimum proficiency level in (i) reading and (ii) mathematics during primary (Grade 2 or 3) and at the end of primary and lower secondary education. 
Concepts:
Minimum proficiency level corresponds to the minimum set of skills or knowledge required for a given subject such as reading or mathematics.  Learning assessments are designed to measure a range of skill levels which are defined during the design of the assessment. As the assessment design can vary between national assessments and across international assessments ideally these benchmarks should to be aligned. Minimum proficiency levels for existing cross-national learning assessments have been provisionally adopted by the international community for interim reporting but in order to increase country coverage there is a need to achieve comparability across national and international assessments. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
The indicator is a direct measure of the minimum learning outcomes achieved in reading and mathematics during or at the end of the relevant stages of education. 
To create internationally comparable data, an international benchmark for minimum proficiency will need to be developed and adopted to address the variation in performance levels across national and cross-national assessments. This benchmark will divide learners into those who did not achieve the minimum proficiency and those who did. A value at or above the defined minimum proficiency score indicates that learners have achieved minimum proficiency levels in the required subject area.
Data Sources and Collection Method
Regional and international large-scale school-based learning assessments such as the Programme d'analyse des systèmes éducatifs de la CONFEMEN (PASEC), the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS), the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), the Southern and Eastern Africa Consortium for Monitoring Educational Quality (SACMEQ), the Tercer Estudio Regional Comparativo y Explicativo (TERCE) and the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), are good sources of data for this indicator. National learning assessments are another potential source. 
In order to extend coverage to include out-of-school children and youth, the UIS is developing a strategy to work with household surveys, including citizen-led assessments. This will require the mapping of the content being assessed to a common framework and ensuring minimum technical standards are observed such surveys.
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
Divide the total number of children and young people in a given stage of education n who have achieved the minimum proficiency level in a given subject s (mathematics or reading) by the total population in the given stage of education or relevant age group and multiply by 100. 
The formula is: 
￼
where,
MPt,n,s  is the number of  children and young people in the stage of education n, who have achieved or exceeded  the minimum proficiency level in subject s in school year t;
Pt,nis the total population in the stage of education n in school year t;
n denotes the grade or education level that was assessed; and
s denotes the subject (mathematics or reading). 
Comments and limitations:
Countries set their own standards so performance levels may not always be directly comparable. Furthermore, assessments most are typically administered within school systems. The current indicators cover only those individuals that are in school. The relative size of in-school target populations vary from country to country due to differences in the out-of-school populations. 
Assessing competencies of children and young people who are out-of-school would require household-based surveys, which may be very costly and difficult to administer. Such surveys are unlikely to be available on the scale needed within the next 3-5 years. Due to this, the initial focus is on assessing children that are in-school. The development of more coherent implementation plans to assess out-of-school children will require more time. 
There is only one threshold that divides children and young people in different stages of education into below minimum or at or above minimum proficiency levels:
(1) Below minimum level is the proportion of children and young people who do not achieve the minimum standard as established by countries; and
(2) At or above minimum level is the proportion of children and young people who have achieved at least the minimum standard. 
Due to the variation in performance level thresholds across countries, the national performance levels will have to be mapped to a globally defined minimum proficiency level. This mapping will allow for meaningful comparisons of performance across countries.

Data Disaggregation
This indicator is required to be disaggregated by sex and level or stage of education. It can be also disaggregated by age or age group, location, socio-economic status, migrant status, ethnicity and disability status. 
Indicator 4.2.2: Participation rate in organized learning (one year before the official primary entry age), by sex
Target 4.2: By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys have access to quality early childhood development, care and pre-primary education so that they are ready for primary education
Goal 4: Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the percentage of children aged one year younger than the official entry age to primary education who participate in one or more organized learning programmes, including programmes which offer a combination of education and care. Participants in early childhood education and primary education are both included. The age considered will vary by country depending on the official entry age to primary education. 
Concepts:
An organized learning programme is one which consists of a coherent set or sequence of educational activities designed with the intention of achieving pre-determined learning outcomes or the accomplishment of a specific set of educational tasks. Early childhood and primary education programmes are examples of organized learning programmes.  
Early childhood and primary education are defined in the 2011 revision of the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED 2011). Early childhood education is typically designed with a holistic approach to support children’s early cognitive, physical, social and emotional development and to introduce young children to organized instruction outside the family context. Primary education offers learning and educational activities designed to provide students with fundamental skills in reading, writing and mathematics, and establish a solid foundation for learning and understanding core areas of knowledge and personal development. It focuses on learning at a basic level of complexity with little, if any, specialisation.  
The official primary entry age is the age at which children are expected to start primary education according to national legislation or policies. Where more than one age are specified, for example, in different parts of a country, the most common official entry age (i.e. the age at which most children in the country are expected to start primary) is used for the calculation of this indicator. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
The indicator measures children’s exposure to organized learning activities in the year prior to the start of primary school as a representation of access to quality early childhood development, care and pre-primary education. 
A high value of the indicator shows a high degree of participation in organized learning immediately before the official entrance age to primary education.
Data Sources and Collection Method
This indicator can be calculated using administrative data from schools and other centres of organized learning combined with single year of age population estimates from population censuses and surveys. The data can also be acquired from nationally representative household surveys. 
Ministries of Education or National Statistical Offices are typical sources of such data. 
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
This indicator can be calculated by dividing the number of children participating in an organized learning programme who are one year younger than the official entry age to primary education by the population of the same age group and multiplying the result by 100. 
The participation rate,   of the age group a-1, is calculated as follows:
 ￼
where
￼is the number of children participating in early childhood or primary education (ISCED levels 0 or 1) who are aged one year below the official entry age a to primary education in reference year t 
￼ is the population who are one year younger than the official entry age a to primary education in reference year t 
Comments and limitations:
Participation in learning programmes in the early years is not full time for many children, meaning that exposure to learning environments outside of the home will vary in intensity. The indicator measures the percentage of children who are exposed to organized learning but not the intensity or quality of the programme. More work is needed to ensure that the definition of learning programmes is consistent across various surveys and defined in a manner that is easily understood by survey respondents, ideally with complementary information collected on the amount of time children spend in learning programmes. 
Nationally-published figures may differ from the international ones because of differences between national education systems and the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED), differences in coverage (i.e. the extent to which different types of education – e.g. private or special education – are included in one rather than the other) and/or between national and the United Nations Population Division population estimates. 
Proxy, alternative and additional indicators:
Other indicators which measure participation in organized learning at young ages include net and gross enrolment rates in early childhood, pre-primary and primary education and age specific enrolment rates. 
Data Disaggregation
This indicator is required to be disaggregated by sex. It can also be disaggregated by sex, location, income and disability status.
Indicator 4.3.1: Participation rate of youth and adults in formal and non-formal education and training in the previous 12 months, by sex
Target 4.3: By 2030, ensure equal access for all women and men to affordable and quality technical, vocational and tertiary education, including university
Goal 4: Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the percentage of youth and adults in a given age range (e.g. 15-24 years, 25-64 years, etc.) participating in formal or non-formal education or training in a given time period (e.g. last 12 months) 
Concepts:
Formal education and training is defined as education provided by the system of schools, colleges, universities and other formal educational institutions that normally constitutes a continuous ‘ladder’ of full-time education for children and young people, generally beginning at the age of 5 to 7 and continuing to up to 20 or 25 years old. In some countries, the upper parts of this ‘ladder’ are organized programmes of joint part-time employment and part-time participation in the regular school and university system. 
Non-formal education and training is defined as any organized and sustained learning activities that do not correspond exactly to the above definition of formal education. Non-formal education may therefore take place both within and outside educational institutions and cater to people of all ages. Depending on national contexts, it may cover educational programmes to impart adult literacy, life-skills, work-skills, and general culture. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
This indicator shows the level of participation of youth and adults in education and training of all types, as a representation of access to affordable and quality training. 
A high value indicates a large share of the population in the relevant age group has access to and takes part  in formal and non-formal education and training.
Data Sources and Collection Method
This indicator can be calculated using administrative data from schools and other places of education and training or data from household or other sample surveys on participants in formal and non-formal education and training by single year of age or broader age groups (e.g. 5- or 10-year age groups); population censuses and surveys are sources for population estimates by single year of age or age group (if using administrative data on participation). Ministries of Education or National Statistical Offices are typical sources of such data. 
Eurostat’s Adult Education Survey (AES) and OECD’s Survey of Adult Skills in its Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) both of which are household surveys are good sources of data for this indicator. Eurostat’s Continuing Vocational Training Survey (CVTS) collects data on participation in work-related education and training from enterprises. 
Labour Force Surveys (LFS) can also serve as a source of data for participation in education and training though often the reference period in which participation should be reported is four weeks rather than 12 months. 
More work is being undertaken to review existing national household surveys to see if they can be suitable sources for this indicator. A possible module for inclusion in national sample surveys is being developed by the Working Group on Indicator Development of UNESCO’s Technical Cooperation Group on SDG-Education 2030 Indicators. 
National authorities who are already developing new surveys or modules to collect these data can refer to use Eurostat’s Adult Education Survey or the OECD’s Survey of Adult Skills as possible templates.
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method: 
This indicator is calculated by dividing the total number of people in a given age group, a, who participated in formal and non-formal education and training in the given reference period by the population of the same age group and multiplying the result by 100. 
The participation rate,   of the age group a in year t, is calculated as follows: 
￼
where
   ￼   is the number of people in age group a who participated in formal and non-formal education and training in the given reference period in year t 
    ￼ is the population in age group a in year t 
Comments and limitations:
Formal and non-formal education and training can be offered in a variety of settings including schools and universities, workplace environments and others, and can have a variety of durations. Administrative data often capture only provision in formal settings such as schools and universities. Participation rates do not capture the intensity or quality of the provision nor the outcomes of the education and training on offer. 
Proxy, alternative and additional indicators:
Although the preferred reference period for this indicator is education and training undertaken in a 12-month period, many surveys are available which capture data for a shorter period. Such sources, suitably footnoted, may be used where the preferred indicator is not available.
Data Disaggregation
This indicator is required to be disaggregated by sex. It can be also disaggregated by age, location, income and disability status. It may also be disaggregated by type of education or training.
Indicator 4.4.1: Proportion of youth and adults with information and communications technology (ICT) skills, by type of skill
Target 4.4: By 2030, substantially increase the number of youth and adults who have relevant skills, including technical and vocational skills, for employment, decent jobs and entrepreneurship
Goal 4: Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the percentage of youth (aged 15-24 years) and adults (aged 15 years and above) that have undertaken certain computer-related activities in a given time period (e.g. last three months). 
Concepts:
Computer-related activities to measure ICT skills include:
	1.	Copying or moving a file or folder
	2.	Using copy and paste tools to duplicate or move information within a document
	3.	Sending e-mails with attached files (e.g. document, picture, and video)
	4.	Using basic arithmetic formulae in a spreadsheet
	5.	Connecting and installing new devices (e.g. modem, camera, printer)
	6.	Finding, downloading, installing and configuring software
	7.	Creating electronic presentations with presentation software (including text, images, sound, video or charts)
	8.	Transferring files between a computer and other devices
	9.	Writing a computer program using a specialised programming language 
A computer refers to a desktop computer, a laptop (portable) computer or a tablet (or similar handheld computer). It does not include equipment with some embedded computing abilities, such as smart TV sets or cell phones. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
ICT skills determine the effective use of information and communication technology. The lack of such skills continues to be one of the key barriers keeping people, in particular women, from fully benefitting from the potential of information and communication technologies. This indicator makes the link between ICT usage and impact and helps measure and track the level of proficiency of users. A high value indicates that a large share of the reference population has the ICT skill being measured.
Data Sources and Collection Method
Ministry of education, national statistical offices and other data providers would be required to conduct household surveys or learning assessment such as Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), to collect information for calculation of this indicator. In some cases, surveying the schools which maintain administrative data on ICT skills of students can also be a valid source. For cross-national purposes, data providers include Eurostat and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
The indicator,  ,is calculated as follows:
 ￼
where,
PICTS is the percentage of people in age group a who have ICT skill s
ICTa,sis the number of people in age group a who have ICT skill s;
Pais the population in age group a; and
s denotes one of the listed 9 ICT skills. 
The indicator is calculated as the percentage of people in a given population who have responded ‘yes’ to a selected number of variables e.g. the use of ICT skills in various subject areas or learning domains, the use of ICT skills inside or outside of school and/or workplace, the minimum amount of time spent using ICT skills inside and outside of school and/or workplace, availability of internet access inside or outside of school and/or workplace, etc. 
Comments and limitations:
The indicator is based on the responses provided by interviewees regarding certain computer-related activities that they have carried out in a reference period of time. However, it is not a direct assessment of skills nor of the effectiveness of how those activities were conducted.
This indicator is relatively new but based on an internationally-agreed definition and methodology, which have been developed under the coordination of International Telecommunications Union (ITU), through its Expert Groups and following an extensive consultation process with countries. It is also one of the Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development’s Core List of Indicators, which was endorsed by the UN Statistical Commission in 2014. 
Proxy, alternative and additional indicators: N/A
Data Disaggregation
This indicator is required to be disaggregated by type of skill.  Therefore, this indicator should be calculated for each of the 9 ICT skills separately using the number of respondents that have responded ‘yes’ to questions on each skill. This indicator can also be disaggregated by age or age-group of students, sex, location and socio-economic status if collected in the relevant survey.
Indicator 4.5.1: Parity indices (female/male, rural/urban, bottom/top wealth quintile and others such as disability status, indigenous peoples and conflict-affected, as data become available) for all education indicators on this list that can be disaggregated
Target 4.5: By 2030, eliminate gender disparities in education and ensure equal access to all levels of education and vocational training for the vulnerable, including persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples and children in vulnerable situations
Goal 4: Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the ratio of the value of the underlying indicator (e.g. 4.1.1) for one sub-group to that of another. Typically, the value for the likely more disadvantaged group is the numerator. A value of exactly 1 indicates parity between the two groups although, for analytical purposes, values between 0.97 and 1.03 are typically assumed to be at parity. 
Parity indices can be calculated for the following SDG 4 global indicators:
	•	4.1.1
	•	4.2.1
	•	4.2.2
	•	4.3.1
	•	4.4.1
	•	4.6.1
	•	4.c.1 
Concepts:
See metadata for relevant underlying indicator. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
Parity indices are used to measure relative disparity between two sub-populations of interest with regard to a given indicator.
In the context of this indicator, the indices highlight the relative differences between two population sub-groups of interest. For example, a parity index for indicator 4.4.1, could provide insights into the differences between men and women (or any other dimension of interest) in ICT skills. 
The further from the range 0.97 and 1.03 the parity index lies, the greater the disparity between the two groups of interest.
Data Sources and Collection Method
Data source is the same as the underlying indicator for which this parity measure is being calculated.
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
This indicator can be calculated by dividing a given indicator for the dimension of interest (sex, wealth, location, etc.) for the likely more disadvantaged group (female, poorest quintile, rural, etc.), INDi,d, by the value for the likely more advantaged group (male, richest quintile, urban, etc.), INDi,a. 
The parity index for a given dimension (sex, wealth, location, etc.), DPI, for any indicator is given as follows: 
￼
where 
INDit is the Education 2030 (SDG 4) indicator i for which an equity measure is needed;
d is the likely more disadvantaged group (eg. female, poorest, rural, etc.); and
a is the likely more advantaged group (eg. male, richest, urban, etc.). 
Comments and limitations:
The indicator can be adjusted to be symmetrical about 1 and limited to a range between 0 and 2 through a simple transformation by inverting ratios that exceed 1 and subtracting them from 2. 
Proxy, alternative and additional indicators: N/A
Data Disaggregation
Parity indices can be calculated for any sub-group of interest for which sufficient data are available taking account of sample sizes and standard errors. 
Indicator 4.6.1: Proportion of population in a given age group achieving at least a fixed level of proficiency in functional (a) literacy and (b) numeracy skills, by sex
Target 4.6: By 2030, ensure that all youth and a substantial proportion of adults, both men and women, achieve literacy and numeracy
Goal 4: Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the proportion of youth (aged 15-24 years) and of adults (aged 15 years and above) who have achieved or exceeded a given level of proficiency in (a) literacy and (b) numeracy. The fixed or minimum level of proficiency is measured relative to literacy and numeracy scales defined according to national, regional and international learning assessments. 
Concepts:
The fixed level of proficiency is the benchmark of basic knowledge in a domain (literacy or numeracy) measured through learning assessments. Currently, there are no common standards to determine the fixed level of proficiency that have been validated by the international community or countries. 
The concepts of functional literacy and numeracy are based on the UNESCO definition which covers a continuum of proficiency levels rather than a dichotomy. A person is functionally literate who can engage in all those activities in which literacy is required for effective functioning of their group and community and also for enabling them to continue to use reading, writing and calculation for their own and the community’s development. The assessment of functional literacy and numeracy should cover various proficiency levels ranging from a low level to the mastery of the requisite domain. 
Rationale and Interpretation: 
The indicator is a direct measure of the functional proficiency of youth and adults in literacy and numeracy which divides youth and adults into those who have achieved the requisite fixed level of proficiency and those who have not. 
(1) Below the fixed proficiency level is the proportion of youth and adults who have not achieved the minimum proficiency level as established by countries according to the global competency or skills framework. 
(2) At or above the fixed proficiency level is the proportion of youth and adults who have achieved at least the minimum proficiency level.
Due to the heterogeneity of performance levels set by national and cross-national assessments, these performance levels will be based on a global competency or skills framework. Once the performance levels are established, the global education community will be able to identify for each country the proportion of youth and adults who achieved at least minimum proficiency level.
Data Sources and Collection Method
This indicator is collected via skills’ assessment surveys of the youth and adult populations. OECD’s Survey of Adult Skills in its Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC), the World Bank’s Skills Towards Employment and Productivity (STEP) measurement programme, and the UIS’s Literacy Assessment and Monitoring Programme (LAMP), all of which are household surveys, are good sources of data for this indicator.  A new Short Literacy Survey (SLS) based on LAMP has recently been developed to offer a less costly and technically demanding option for countries. National surveys of adult literacy and numeracy skills may be additional sources. 
Only PIAAC measures both literacy and numeracy skills. STEP and the newly developed SLS only measure literacy. Both PIAAC and STEP can be put on a common scale as they are linked psychometrically by design.
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
This indicator can be calculated by dividing the number of persons aged 15-24 years or 15 years and above achieving at least the minimum fixed level of proficiency in a large-scale representative assessment survey on literacy and/or numeracy, , by the total number of participants of the same age-group who participated in the assessment. 
The proportion of youth and adults who have achieved at least the minimum threshold of proficiency, PMINta,s of the age group a in reference year t, is calculated as follows: 
￼
where
Pta,s is the number of youth or adults in age group a who have achieved at least the minimum proficiency level in domain s in reference year t 
POPta,s is the total number of youth or adults in age group a who participated in the assessment of domain s in reference year t
s  denotes the domain whether literacy or numeracy  
Comments and limitations:
The measurement of youth and adult proficiencies in literacy and numeracy requires some form of direct assessment. Using household surveys to measure learning can be costly and difficult to administer and may underestimate learning in areas that are critical to daily life but are harder to assess in standardised approaches. The result may be inaccurate representations of what youth and adults know and can do, especially in relation to applying skills that may vary across contexts.

Indicator 4.a.1: Proportion of schools with access to: (a) electricity; (b) the Internet for pedagogical purposes; (c) computers for pedagogical purposes; (d) adapted infrastructure and materials for students with disabilities; (e) basic drinking water; (f) single-sex basic sanitation facilities; and (g) basic handwashing facilities (as per the WASH indicator definitions)
Target 4.a: Build and upgrade education facilities that are child, disability and gender sensitive and provide safe, non-violent, inclusive and effective learning environments for all
Goal 4: Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all 
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
The indicator is defined as the percentage of schools by level of education (primary, lower secondary and upper secondary education) with access to the following facilities: 
(a) Electricity; (b) the Internet for pedagogical purposes; (c) computers for pedagogical purposes; (d) adapted infrastructure and materials for students with disabilities; (e) basic drinking water; (f) single-sex basic sanitation facilities; and (g) basic handwashing facilities. 
Concepts: 
Electricity means regularly and readily available sources of power (e.g. grid/mains connection, wind, water, solar and fuel-powered generator, etc.) that enable the adequate and sustainable use of ICT infrastructure for educational purposes. 
Internet access for pedagogical purposes refers to the use of the Internet to deliver instructional materials on a computer or through other devices, in accordance with learners’ pedagogical needs. Access implies that the Internet is available for enhancing teaching and learning and is accessible by pupils. Internet is defined as a worldwide interconnected computer network, which provides pupils access to a number of communication services including the World Wide Web and carries e-mail, news, entertainment and data files, irrespective of the device used (i.e. not assumed to be only via a computer and thus can also be accessed by mobile telephone, tablet, PDA, games machine, digital TV etc.). Access can be via a fixed narrowband, fixed broadband, or via mobile network. 
Computers for pedagogical purposes implies the use of computers to support course delivery or independent teaching and learning needs. This may include activities using computers to meet information needs for research purposes, develop presentations, perform hands-on exercises and experiments, share information, and participate in online discussion forums for educational purposes. It includes a desktop computer, a laptop computer and a tablet. 
Adapted infrastructure is defined as any built environment related to education facilities that are accessible to all users, including those with different types of disability, to be able to gain access to use and exit from them. Accessibility includes ease of independent approach, entry, evacuation and/or use of a building and its services and facilities (such as water and sanitation), by all the building's potential users with an assurance of individual health, safety and welfare during the course of those activities. 
Adapted materials include learning materials and assistive products that enable students and teachers with disabilities/functioning limitations to access learning and to participate fully in the school environment. 
Accessible learning materials include textbooks, instructional materials, assessments and other materials that are available and provided in appropriate formats such as audio, braille, sign language and simplified formats that can be used by students and teachers with disabilities/functioning limitations. 
Basic drinking water is defined as a functional drinking water source (MDG ‘improved’ categories) on or near the premises and water points accessible to all users during school hours. 
Single-sex basic sanitation facilities are defined as functional sanitation facilities (MDG ‘improved’ categories) separated for males and females on or near the premises. 
Basic handwashing facilities are defined as functional handwashing facilities, with soap and water available to all girls and boys. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
This indicator reflects the level of access in schools to key basic services and facilities that are necessary to ensure a safe and effective learning environment for all students. 
A high value indicates that schools have good access to the relevant services and facilities. Ideally, each school should have access to all these services and facilities. 
Data Sources and Collection Method
The data required to calculate this indicator are available through administrative records from schools and other providers of education and training. 
Ministries of Education or National Statistical Offices are typical sources of such data.
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method: 
Divide the number of schools with access to the relevant facility in each level of education by the total number of schools for the same level of education and multiply the result by 100. 
The indicator, PSn,f at the level n of education with access to facility f is defined as follows:
￼
here 
Stn,f is the number of schools at level n of education with access to facility f in reference year t
Stnis the total number of schools at the level n of education in reference year t 
Comments and Limitations:
Nationally-published figures may differ from the international ones because of differences between national education systems and the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED), or differences in coverage (i.e. the extent to which different types of education – e.g. private or special education – are included in one rather than the other). 
The indicator measures the existence in schools of the given service or facility but not its quality or operational state. 
Proxy, alternative and additional indicators: N/A

Indicator 4.b.1: Volume of official development assistance flows for scholarships by sector and type of study
Target 4.b: By 2020, substantially expand globally the number of scholarships available to developing countries, in particular least developed countries, small island developing States and African countries, for enrolment in higher education, including vocational training and information and communications technology, technical, engineering and scientific programmes, in developed countries and other developing countries
Goal 4: Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
The indicator is defined as the gross disbursements of total Official Development Assistance (ODA) from all donors for scholarships.
Concepts:
The Development Assistance Committee (DAC) defines ODA as those flows to countries and territories on the DAC list of ODA recipients and multilateral institutions which are:
(1)    Provided by official agencies, including state and local governments, or by their executive agencies; and
(2)    Each transaction of which:
a. is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; and
b. is concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25 percent (calculated at a rate of discount of 10%). 
Scholarships are financial aid awards for individual students and contributions to trainees. The beneficiary students and trainees are nationals of developing countries. Financial aid awards include bilateral grants to students registered for systematic instruction in private or public institutions of higher education to follow full-time studies or training courses in the donor country. Estimated tuition costs of students attending schools financed by the donor but not receiving individual grants are not included here, but under item imputed student costs (CRS type of aid E01). Training costs relate to contributions for trainees from developing countries receiving mainly non-academic, practical or vocational training in the donor country. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
Total ODA flows to developing countries quantify the global public effort that donors provide to developing countries as educational scholarships.
Data Sources and Collection Method
The OECD/DAC has been collecting data on official and private resource flows from 1960 at an aggregate level and 1973 at an activity level through the CRS (CRS data are considered complete from 1995 for commitments at an activity level and 2002 for disbursements). 
A statistical reporter is responsible for the collection of DAC statistics in each providing country/agency. This reporter is usually located in the national aid agency, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or Finance etc. 
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
This indicator is calculated as the sum of all ODA flows from all donors to developing countries in the form of scholarships, as reported to the OECD’s Creditor Reporting System (CRS) by donor countries.   
Comments and limitations:
DAC statistics are standardized on a calendar year basis for all donors and may differ from fiscal year data available in budget documents for some countries. 
Data in the Creditor Reporting System are available from 1973. However, the data coverage is considered complete from 1995 for commitments at an activity level and 2002 for disbursements. Data for scholarships are only available since 2010 when the new typology of aid was introduced in DAC statistics.

The data are available at an activity level and can therefore be disaggregated by donor, recipient, type of flow, sector etc. (see http://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/dacandcrscodelists.htm).
Indicator 4.c.1: Proportion of teachers in: (a) pre-primary; (b) primary; (c) lower secondary; and (d) upper secondary education who have received at least the minimum organized teacher training (e.g. pedagogical training) pre-service or in-service required for teaching at the relevant level in a given country
Target 4.c: By 2030, substantially increase the supply of qualified teachers, including through international cooperation for teacher training in developing countries, especially least developed countries and small island developing States
Goal 4: Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all 
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the percentage of teachers by level of education taught (pre-primary, primary, lower secondary and upper secondary education) who have received at least the minimum organized pedagogical teacher training pre-service and in-service required for teaching at the relevant level in a given country. 
Concepts:
A teacher is trained if they have received at least the minimum organized pedagogical teacher training pre-service and in-service required for teaching at the relevant level in each country. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
Teachers play a key role in ensuring the quality of education provided. Ideally all teachers should receive adequate, appropriate and relevant pedagogical training to teach at the chosen level of education and be academically well-qualified in the subject(s) they are expected to teach. This indicator measures the share of the teaching work force which is pedagogically well-trained. 
A high value indicates that most students are being taught by teachers who are pedagogically well-trained to teach.
Data Sources and Collection Method
The data for this indicator come from administrative data from schools and other organized learning centres. 
Ministries of Education and National Statistical Offices are typical sources of such data. 
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
This indicator is calculated by dividing the number of trained teachers at each level of education by the total number of teachers at the same level and multiplying the result by 100. 
The percentage of trained teachers for each level of education (n), who are trained or have a minimum level of organized teacher training, PTTn is calculated as follows: 
￼
where 
           TTtn is the number of trained teachers at level n of education in reference year t
          Ttn is the total number of teachers at level n of education in reference year t 
Comments and limitations:
National minimum training requirements can vary widely from one country to the next. This variability between countries lessens the usefulness of global tracking because the indicator would only show the percent reaching national standards, not whether teachers in different countries have similar levels of training. Further work would be required if a common standard for teacher training is to be applied across countries.

Data Disaggregation
This indicator can be disaggregated by sex, level of education, type of institution (public/private) and by location (urban/rural).
SDG 4: Education
Obtaining a quality education is the foundation to creating sustainable development. In addition to improving quality of life, access to inclusive education can help equip locals with the tools required to develop innovative solutions to the worlds greatest problems.

Over 265 million children are currently out of school and 22% of them are of primary school age. Additionally, even the children who are attending schools are lacking basic skills in reading and math. In the past decade, major progress has been made towards increasing access to education at all levels and increasing enrollment rates in schools particularly for women and girls. Basic literacy skills have improved tremendously, yet bolder efforts are needed to make even greater strides for achieving universal education goals. For example, the world has achieved equality in primary education between girls and boys, but few countries have achieved that target at all levels of education.

The reasons for lack of quality education are due to lack of adequately trained teachers, poor conditions of schools and equity issues related to opportunities provided to rural children. For quality education to be provided to the children of impoverished families, investment is needed in educational scholarships, teacher training workshops, school building and improvement of water and electricity access to schools.

Enrolment in primary education in developing countries has reached 91 per cent but 57 million primary age children remain out of school.
More than half of children that have not enrolled in school live in sub-Saharan Africa.
An estimated 50 per cent of out-of-school children of primary school age live in conflict-affected areas.
617 million youth worldwide lack basic mathematics and literacy skills.
Goal 4 targets

ensure that all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and Goal-4 effective learning outcomes ensure that all girls and boys have access to quality early childhood development, care and preprimary education so that they are ready for primary education ensure equal access for all women and men to affordable and quality technical, vocational and tertiary education, including university substantially increase the number of youth and adults who have relevant skills, including technical and vocational skills, for employment, decent jobs and entrepreneurship eliminate gender disparities in education and ensure equal access to all levels of education and vocational training for the vulnerable, including persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples and children in vulnerable situations ensure that all youth and a substantial proportion of adults, both men and women, achieve literacy and numeracy ensure that all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development, including, among others, through education for sustainable development and sustainable lifestyles, human rights, gender equality, promotion of a culture of peace and non-violence, global citizenship and appreciation of cultural diversity and of cultures contribution to sustainable development
Build and upgrade education facilities that are child, disability and gender sensitive and provide safe, nonviolent, inclusive and effective learning environments for all
By 2020, substantially expand globally the number of scholarships available to developing countries, in particular least developed countries, small island developing States and African countries, for enrolment in higher education, including vocational training and information and communications technology, technical, engineering and scientific programmes, in developed countries and other developing countries substantially increase the supply of qualified teachers, including through international cooperation for teacher training in developing countries, especially least developed countries and small island developing states

                        While enrolment in primary education in developing countries has reached 91 per cent, 57 million children remain out of school
QUALITY EDUCATION: WHY IT MATTERS
Ensure inclusive and quality education for all and promote lifelong learning.
Why does education matter?
Education is the key that will allow many other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be achieved. When people are able to get quality education they can break from the cycle of poverty. Education therefore helps to reduce inequalities and to reach gender equality. It also empowers people everywhere to live more healthy and sustainable lives. Education is also crucial to fostering tolerance between people and contributes to more peaceful societies.
So through education, people can get better jobs and have better lives?
education reduces inequality. Using data for 114 countries in the 1985-2005 period, one extra year of education is associated with a reduction of the Gini coefficient by 1.4 percentage points.
But hasnt a lot of progress been made over the last few years on education?
 enrolment in primary education in developing countries has reached 91%. According to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS Data Centre), since 2000, the percentage of out-ofschool children among primary-school-age children has declined from 40% to 22% in sub-Saharan Africa and from 20% to 6% in South Asia.
Where are people struggling the most to have access to education?
More than half of children that have not enrolled in school live in sub-Saharan Africa, which makes it the region with the largest number of out-of-school children in the world. And this region has a very young population so it will have to provide basic education to 444 million children between the ages of 3 and 15 in 2030, which is 2.6 times the numbers enrolled today.
Are there groups that have a more difficult access to education?
women and girls are one of these groups. About one-third of countries in the developing regions have not achieved gender parity in primary education.
In sub-Saharan Africa, Oceania and Western Asia, girls still face barriers to entering both primary and secondary school. These disadvantages in education also translate into lack of access to skills and limited opportunities in the labour market for young women.
Ask our governments to place education as a priority in both policy and practice.
Lobby our governments to make firm commitments to provide free primary school education to all, including vulnerable or marginalized groups.
Encourage the private sector to invest resources in the development of educational tools and facilities
Urge NGOs to partner with youth and other groups to foster the importance of education within local communities
                                         







Goal 4. Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong opportunities for all
Despite progress, the world failed to meet the Millennium Development Goal of achieving universal primary education by 2015. In 2013, the latest year for which data are available, 59 million children of primary-school age were out of school. Estimates show that, among those 59 million children, 1 in 5 of those children had dropped out and recent trends suggest that 2 in 5 of out-of-school children will never set foot in a classroom. The Sustainable Development Goals clearly recognize that this gap must be closed, even as the international community more explicitly addresses the challenges of quality and equity.Measuring learning achievement, starting in the early grades, will help to identify where schools are failing to meet their commitments to children and to formulate appropriate remedial action. For example, data for 2013 from 15 Latin American countries show that in six countries, fewer than 50 per cent of third graders had a minimum level of proficiency in mathematics; in three countries, fewer than half were proficient in reading. At the end of primary school, children should be able to read and write and to understand and use basic concepts in mathematics. However, in 2014, between  40 per cent and 90 per cent of children failed to achieve even minimum levels of proficiency in reading, in 10 African countries, and in nine of those countries, between 40 per cent and 90 per cent of children failed to achieve minimum levels of proficiency in mathematics.The end of lower secondary education often coincides with the end of compulsory education. By this stage, young people should be able to master subject-related knowledge and skills and possess personal and social skills. Data from  38 countries in the developed regions show that, in the majority of those countries, at least 75 per cent of young people achieved at least a minimum proficiency in reading and/or mathematics; the same was true for only 5 out of 22 countries, in developing regions, for which data were available. Completion rates for both primary and lower secondary education has been rising steadily since 2000. Completion rates for primary education in both developed and developing regions exceeded 90 per cent in 2013. At the lower secondary level, the gap between developed and developing regions has narrowed substantially, but still stood at nearly 20 percentage points in 2013 (91 per cent for developed regions and 72 per cent for developing regions). Quality early education provides children with basic cognitive and language skills and fosters emotional development. In the majority of the 58 countries with available data for the period 2009-2015, more than half of children between the ages of 3 and 4 were developmentally on track in at least three of the following domains: literacy, numeracy, physical development, social-emotional development and learning. Goal 4 strongly supports the reduction of persistent disparities. Worldwide, in 2013, two thirds of the 757 million adults (aged 15 and over) who were unable to read and write were women. Globally, in 2013, 1 in 10 girls were out of school, compared to 1 in 12 boys. Children from the poorest 20 per cent of households are nearly four times more likely to be out of school than their richest peers. Out-of-school rates are also higher in rural areas and among children from households headed by someone with less than a primary education. To fulfil the promise of universal primary and secondary education, new primary school teachers are needed, with current estimates showing a need for nearly 26 million of them by 2030. Africa faces the greatest challenges in this regard, with nearly 7 in 10 countries experiencing acute shortages of trained primary school teachers. In 2013, only 71 per cent of teachers in sub-Saharan Africa and 84 per cent in Northern Africa were trained in accordance with national standards. Official development assistance for educational scholarships amounted to around $1.1 billion annually from 2011 to 2013. It totalled $1.2 billion in 2014, with Australia, France and Japan being the largest contributors. 
Goal 4. Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all 
Achieving inclusive and equitable quality education for all will require increasing efforts, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia and for vulnerable populations, including persons with disabilities, indigenous people, refugee children and poor children in rural areas. 
		In 2014, about 2 in 3 children worldwide participated in pre-primary or primary education in the year prior to official entry age for primary school. However, in the least developed countries, the ratio was only 4 in 10. 
		Despite considerable gains in education enrolment over the past 15 years, worldwide, the adjusted net enrolment rates were 91 per cent for primary education, 84 per cent for lower secondary education and 63 per cent for upper secondary education in 2014. About 263 million children and youth were out of school, including 61 million children of primary school age. Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia account for over 70 per cent of the global out-of-school population in primary and secondary education. 
		Even though more children than ever are going to school, many do not acquire basic skills in reading and mathematics. Recent learning assessment studies show that in 9 of 24 sub-Saharan African countries and 6 of 15 Latin American countries with data, fewer than half of the students at the end of primary education had attained minimum proficiency levels in mathematics. In 6 of 24 sub-Saharan African countries with data, fewer than half of the students who finished their primary schooling had attained minimum proficiency levels in reading.
		Equity issues constitute a major challenge in education according to a recent assessment. In all countries with data, children from the richest 20 per cent of households achieved greater proficiency in reading at the end of their primary and lower secondary education than children from the poorest 20 per cent of households. In most countries with data, urban children scored higher in reading than rural children.
		The lack of trained teachers and the poor condition of schools in many parts of the world are jeopardizing prospects for quality education for all. Sub-Saharan Africa has a relatively low percentage of trained teachers in pre-primary, primary and secondary education (44 per cent, 74 per cent and 55 per cent, respectively). Moreover, the majority of schools in the region do not have access to electricity or potable water.
		On the basis of data from 65 developing countries, the average percentage of schools with access to computers and the Internet for teaching purposes is above 60 per cent in both primary and secondary education. However, the share is less than 40 per cent in more than half of sub-Saharan countries with data. 
		Official development assistance (ODA) for scholarships amounted to $1billion in 2015, a decrease from $1.2 billion in 2014. Australia, France and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland were the largest contributors.


Goal 4. Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all
Critical efforts are needed to improve the quality of education. Disparities in education along the lines of gender, urban/rural location and other dimensions still run deep, and more investments in education infrastructure are required, particularly in the least developed countries.In 66 countries with comparable data for the period 20092017, around two in three children aged 3 and 4 were developmentally on track in at least three of the following domains: literacy-numeracy, physical development, social-emotional development and learning.At the global level, the participation rate in early childhood and primary education was 70 per cent in 2016, up from 63 per cent in 2010, with considerable variation across countries and regions: the lowest rates were in sub-Saharan Africa (41 per cent) and Northern Africa and Western Asia (52 per cent).It is estimated that 617 million, or 58 per cent, of children and adolescents of primary and lower secondary school age worldwide are not achieving minimum proficiency levels in reading and mathematics. About two thirds of them attend school but are not learning, either because they drop out or because they do not learn the basics.Disparities based on location and wealth generally favour the urban and the rich. For example, according to data from 62 countries for 20012015, only 12 countries show parity between urban and rural children in achieving minimum proficiency levels in reading or mathematics at the end of primary education.The least developed countries face the biggest challenges in providing schools with basic infrastructure. In 2016, only 34 per cent of primary schools in the least developed countries had electricity and less than 40 per cent were equipped with basic handwashing facilities. In sub-Saharan Africa, only 37 per cent of primary schools, 52 per cent of lower secondary schools and 55 per cent of upper secondary schools have access to electricity.Qualified teachers are key for progress in education quality and learning. In 2016, according to estimates for primary education, 85 per cent of teachers worldwide were trained  only 71 per cent in Southern Asia and 61 per cent in subSaharan Africa.ODA for scholarships amounted to $1.2 billion in 2016. Institutions in Australia, France, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and European Union accounted for two thirds of this total.
