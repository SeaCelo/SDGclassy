Indicator 9.1.2: Passenger and freight volumes, by mode of transport
Target 9.1: Develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, including regional and trans-border infrastructure, to support economic development and human well-being, with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all
Goal 9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the sum of the passenger and freight volumes reported for road, rail and air carriers in terms of number of people and metric tonnes of cargo respectively. These are reported as separate series for each mode of transport and for passenger and freight volume.  
Concepts:
The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) through its Statistics Division have established standard methodologies and definitions to collect and report traffic (passenger and freight volume) data related to air transport. These standards and methodologies have been adopted by the 191 Member States of ICAO and also by the Industry stakeholders, i.e. air carriers and airports. The precise definition o fall concepts and metadata related to air transport reporting can be found at
http://www.icao.int/sustainability/pages/eap-sta-excel.aspx/ 
The International Transport Forum (ITF) collects data on transport (rail and road) statistics on annual basis from all its Member countries. Data are collected from Transport Ministries, statistical offices and other institution designated as official data source. Although there are clear definitions for all the terms used in this survey, countries might have different methodologies to calculate tonne-kilometres and passenger-kilometres. Methods could be based on traffic or mobility surveys, use very different sampling methods and estimating techniques which could affect the comparability of their statistics. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
Passenger and freight volumes moved by member states and regions is a robust proxy for measuring regional and trans-border infrastructure development. Any increases in volumes can be directly associated with improvements in such infrastructure, and resulting socio-economic benefits. 
Air transport is particularly important not only for the economic and job benefits, but also because it is one of the few modes of transport that could be relied upon during emergencies, such as natural disasters and disease outbreaks, for food, medicine, medical personnel, vaccine and other supplies to the affected areas and people. 
Data Sources and Collection Method
Data are collected from Transport Ministries, statistical offices and other institution designated as official data source. Although there are clear definitions for all the terms used in this survey, countries might have different methodologies to calculate tonne-kilometres and passenger-kilometres. Methods could be based on traffic or mobility surveys, use very different sampling methods and estimating techniques which could affect the comparability of their statistics. 
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
This indicator consists of six components (sum of the volume for respective components):
(1) Freight volume (tonne kilometres), by road transport;
(2) Passenger volume (passenger kilometres), by road transport;
(3) Freight volume (tonne kilometres), by rail transport;
(4) Passenger volume (passenger kilometres), by rail transport;
(5) Freight volume (tonne kilometres), by air transport; and
(6) Passenger volume (passenger kilometres), by air transport.

Indicator 9.2.1: Manufacturing value added as a proportion of GDP and per capita
Target 9.2: Promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and, by 2030, significantly raise industry's share of employment and gross domestic product, in line with national circumstances, and double its share in least developed countries
Goal 9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the ratio between manufacturing value added (MVA) and the gross domestic product (GDP), where both are reported in constant US dollars. It is represented as a percentage. 
MVA per capita is the total MVA divided by the total population of the country. 
Concepts:
Gross value added is a productivity metric that measures contributions to the economy. It is calculated using the system of national accounts (SNA) as the sum of all employee compensation, gross operating surplus of government and corporations, gross mixed income of unincorporated enterprises and taxes, minus any subsidies on production and imports, except for net taxes on products. 
MVA is the total value added to the economy by the manufacturing sector. Manufacturing sector is defined according to the International Standard Industrial Classification of all Economic Activities (ISIC) revision 3 (1990) or revision 4 (2008). It refers to industries belonging to sector D in revision 3 or sector C in revision 4. 
GDP is the sum of gross values added by all sectors that are a part of the economy. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
MVA is a well-recognized and widely used indicator by researchers and policy-makers to assess the level of industrialization of a country. The share of MVA in GDP reflects the role of manufacturing in the economy and a country’s national development in general. 
MVA per capita is an indicator of a country’s level of industrialization, adjusted to the size of its economy. It is widely used to classify country groups according to the stage of industrial development. Adjusted MVA per capita expressed in terms of an implicit estimate of MVA per capita at purchasing power parity (PPP) is used as the basic measure underlying the country groups in UNIDO statistics (UNIDO, 2013).
Data Sources and Collection Method
The data for this indicator is compiled by the national statistical offices, ministries of finance or economy, as part of their national accounting activities. 
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
The percentage value addition to GDP from the manufacturing sector (PManuf) can be calculated as: 
￼
MVA per capita can be calculated as: 
￼
Comments and limitations:
Issues with comparability may arise due to the use of different versions of the SNA or the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) that are used by countries. 
There may also be differences due to the use of exchange rate conversions to USD, different base years used for constant price data, and methods for recent period estimation.

Data Disaggregation
This indicator is not required to be disaggregated, but it can be disaggregated by various sectors within manufacturing. 
Indicator 9.2.2: Manufacturing employment as a proportion of total employment
Target 9.2: Promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and, by 2030, significantly raise industry's share of employment and gross domestic product, in line with national circumstances, and double its share in least developed countries
Goal 9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the percentage of manufacturing employment in the total employment of a country. 
Concepts:
Employment comprises all persons of working age who during a short reference period (one week), were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit. The working-age population is usually defined as all persons aged 15 and above. For further clarification, see: Resolution concerning statistics of work, employment and labour underutilization (2013), available from http://ilo.org/global/statistics-and-databases/standards-and-guidelines/resolutions-adopted-by-international-conferences-of-labour-statisticians/WCMS_230304/lang--en/index.htm.  
Manufacturing sector is defined according to the International Standard Industrial Classification of all Economic Activities (ISIC) revision 4 (2008, the latest) or revision 3 (1990). It refers to industries belonging to sector C in revision 4 or sector D in revision 3. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
This indicator conveys the contribution of manufacturing in total employment. It measures the ability of the manufacturing sector to absorb surplus labour forces from agricultural and other traditional sectors towards production labour with higher wages, when monitored over time. However, in developed countries an opposite trend is expected where emphasis has shifted to reduction in labor in manufacturing as part of cost-cutting measures, to promote more capital-intensive industries.
Data Sources and Collection Method
Data on the share of manufacturing employment can be obtained from a variety of sources, including labour force surveys and other similar types of household surveys, establishment surveys and administrative records. Labour force surveys are te preferred source of data for this indicator as they have the widest coverage: they cover all economic activities whithin its scope, all status in employment, all establishment sizes, formal and informal employment, etc. 
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
The percentage of manufacturing employment in total employment (PMEmp) is calculated as: 
￼
Comments and limitations:
The characteristics of the data source impact the international comparability of the data, especially in cases where the coverage of the source is less than comprehensive (either in terms of country territory or economic activities). In the absence of a labour force survey (the preferred source of data for this indicator), some countries may use an establishment survey to derive this indicator, but these usually have  a cut-off points such that small units which are not officially registered (whether in manufacturing or not) are not included in the survey and consequently, employment data may be underestimated. Discrepancies can also be caused by differences in the definition of employment or working age.

Indicator 9.3.1: Proportion of small-scale industries in total industry value added
Target 9.3: Increase the access of small-scale industrial and other enterprises, in particular in developing countries, to financial services, including affordable credit, and their integration into value chains and markets.
Goal 9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the share of manufacturing value added of small-scale manufacturing enterprises in the total manufacturing value added. 
Concepts:
An Enterprise is defined, in International recommendations for industrial statistics 2008 (IRIS 2008) (United Nations, 2011), as the smallest legal unit that constitutes an organizational unit producing goods or services. The enterprise is the basic statistical unit at which all information relating to its production activities and transactions, including financial and balance-sheet accounts, are maintained. It is also used for institutional sector classification in the 2008 System of National Accounts. 
In case of the large enterprises a distinction is made between an enterprise and establishment. An enterprise, especially those of larger size may own more than one establishment having different physical locations or kinds-of-activity. For this reason IRIS 2008 recommends establishment as a statistical unit for data collection purpose. However, small enterprises are pre-dominantly single-establishment enterprise. Therefore no distinction between enterprise and establishment is made in definition of this indicator. 
Small-scale industrial enterprises, in the SDG framework also called “small-scale industries”, refer to statistical units, generally enterprises, engaged in production of goods and services for market below a designated size class. The definition of size class in many countries is tied up with the legal and policy framework of the country. The size of a statistical unit based on employment should be defined primarily in terms of the average number of persons employed in that unit during the reference period. If the average number of persons employed is not available, the total number of persons employed in a single period may be used as the size criterion. The size classification should consist of the following classes of the average number of persons employed: 1-9, 10-19, 20-49, 50-249, 250 and more. This should be considered a minimum division of the overall range; more detailed classifications, where required, should be developed within this framework. 
Total numbers of persons employed is defined as the total number of persons who work in or for the statistical unit, whether full-time or part-time, including:
• Working proprietors
• Active business partners
• Unpaid family workers
• Paid employees 
Value added is derived as the difference between gross output and intermediate consumption or (United Nations, 2011), and cannot be directly observed from the accounting records of the units. The value added at basic prices is calculated as the difference between the gross output at basic prices and the intermediate consumption at purchasers’ prices. The valuation of value added closely corresponds to the valuation of gross output. If the output is valued at basic prices, then the valuation of value added is also at basic prices (the valuation of intermediate consumption is always at purchasers’ prices). 
All above mentioned terms are introduced to be in line with IRIS 2008 (United Nations, 2011). 
Rationale and Interpretation:
Industrial enterprises are classified to small compared to large or medium for their distinct nature of economic organization, production capability, scale of investment and other economic characteristics. “Small-scale industries” can be run with a small amount of capital, relatively unskilled labor and using local materials. Despite their small contribution to total industrial output, their role in job creation, especially in developing countries is recognized to be significant where the scope of absorbing surplus labour force from traditional sectors such as agriculture or fishery is very high. “Small-scale industries” are capable of meeting domestic demand of basic consumer goods such as food, clothes, furniture, etc.
Data Sources and Collection Method
Data are collected primary from annual industrial surveys, where value added is disaggregated by size classes given in terms of number of employees and from surveys focusing particularly on small enterprises, or small and medium enterprises in general. Data are collected from national statistical offices through questionnaire or directly from national publications or online data platforms.
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
The proportion of “small-scale industries” in total value added is an indicator calculated as a share of value added for small-scale manufacturing enterprises in total manufacturing value added: 
￼
“Small industry” here refers to an enterprise with less than 20 persons employed. The indicator is recommended to calculate separately for each ISIC section such as manufacturing, tradeor service activities as far as possible. 
Comments and limitations:
The main limitation of existing national data is varying size classes by country indicating that data are obtained from different target populations. Data of one country are not comparable to another. 
The definition of size class in many countries is tied up with the legal and policy framework of the country. It has implications on registration procedure, taxation and different waivers aimed to promote “small-scale industries”.  For the sole purpose of SDG monitoring IAEG-SDG has recommended that the indicator is calculated for enterprises with less than 20 persons employed.

Indicator 9.3.2: Proportion of small-scale industries with a loan or line of credit
Target 9.3: Increase the access of small-scale industrial and other enterprises, in particular in developing countries, to financial services, including affordable credit, and their integration into value chains and markets.
Goal 9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the number of “small-scale industries” with an active line of credit or a loan from a financial institution in the reference year in percentage to the total number of such enterprises. 
Concepts:
An Enterprise is defined, in International recommendations for industrial statistics 2008 (IRIS 2008) (United Nations, 2011), as the smallest legal unit that constitutes an organizational unit producing goods or services. The enterprise is the basic statistical unit at which all information relating to its production activities and transactions, including financial and balance-sheet accounts, are maintained. It is also used for institutional sector classification in the 2008 System of National Accounts. 
In case of the large enterprises a distinction is made between an enterprise and establishment. An enterprise, especially those of larger size may own more than one establishment having different physical locations or kinds-of-activity. For this reason IRIS 2008 recommends establishment as a statistical unit for data collection purpose. However, small enterprises are pre-dominantly single-establishment enterprise. Therefore no distinction between enterprise and establishment is made in definition of this indicator. 
Small-scale industrial enterprises, in the SDG framework also called “small-scale industries”, refer to statistical units, generally enterprises, engaged in production of goods and services for market below a designated size class. The definition of size class in many countries is tied up with the legal and policy framework of the country. The size of a statistical unit based on employment should be defined primarily in terms of the average number of persons employed in that unit during the reference period. If the average number of persons employed is not available, the total number of persons employed in a single period may be used as the size criterion. The size classification should consist of the following classes of the average number of persons employed: 1-9, 10-19, 20-49, 50-249, 250 and more. This should be considered a minimum division of the overall range; more detailed classifications, where required, should be developed within this framework. 
A loan is a financial instrument that is created when a creditor lends funds directly to a debtor and receives a non-negotiable document as evidence of the asset. This category includes overdrafts, mortgage loans, loans to finance trade credit and advances, repurchase agreements, financial assets and liabilities created by financial leases, and claims on or liabilities to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the form of loans. Trade credit and advances and similar accounts payable/receivable are not loans. Loans that have become marketable in secondary markets should be reclassified under debt securities. However, if only traded occasionally, the loan is not reclassified under debt securities (IMF, 2011). 
Lines of credit and loan commitments provide a guarantee that undrawn funds will be available in the future, but no financial liability/asset exists until such funds are actually provided. Undrawn lines of credit and undisbursed loan commitments are contingent liabilities of the issuing institutions— generally, banks (IMF, 2011). A loan or line of credit refers to regulated financial institutions only. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
Industrial enterprises are classified to small compared to large or medium for their distinct nature of economic organization, production capability, scale of investment and other economic characteristics. “Small-scale industries” can be run with a small amount of capital, relatively unskilled labor and using local materials. Despite their small contribution to total industrial output, their role in job creation, especially in developing countries is recognized to be significant where the scope of absorbing surplus labor force from traditional sectors such as agriculture or fishery is very high. “Small-scale industries” are capable of meeting domestic demand of basic consumer goods such as food, clothes, furniture, etc. 
Thus “small-scale industries” play an important role in the economy. However, it has quite limited access to financial services, especially in developing countries. In order to improve the skill of workers and technology for production, small-scale industrial enterprises require financial support in the form of preferential loan, credit etc. This indicator shows how widely financial institutions are serving the “small-scale industries”. Together with the indicator SDG 9.3.1, this indicator reflects the main message of the target 9.3 which promotes to increase the access of “small-scale industries” to financial services.
Data Sources and Collection Method
Data for this indicator are generally collected from small industrial establishment survey, credit survey or economic census. The central bank or similar institutions may also conduct the survey. In compilation of data it is important to consider that the statistical unit (respondent) of the survey should be an enterprise of borrower of the loan. 
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
The proportion of “small-scale industries” with a loan or line of credit is calculated as the number of “small-scale industries” with an active line of credit or a loan from a financial institution in the reference year in percentage to the total number of such enterprises:

Indicator 9.4.1: CO2 emissions per unit of value added
Target 9.4: By 2030, upgrade infrastructure and retrofit industries to make them sustainable, with increased resource-use efficiency and greater adoption of clean and environmentally sound technologies and industrial processes, with all countries taking action in accordance with their respective capabilities
Goal 9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the ratio between CO­2 emissions from fuel combustion and the value added of associated economic activities. It can be calculated either for the whole economy (GDP) or for particular sectors such as manufacturing (manufacturing value added). 
CO­2 emissions per unit of GDP is expressed in kilogrammes of CO­2 per USD (in constant prices). 
Concepts:
Gross value added is a productivity metric that measures contributions to the economy. It is calculated using the system of national accounts (SNA 2008) as the sum of all employee compensation, gross operating surplus of government and corporations, gross mixed income of unincorporated enterprises and taxes, minus any subsidies on production and imports, except for net taxes on products. 
CO­2 emissions for an economy are estimated based on energy consumption data for all sectors. For the manufacturing sector, the following subsectors are considered beyond the total manufacturing sector (energy used for transport by industry is reported under transport):
(1)    Iron and steel industry [ISIC Group 241 and Class 2431];
(2)    Chemical and petrochemical industry [ISIC Divisions 20 and 21] excluding petrochemical feedstocks;
(3)    Non-ferrous metals basic industries [ISIC Group 242 and Class 2432];
(4)    Non-metallic minerals such as glass, ceramic, cement, etc. [ISIC Division 23];
(5)    Transport equipment [ISIC Divisions 29 and 30];
(6)    Machinery comprises fabricated metal products, machinery and equipment other than transport equipment [ISIC Divisions 25 to 28];
(7)    Food and tobacco [ISIC Divisions 10 to 12];
(8)    Paper, pulp and printing [ISIC Divisions 17 and 18];
(9)    Wood and wood products (other than pulp and paper) [ISIC Division 16];
(10) Textile and leather [ISIC Divisions 13 to 15]; and
(11) Non-specified (any manufacturing industry not included above) [ISIC Divisions 22, 31 and 32] 
Rationale and Interpretation:
This indicator measures the amount of CO2 emissions from fuel consumption produced by an economic activity, per unit of economic output. When computed for the whole economy, it is a measure of the combines effects of: (1) the average carbon intensity of the energy mix (linked to the shares of the various fossil fuels in the total); (2) the structure of an economy (linked to the relative weight of more or less energy-intensive sectors); and (3) of the average efficiency in the use of energy. 
When computed for the manufacturing sector (CO2 emissions per unit MVA), it measures the combined effect of: (1) the carbon intensity of the manufacturing economic output (average carbon intensity of energy mix used); (2) the structure of the manufacturing sector (the energy efficiency of production technologies in each sub-sector); and (3) the economic value of the various output. 
Manufacturing industries are generally improving their emission intensity as countries move to higher levels of industrialization, but it should be noted that emission intensities can also be reduced through structural changes and product diversification in manufacturing. Lower values of CO2 per unit MVA could be interpreted as more efficient manufacturing structures. 
CO2 emissions account for roughly 80% of all greenhouse gas emissions from the manufacturing processes. 
Data Sources and Collection Method
Countries estimate CO2 emissions from fuel combustion based on energy consumption data and on the IPCC Guidelines for Greenhous Gas Inventories. Energy consumption data by fuel are collected through national surveys across consumption sectors as a part of national energy statistics.
Energy data are compiled according to harmonised international definitions and questionnaires, as described in the UN International Recommendations for Energy Statistics. For further information, see: https://unstats.un.org/unsd/energy/ires/ 
For further information on methodology on this indicator, see: http://wds.iea.org/wds/pdf/Worldco2_Documentation.pdf 
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
This indicator can be calculated using the following formula for each sector: 
￼
This indicator can be calculated for each sector. 
Comments and limitations:
Estimation of CO2 data is not systematized in many countries, although it is performed internationally based on harmonized energy data collected at the national level. There are possibilities of differences in different energy accounting systems followed by different countries. 
Energy consumption data and value-added date often come from different sources, which may raise some consistency issues.

This indicator is not required to be disaggregated. However, it can be disaggregated by manufacturing sub-sector. 
Indicator 9.5.1: Research and development expenditure as a proportion of GDP
Target 9.5: Enhance scientific research, upgrade the technological capabilities of industrial sectors in all countries, in particular developing countries, including, by 2030, encouraging innovation and substantially increasing the number of research and development workers per 1 million people and public and private research and development spending
Goal 9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the total intramural expenditure on research and experimental development (R&D) performed in the national territory during a specific reference period expressed as a percentage of national gross domestic product (GDP). 
Concepts:
Research and experimental development (R&D) comprise creative and systematic work undertaken in order to increase the stock of knowledge – including knowledge of humankind, culture and society – and to devise new applications of available knowledge. 
The term R&D covers three types of activity: basic research, applied research and experimental development. Basic research is experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts, without any particular application or use in view. Applied research is original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge. It is, however, directed primarily towards a specific, practical aim or objective. Experimental development is systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience and producing additional knowledge, which is directed to producing new products or processes or to improving existing products or processes. 
R&D expenditure or in other words Gross domestic expenditure on R&D (GERD) is total intramural expenditure on R&D performed in the national territory during a specific reference period. It covers all expenditure for R&D performed in the economy, including both current costs and capital expenditures for R&D. 
For further information on above definitions, see: OECD (2015). Frascati Manual. 7th Edition.  
GDP is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
This indicator is a direct measure of the R&D spending, which is to be increased as per target 9.5.
Data Sources and Collection Method
Data for this indicator is primarily collected through nationally representative R&D surveys, which are conducted by the national statistical offices or relevant line ministries such as the ministry of science and technology. The direct collection of R&D data through dedicated surveys has a distinct advantage in that the concepts and definitions used can align completely with those contained in the Frascati Manual. Administrative data sources (which may include both financial data from revenue agencies as well as other types of administrative sources, such as company records) may be used as another source of information for compilation of R&D data, if the concepts, definitions and coverage used by administrative data sources are sufficiently close to those contained in the Frascati Manual. 
The OECD Frascati Manual (please find the link in the reference section below) provides standard guidelines and recommendations for collecting and reporting internationally comparable statistics on the financial and human resources devoted to R&D.  The information on the coverage and contents of the different chapters of the Frascati Manual (2015) are summarized below as a guide to readers. Chapter 1 introduces the manual and the twelve subsequent chapters provide guidance on specific topics. The five chapters (2-6) that follow contain general guidance on defining and measuring R&D in all sectors of R&D performance: concepts and definitions, institutional sectors, R&D expenditures, R&D personnel, and statistical methodologies and procedures. The next five chapters (7-11) address particular methodological and classification issues specific to each performing sector (Business enterprise, Government, Higher education and Private non-profit). The fifth sector, the Rest of the world (formerly referred to as Abroad) is discussed in Chapter 11 on R&D globalisation, which addresses the performance and funding of R&D in the Rest of the world. In addition, there is guidance on data collection on multinational enterprises (MNEs) and R&D services trade. The sector chapters are followed by two chapters (12-13) that approach the measurement of government support for R&D from a funder perspective: government budget allocations for R&D and measurements of tax relief for R&D. 
The UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) provides a guide to conducting an R&D survey for countries starting to measure R&D (please find the link in the reference section below). In addition to summarizing main concepts and definitions from the Frascati Manual, this guide presents the relevant R&D indicators, addresses common issues encountered in data collection, provides a simple project management template, and proposes generic model questionnaires for the Government, Higher education, Business enterprise and Private non-profit sectors.
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
Research and development expenditure as a proportion of GDP (R&DIntensity) is calculated as: 
￼
Comments and limitations:
R&D data can be collected directly through surveys, through administrative data sources, or by combination of the two. The direct collection of R&D data has a distinct advantage in that the concepts and definitions used can align completely with those contained in the Frascati Manual, though this may have some cost implications. Furthermore, R&D data are not collected on a regular basis in many developing countries and that not all sectors of performance (Business enterprise, Government, Higher education, and Private non-profit) are covered. In particular, the Business enterprise sector often goes uncovered.

Data Disaggregation
R&D expenditure can be disaggregated by sector of performance, source of funds, field of R&D, type of research and type of cost.

Indicator 9.5.2: Researchers (in full-time equivalent) per million inhabitants
Target 9.5: Enhance scientific research, upgrade the technological capabilities of industrial sectors in all countries, in particular developing countries, including, by 2030, encouraging innovation and substantially increasing the number of research and development workers per 1 million people and public and private research and development spending
Goal 9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the number of researchers (in full-time equivalent) in the national territory during a specific reference period expressed as a proportion of a population of one million. 
Concepts:
Research and experimental development (R&D) comprise creative and systematic work undertaken in order to increase the stock of knowledge – including knowledge of humankind, culture and society – and to devise new applications of available knowledge. 
The term R&D covers three types of activity: basic research, applied research and experimental development. Basic research is experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts, without any particular application or use in view. Applied research is original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge. It is, however, directed primarily towards a specific, practical aim or objective. Experimental development is systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience and producing additional knowledge, which is directed to producing new products or processes or to improving existing products or processes. 
R&D personnel are all persons engaged directly in R&D, as well as those providing direct services for the R&D activities. They are classified according to their R&D function: researchers, technicians and other supporting staff.  Out of these, researchers play an essential role in the conduct of R&D projects or activities, by generally leading such projects (as contrasted with other R&D personnel). 
Researchers are professionals engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge. They conduct research and improve or develop concepts, theories, models, techniques, instrumentation, software or operational methods. 
Full-time equivalent (FTE) of R&D personnel (researchers) is defined as the ratio of working hours actually spent on R&D during a specific reference period (usually a calendar year) divided by the total number of hours conventionally worked in the same period by an individual or a group. Accordingly, one FTE of R&D personnel (researchers) is equivalent to one individual working full-time on R&D. Thus, an individual who normally spends 30% of his/her time on R&D and the rest on other activities (such as teaching, university administration and student counselling) should be considered as 0.3 FTE. Similarly, if a full-time R&D worker is employed at an R&D unit for only six months, this results in an FTE of 0.5. It is measured by combining two variables: actual involvement in R&D activities and formal engagement on the basis of normative or statutory working hours.
For further information on above definitions, see: OECD (2015). Frascati Manual. 7th Edition. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
This indicator is a direct measure of the number of R&D workers per million people, which is to be increased as per target 9.5.
Data Sources and Collection Method
Data for this indicator is primarily collected through nationally representative R&D surveys, which are conducted by the national statistical offices or relevant line ministries such as the ministry of science and technology. The direct collection of R&D data through dedicated surveys has a distinct advantage in that the concepts and definitions used can align completely with those contained in the Frascati Manual. Administrative data sources (which may include both financial data from revenue agencies as well as other types of administrative sources, such as company records) may be used as another source of information for compilation of R&D data, if the concepts, definitions and coverage used by administrative data sources are sufficiently close to those contained in the Frascati Manual. 
The OECD Frascati Manual (please find the link in the reference section below) provides standard guidelines and recommendations for collecting and reporting internationally comparable statistics on the financial and human resources devoted to R&D. The information on the coverage and contents of the different chapters of the Frascati Manual (2015) are summarized below as a guide to readers. Chapter 1 introduces the manual and the twelve subsequent chapters provide guidance on specific topics. The five chapters (2-6) that follow contain general guidance on defining and measuring R&D in all sectors of R&D performance: concepts and definitions, institutional sectors, R&D expenditures, R&D personnel, and statistical methodologies and procedures. The next five chapters (7-11) address particular methodological and classification issues specific to each performing sector (Business enterprise, Government, Higher education and Private non-profit). The fifth sector, the Rest of the world (formerly referred to as Abroad) is discussed in Chapter 11 on R&D globalisation, which addresses the performance and funding of R&D in the Rest of the world. In addition, there is guidance on data collection on multinational enterprises (MNEs) and R&D services trade. The sector chapters are followed by two chapters (12-13) that approach the measurement of government support for R&D from a funder perspective: government budget allocations for R&D and measurements of tax relief for R&D. 
The UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) provides a guide to conducting an R&D survey for countries starting to measure R&D (please find the link in the reference section below). In addition to summarizing main concepts and definitions from the Frascati Manual, this guide presents the relevant R&D indicators, addresses common issues encountered in data collection, provides a simple project management template, and proposes generic model questionnaires for the Government, Higher education, Business enterprise and Private non-profit sectors.
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
The number researchers (in full-time equivalent) per million inhabitants (RESDensity) is calculated as: 
￼
where  ‘Total researchers (FTE)’  is calculated as: 
￼
Comments and limitations:
R&D data can be collected directly through surveys, through administrative data sources, or by combination of the two. The direct collection of R&D data has a distinct advantage in that the concepts and definitions used can align completely with those contained in the Frascati Manual, though this may have some cost implications. Furthermore, R&D data are not collected on a regular basis in many developing countries and that not all sectors of performance (Business enterprise, Government, Higher education, and Private non-profit) are covered. In particular, the Business sector often goes uncovered. 
Proxy, alternative and additional indicators: N/A
Data Disaggregation
Researchers can be disaggregated by sector of employment, field of R&D, sex, level of qualification and age.  The Frascati Manual provides more details related to these breakdowns (what these breakdowns/classifications are, the purposes, including user needs, the main criteria that are applied, etc).
Indicator 9.a.1: Total official international support (official development assistance plus other official flows) to infrastructure
Target 9.a: Facilitate sustainable and resilient infrastructure development in developing countries through enhanced financial, technological and technical support to African countries, least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States
Goal 9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the sum of all gross disbursements of Official Development Assistance (ODA) and Other Official Flows (OOF) from all donors in support of infrastructure development. 
Concepts:
The Development Assistance Committee (DAC) defines ODA as those flows to countries and territories on the DAC list of ODA recipients and multilateral institutions which are:
(1)    Provided by official agencies, including state and local governments, or by their executive agencies; and
(2)    Each transaction of which:
a. is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; and
b. is concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25 percent (calculated at a rate of discount of 10%). 
OOF refer to all other official sector transactions that do not meet the ODA criteria, and are not export credits. 
Infrastructure support refers to all OECD Creditor Reporting System (CRS) purpose codes in the 200 series (see http://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/purposecodessectorclassification.htm).  
Rationale and Interpretation:
Total resource flows to developing countries quantify the public effort (excluding export credits) that donors provide to developing countries for infrastructure. 
Data Sources and Collection Method
Data is received from national focal points (statistical reporter) within national aid agencies, ministries of foreign affairs or finance etc.
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
This indicator is calculated as the sum of all ODA and OOF from donors to developing countries for infrastructure (CRS codes in the 200 series). 
Comments and limitations:
The CRS data are available from 1973. However, the data coverage, at an activity level, is considered complete from 1995 for commitments and 2002 for disbursements. 
Proxy, alternative and additional indicators: N/A
Data Disaggregation
This indicator can be disaggregated by type of flow (ODA or OOF), by donor, recipient country, type of finance, type of aid, sub-sector etc. 
Indicator 9.b.1: Proportion of medium and high-tech industry value added in total value added
Target 9.b: Support domestic technology development, research and innovation in developing countries, including by ensuring a conducive policy environment for, inter alia, industrial diversification and value addition to commodities
Goal 9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the percentage of medium-high and high technology (MHT) industries to the total value added of all manufacturing industries 
Concepts:
The value added of an industry (industry value added) is a survey concept that refers to the given industry’s net output derived from the difference of gross output and intermediate consumption. Manufacturing sector is defined according to the International Standard Industrial Classification of all Economic Activities (ISIC) revision 3 (1990) or revision 4 (2008). It refers to industries belonging to sector D in revision 3 or sector C in revision 4. 
Technology classification is based on research and development (R&D) expenditure relative to value added otherwise referred as R&D intensity.  Data for R&D intensity are presented in a report (Galindo-Rueda and Verger, 2016) published by the OECD in 2016, which also proposes a taxonomy for industry groups with different ranges of R&D expenditure relative to their gross value added. MHT industries have traditionally been defined exclusively to manufacturing industries. However, there have been recent efforts (Galindo-Rueda and Verger, 2016) to extend the definition to non-manufacturing industries as well. Nevertheless, medium-high and high technology sectors also in new paper are primarily represented by manufacturing industries.
MHT manufacturing industries refer to all sub-codes within the following ISIC codes:
(1)    ISIC Rev. 4 – 20, 21, 252, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 (excluding 301), 325; or
(2)    ISIC Rev. 3 –24, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35 (excluding 351). 
Rationale and Interpretation:
Industrial development generally entails structural transition from resource-based and low technology activities to MHT activities. Modern, highly complex production structures offer better opportunities for skills development and technological innovation. MHT activities are considered high-value addition industries with higher technological intensity and labour productivity. By tracking this indicator, the level of domestic technology, as well as that of research and innovation can be observed. 
An increasing share of MHT reflects domestic technological advancedment through higher impacts of innovation.
Data Sources and Collection Method
The data for this indicator is compiled by the national statistical offices, ministries of finance or economy, as part of their national accounting activities. It is strongly recommended to use the system of national accounts (2008) and to track economic activity at least at 3-digit ISIC. 
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
The percentage contribution of MHT to total MVA (PMHT)can be calculated as: 
 ￼
Comments and limitations:
Value added by economic activity should be reported at least at 3-digit ISIC for compiling MHT values.
Proxy, alternative and additional indicators: N/A
Data Disaggregation
No disaggregation is available for this indicator.
Indicator 9.c.1: Proportion of population covered by a mobile network, by technology
Target 9.c: Significantly increase access to information and communications technology and strive to provide universal and affordable access to the Internet in least developed countries by 2020
Goal 9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation
 
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the percentage of inhabitants living within range of a mobile-cellular signal (2G, 3G or LTE), irrespective of whether or not they are mobile phone subscribers or users. 
Concepts:
2G population coverage refers to population with access only to mobile networks with data communications at downstream speeds below 256Kbit/s. This includes mobile-cellular technologies such as GPRS, CDMA2000 1x and most EDGE implementations. 
3G population coverage refers to population with access to 3G mobile-cellular signals. This includes mobile-cellular technologies such as HSPA, UMTS and EV-DO. It excludes people covered only by GPRS, EDGE or CDMA 1xRTT. 
LTE population coverage refers to population with access to LTE/LTE-Advanced, mobile WiMAX/WirelessMAN or other more advanced mobile-cellular networks. It excludes people covered only by HSPA, UMTS, EV-DO and previous 3G technologies, and also excludes fixed WiMAX coverage. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
Percentage of population covered by a mobile network can be considered as a baseline indicator for ICT access, as it measures the possibility to subscribe and use cellular services for communication. As mobile networks expand, more people have such subscription opportunities, thus overcoming basic infrastructure barriers exhibited by fixed-telephone (landline) networks. Disaggregation by technology (2G, 3G and LTE) offers proxy measures of access to different kinds of cellular services, such as voice only (for 2G) and increasingly high-speed access to the internet and other data-based services (for 3G and LTE). This indicator is, therefore, a direct insight into the level of digital divide prevalent in a country, and would help design targeted policies to overcome remaining infrastructure barriers. 
Data Sources and Collection Method
This data can be collected from licensed mobile-cellular operators. In cases where operators have different levels and locations of coverage, they should be requested to provide each operator’s coverage maps, which can be overlaid with maps showing the population of the country.
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
The percentage of inhabitants living within range of a mobile-cellular signal (2G, 3G or LTE) (Pmob) is calculated as: 
￼
Comments and limitations:
The indicator is based on where the population lives, and not where they work or go to school, etc. When there are multiple operators offering the service, the maximum population number covered should be reported. 
In some countries, data only refers to the operator with the largest coverage. In such cases, coverage could be understated. 
Proxy, alternative and additional indicators: N/A
Data Disaggregation
This indicator is required to be disaggregated by technology (2G, 3G and LTE). It can be disaggregated by location (rural/urban). 
SDG 9: Infrastructure and Industrialization

Investments in infrastructure  transport, irrigation, energy and information and communication technology  are crucial to achieving sustainable development and empowering communities in many countries. It has long been recognized that growth in productivity and incomes, and improvements in health and education outcomes require investment in infrastructure

Manufacturing is an important driver of economic development and employment. At the current time, however, manufacturing value added per capita is only US$100 in the least developed countries compared to over US$4,500 in Europe and Northern America. Another important factor to consider is the emission of Carbon Dioxide during manufacturing processes. Emissions have decreased over the past decade in many countries but the pace of decline has not been even around the world.

Technological progress is the foundation of efforts to achieve environmental objectives, such as increased resource and energy-efficiency. Without technology and innovation, industrialization will not happen, and without industrialization, development will not happen. There needs to be more investments in high-tech products that dominate the manufacturing productions to increase efficiency and a focus on mobile cellular services that increase connections between people.



Basic infrastructure like roads, information and communication technologies, sanitation, electrical power and water remains scarce in many developing countries
16% of the global population does not have access to mobile broadband networks.
For many African countries, particularly the lower-income countries, the existent constraints regarding infrastructure affect firm productivity by around 40 per cent.
The global share of manufacturing value added in GDP increased from 15.2% in 2005 to 16.3% in 2017, driven by the fast growth of manufacturing in Asia.
Industrializations job multiplication effect has a positive impact on society. Every job in manufacturing creates 2.2 jobs in other sectors.
Small and medium-sized enterprises that engage in industrial processing and manufacturing are the most critical for the early stages of industrialization and are typically the largest job creators. They make up over 90 per cent of business worldwide and account for between 50-60 per cent of employment.
Least developed countries have immense potential for industrialization in food and beverages (agro-industry), and textiles and garments, with good prospects for sustained employment generation and higher productivity
Middle-income countries can benefit from entering the basic and fabricated metals industries, which offer a range of products facing rapidly growing international demand
In developing countries, barely 30 per cent of agricultural production undergoes industrial processing. In high-income countries, 98 per cent is processed. This suggests that there are great opportunities for developing countries in agribusiness.
Goal 9 targets

Develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, including regional and transborder infrastructure, to support economic development and human well-being, with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all
Promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and, by 2030, significantly raise industrys share of employment and gross domestic product, in line with national circumstances, and double its share in least developed countries
Increase the access of small-scale industrial and other enterprises, in particular in developing countries, to financial services, including affordable credit, and their integration into value chains and markets upgrade infrastructure and retrofit industries to make them sustainable, with increased resource-use efficiency and greater adoption of clean and environmentally sound technologies and industrial processes, with all countries taking action in accordance with their respective capabilities
Enhance scientific research, upgrade the technological capabilities of industrial sectors in all countries, in particular developing countries, including, by 2030, encouraging innovation and substantially increasing the number of research and development workers per 1 million people and public and private research and development spending
Facilitate sustainable and resilient infrastructure development in developing countries through enhanced financial, technological and technical support to African countries, least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States 18
Support domestic technology development, research and innovation in developing countries, including by ensuring a conducive policy environment for, inter alia, industrial diversification and value addition to commodities
Significantly increase access to information and communications technology and strive to provide universal and affordable access to the Internet in least developed countries by 2020

Industrializations job multiplication effect has a positive impact on society. Every one job in manufacturing creates 2.2 jobs in other sectors.
INDUSTRY, INNOVATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE
To build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation
Economic growth, social development and climate action are heavily dependent on investments in infrastructure, sustainable industrial development and technological progress.
In the face of a rapidly changing global economic landscape and increasing inequalities, sustained growth must include industrialization that first of all, makes opportunities accessible to all people, and two, is supported by innovation and resilient infrastructure.
Basic infrastructure like roads, information and communication technologies, sanitation, electrical power and water remains scarce in many developing countries. Approximately 1.2 billion people do not have access to reliable phone services. 2.3 billion people worldwide lack access to basic sanitation and almost 800 million lack access to water. In developing countries, barely 30 per cent of agricultural production undergoes industrial processing.
Its about our livelihoods. The growth of new industries means improvement in the standard of living for many of us. Also, if industries pursue sustainability, this approach will have a positive effect on the environment. Climate change affects all us.
The price is steep. Ending poverty would be more difficult, given the industrys role as a core driver of the global development agenda to eradicate poverty and advance sustainable development.
Additionally, failing to improve infrastructure and promote technological innovation could translate into poor health care, inadequate sanitation and limited access to education.
Establish standards and promote regulations that ensure company projects and initiatives are sustainably managed.
Collaborate with NGOs and the public sector to help promote sustainable growth within developing countries.
Think about how industry impacts on your life and well-being and use social media to push for policymakers to prioritize the SDGs.

Goal 9. Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation
Goal 9 encompasses three important aspects of sustainable development: infrastructure, industrialization and innovation. Infrastructure provides the basic physical systems and structures essential to the operation of a society or enterprise. Industrialization drives economic growth, creates job opportunities and thereby reduces income poverty. Innovation advances the technological capabilities of industrial sectors and prompts the development of new skills. An important component of physical infrastructure is air shipping and air travel. In 2014, 45 per cent of all air passengers originated from developing regions; 55 per cent originated from developed regions. However, in the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States, air passenger volume was extremely low, making up only 0.8 per cent, 0.8 per cent and 1.4 per cent, respectively, of the global total. Similar patterns are found for freight volumes in air transit: the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States made up only 1.1 per cent, 0.9 per cent and 2.6 per cent of the global total, respectively, in 2014.Manufacturing is a foundation of economic development, employment and social stability. In 2015, the share of manufacturing value added in terms of GDP of developed regions was estimated at 13 per cent, a decrease over the past decade owing largely to the increasing role of services in developed regions. In contrast, the share of manufacturing value added in GDP remained relatively stagnant for developing regions, increasing marginally from 19 per cent in 2005 to 21 per cent in 2015. Those values hide substantial differences, with manufacturing value added contributing over 31 per cent to GDP in Eastern Asia and 10 per cent or less in both sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania. The least developed countries face particular challenges in industrializing. Although those countries represent 13 per cent of the global population, they contribute less than 1 per cent of global manufacturing value added. Worldwide, about 500 million people are employed in manufacturing. While manufacturing job numbers have fallen in industrialized countries, they have steadily increased in developing countries. In the least developed countries, agricultural and traditional sectors remain the main sources of employment. In developing countries, small-scale industries accounted for an estimated 15 per cent to 20 per cent of value added and 25 per cent to 30 per cent of total industrial employment in 2015. However, access to financial services in those countries remains a problem. Globally, the credit gap for small and medium enterprises (defined as having between 5 and 99 employees) was estimated at $3.2 trillion to $3.9 trillion in 2012. In emerging markets, between 45 per cent and 55 per cent of all small and medium enterprises are unserved or underserved by financial services.As the structure of world economies shifts to less energy-intensive industries and countries implement policies for enhanced energy efficiency, almost all regions have shown a reduction in carbon intensity of GDP. Global carbon dioxide emissions per unit of value added showed a steady decline between 1990 and 2013, a decrease of about 30 per cent.Innovation and the creation of new and more sustainable industries are spurred by investments in research and development. Global expenditure on research and development as a proportion of GDP stood at 1.7 per cent in 2013. However, this figure masks wide disparities. expenditure on research and development was 2.4 per cent of GDP for developed regions, 1.2 per cent for developing regions, and below 0.3 per cent for the least developed countries and landlocked developing countries. The number of researchers per 1 million inhabitants showed a similar pattern. While the global average was 1,083 researchers per 1 million inhabitants, the ratio ranged from 65 per 1 million in the least developed countries to 3,641 per 1 million in developed regions.Total official flows for economic infrastructure in developing regions reached $59.5 billion in 2014. The main sectors receiving assistance were transport and energy. Infrastructure and economic development also rely on information and communications technology. Mobile cellular services have spread rapidly around the world, allowing people in previously unconnected areas to join the global information society. By 2015, the percentage of the population living in areas covered by mobile broadband networks stood at 69 per cent globally. In rural areas, the share was only 29 per cent.
Goal 9. Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation
Despite steady improvements in manufacturing output and employment, renewed investment will be needed in the least developed countries to build needed infrastructure and ensure the doubling of industrys share of GDP in those countries by 2030.
		Efficient transportation services generate employment and wealth and drive economic development. In 2015, the estimated global economic impact (both direct and indirect) of air transport was $2.7 trillion, equivalent to 3.5 per cent of global GDP. The least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States represent far less air travel and freight volumes, with each country group accounting for only 1 per cent to 2.7 per cent of the global total.
		Manufacturing is a principal driver of economic development, employment and social stability. Globally, manufacturing value added as a share of GDP increased from 15.3 per cent in 2005 to 16.2 per cent in 2016. In 2016, manufacturing value added per capita amounted to $4,621 in Europe and Northern America, compared to about $100 in the least developed countries. 
		As many countries move to more efficient and less energy-intensive industries, their emissions of carbon dioxide per unit of manufacturing value added are generally declining. From 2000 to 2014, Europe and Northern America reduced their emissions intensity by 36 per cent. All of the 10 largest manufacturing countries saw decreases in their emissions intensity. Such promising trends are not reflected in the global emissions intensity level, however, since a significant share of global manufacturing value added has moved to countries with generally higher intensity levels.
		In 2014, investments in research and development stood at 1.7 per cent of global GDP, up from 1.5 per cent in 2000. Worldwide, there were 1,098 researchers per million inhabitants in 2014, ranging from 63 in the least developed countries to 3,500 in Europe and Northern America.
		ODA for economic infrastructure in developing countries reached $57 billion in 2015, an increase of 32 per cent in real terms since 2010. The main recipient sectors were transport and energy ($19 billion each).
		Manufacturing is increasingly shifting towards more technologically complex products. While medium- and high-tech products continue to dominate manufacturing production in industrialized economies (where they contribute about 80 per cent of total manufacturing output), the share has barely reached 10 per cent in least developed countries. 
		Mobile-cellular services have spread rapidly and have allowed people living in previously unconnected areas to join the global information society. In 2016, 95 per cent of the worlds population and 85 per cent of people in the least developed countries were covered by a mobile-cellular signal. 
Goal 9. Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation
To achieve inclusive and sustainable industrialization, dynamic and competitive economic forces need to be unleashed to generate employment and income, facilitate international trade and enable the efficient use of resources. The global share of manufacturing value added in GDP increased from 15.2 per cent in 2005 to 16.3 per cent in 2017, driven by the rapid growth of manufacturing in Asia and reflecting the continuing recovery from the recession of recent years. Although the share of manufacturing in GDP in the least developed countries continued to grow, reaching 12.3 per cent of GDP in 2017, the manufacturing value added per capita in the least developed countries was only $109, about one fortieth of the amount registered in Europe and Northern America. The share of manufacturing in total employment has declined from 17.6 per cent in 1991 to 13.2 per cent in 2016.Globally, carbon dioxide emissions intensity decreased by 19 per cent in 2015 to 0.31 kg carbon dioxide per dollar from 0.38 kg carbon dioxide per dollar in 2000. This trend was evident in manufacturing industries as well, with global manufacturing intensity declining at an average annual rate of over 2 per cent from 2010 to 2015.Global investment in research and development grew at an annual average growth rate of 4.5 per cent from 2000 to 2015, reaching $1.9 trillion (purchasing power parity), or 1.7 per cent of global GDP, in 2015.The number of researchers worldwide has been growing at an average annual rate of 3.7 per cent from 2000 to 2015, meaning that there are 1,151 researchers per 1 million inhabitants. This value varies widely between regions, from 96 per 1 million inhabitants in sub-Saharan Africa to 3,639 in Europe and Northern America.Total official flows for economic infrastructure in developing countries reached $56 billion in 2016, a slight decrease since 2015 but an increase of 27 per cent in real terms since 2010. The main recipient sectors continue to be transport and energy.An increase in the share of medium-high and high-tech industries in total manufacturing value added can indicate a countrys capacity to introduce new technologies in other sectors as well. In 2015, medium-high and high-tech sectors accounted for 44.7 per cent of manufacturing value added globally and reached 34.6 per cent in developing economies, up from 21.5 per cent in 2005.Most mobile subscribers worldwide now have access to higher-quality networks. By 2016, the proportion of population covered by a 3G mobile broadband network stood at 61 per cent in the least developed countries and 84 per cent globally. If this trend continues, the least developed countries are on track to reach over 90 per cent mobile broadband coverage by 2020.
