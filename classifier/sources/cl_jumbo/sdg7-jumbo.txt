Indicator 7.1.2: Proportion of population with primary reliance on clean fuels and technology
Target 7.1: By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services
Goal 7: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the number of people using clean fuels and technologies for domestic cooking, heating and lighting divided by total population reporting any cooking, heating or lighting. It is expressed as a percentage. 
Concepts:
Clean fuel and technologies is defined by the emission rate targets and specific fuel recommendations that are contained in the ‘Guidelines for Indoor Air Quality: Household Fuel Combustion’ report by WHO [http://www.who.int/indoorair/guidelines/hhfc/en/]. 
Rationale and Interpretation:
Cooking, lighting and heating represent a large share of household energy use across low and middle income countries. Fuels paired with inefficient technologies (such as open fires, inefficient stoves, space heaters and lamps) are associated with high levels of household (indoor) air pollution, which is, for cooking alone, estimated to cause over 4 million deaths annually. However, these deaths are avoidable with the adoption of clean fuels and technologies. This indicator measures the share of such adoption in the total population. 
Countries classified as high-income with a Gross National Income (GNI) of more than US$ 12,234[1] per capita are assumed to have made a complete transition to using clean fuels and technologies as the primary domestic energy source. For heating and lighting, the same methodology with the same above-mentioned assumptions will be used.

Data Sources and Collection Method
Data for this indicator can be routinely collected at the national levels in most countries using censuses and household surveys including: United States Agency for International Development (USAID)-supported Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS); United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)-supported Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS); WHO-supported World Health Surveys (WHS); World Bank’s Living Standard Measurement Surveys (LSMS) and other reliable and nationally representative country surveys. 
In addition, the World Health Organization compiles a database of statistics on access to clean and polluting fuels and technologies that it has collected from the full global body of household surveys for cooking, heating and lighting. Currently, the WHO Database covers cooking energy for 157 countries and one territory for the period 1970-2016 and is updated regularly and publicly available.
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
The indicator is calculated as follows:
￼
Please note that this indicator is currently calculated by the WHO and reported at the global level based on the main type of fuel for cooking. Currently, clean cooking is defined as primary use of electricity, biogas, alcohol fuels, liquified petroluem gas or piped natural gas. Cooking occupies the largest share of overall household energy needs. Information on main cooking fuel use is widely available on household surveys and serves as surrogate for household eneregy access. Presently, the limited data collection on the technologies for cooking, heating and lighting is as a constraint for expanding this indicator to include the fuels and technologies used for other household energy end-uses. However in the future, the fuels and technologeis used for both lighting and heating, as well as the cooking stove itself will be included in reporting, as country level data are becoming increasingly avaialble with more robust monitoring.
The indicator is currenlty modelled for the purpose of monitoring trends and providing point estimates for countries and regions in specific years. 
Comments and limitations:
Households may use other secondary cooking fuels and stoves that may be harmful, but are not captured by this indicator. Depending on climatic and geographic conditions, heating and lighting with polluting fuels and technology combinations (also not captured by this indicator) can also be a contributor to household air pollution levels (in addition to contribute to outdoor air pollution). 
Currently there is a limited amount of available data capturing the type of cookstoves and the fuel and devices used in the home for heating and lighting. Progress is underway towards developing and piloting new methodologies like the World Bank’s Multi-tier Tracking Framework to capture the type of fuel and technological devices being used in households for cooking, heating and lighting.

Data Disaggregation
This indicator can be disaggregated by urban/rural place of residence, by estimates for different end-uses, and by fuel types.
Indicator 7.2.1: Renewable energy share in the total final energy consumption
Target 7.2: By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix
Goal 7: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all
Definition and Rationale
Definition: 
The renewable energy share in total final consumption is the percentage of final consumption of energy that is derived from renewable resources. 
Concepts:
Renewable energy consumption includes consumption of energy derived from: hydro, solid biofuels, wind, solar, liquid biofuels, biogas, geothermal, marine and waste. Total final energy consumption is calculated from national balances and statistics as total final consumption minus non-energy use.
Comments with regard to specific renewable energy resources:
	•	Solar energy consumption includes solar PV and solar thermal
	•	Liquid biofuel energy consumption includes biogasoline, biodiesels and other liquid biofuels
	•	Solid biofuel consumption includes fuelwood, animal waste, vegetable waste, black liquor, bagasse and charcoal
	•	Waste energy covers energy from renewable municipal waste 
Rationale and Interpretation:
The target “By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix” impacts all three dimensions of sustainable development. Renewable energy technologies represent a major element in strategies for greening economies everywhere in the world and for tackling the critical global problem of climate change. A number of definitions of renewable energy exist; what they have in common is highlighting as renewable all forms of energy that their consumption does not deplete their availability in the future. These include solar, wind, ocean, hydropower, geothermal resources, and bioenergy (in the case of bioenergy, which can be depleted, sources of bioenergy can be replaced within a short to medium-term frame). Importantly, this indicator focuses on the amount of renewable energy actually consumed rather than the capacity for renewable energy production, which cannot always be fully utilized. By focusing on consumption by the end user, it avoids the distortions caused by the fact that conventional energy sources are subject to significant energy losses along the production chain.
Data Sources and Collection Method
Specialized industry surveys (e.g. on bioenergy use) or household surveys (in combination with the measurement of other indicators) would be feasible approaches to data collection (e.g. for use of firewood, off-grid solar energy). 
Data on renewable energy consumption are also available through national Energy Balances produced by the International Energy Agency and the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) for more than 180 countries. The energy balances make it possible to trace all the different sources and uses of energy at the national level.
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
The percentage of renewable energy in the total final energy consumption (PRE) is calculated as follows: 
￼
where,
ECRE is the energy consumption from all renewable sources (megajoules); and
ECTotal is the total final energy consumption (megajoules). 
This indicator is based on the development of comprehensive energy statistics across supply and demand for all energy sources – statistics used to produce a national energy balance.  Once a national energy balance is developed, the indicator can be calculated by dividing consumption of energy from all renewable sources by total final energy consumption.  Renewable energy consumption is derived from three tables of the IEA world energy statistics and balances: total final consumption, electricity output and heat output. 
Comments and limitations:
A limitation with existing renewable energy statistics is that they are not able to distinguish whether renewable energy is being sustainably produced. For example, a substantial share of today’s renewable energy consumption comes from the use of wood and charcoal by households in the developing world, which sometimes may be associated with unsustainable forestry practices. There are efforts underway to improve the ability to measure the sustainability of bio-energy, although this remains a significant challenge. 
Off-grid renewables data is limited and not sufficiently captured in the energy statistics 
The method of allocation of renewable energy consumption from electricity and heat output assumes that the share of transmission and distribution losses are the same between all technologies. However, this is not always true because renewables are usually located in more remote areas from consumption centers and may incur larger losses. 
Likewise, imports and exports of electricity and heat are assumed to follow the share of renewability of electricity and heat generation, respectively. This is a simplification that in many cases will not affect the indicator too much, but that might do so in some cases, for example, when a country only generates electricity from fossil fuels but imports a great share of the electricity it uses from a neighboring country’s hydroelectric power plant. 
Methodological challenges associated with defining and measuring renewable energy are more fully described the Global Tracking Framework (IEA and World Bank, 2013) Chapter 4, Section 1, page 194-200. Data for traditional use of solid biofuels are generally scares globally, and developing capacity in tracking such energy use, including developing national level surveys, is essential for sound global energy tracking. 
Imports and exports of electricity from neighbouring countries may also have minor implications to the calculation of this indicator.

Data Disaggregation
disaggregation of data on consumption of renewable energy by resource and end-use sector could provide insights into other dimensions of the goal, such as affordability and reliability. For solar energy, it may also be useful to disaggregate between grid and off-grid capacity. 
Indicator 7.3.1: Energy intensity measured in terms of primary energy and GDP
Target 7.3: By 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency
Goal 7: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all 
Definition and Rationale
Definition: 
Energy intensity is defined as the total energy supplied to the economy per unit value of economic output. It is measured in Megajoules per United States Dollar. 
Concepts:
Total energy supply, as defined by the International Recommendations for Energy Statistics (IRES), as made up of production plus net imports minus international marine and aviation bunkers plus-stock changes. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the measure of economic output. For international comparison purposes, GDP is measured in constant terms at purchasing power parity 
Rationale and Interpretation:
Energy intensity is an indication of how much energy is used to produce one unit of economic output. It is a proxy of the efficiency with which an economy is able to use energy to produce economic output. A lower ratio indicates that less energy is used to produce one unit of output.
Data Sources and Collection Method
Total energy supply is typically calculated in the making of national energy balances, which are maintained by the ministries of energy or national statistical offices in countries. GDP figures are also calculated by national statistical offices or other relevant agencies as part of their macroeconomic data gathering and statistical record keeping. 
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
Energy intensity (EI) can be calculated using the following formula:
￼
This indicator is based on the development of comprehensive energy statistics across supply and demand for all energy sources – statistics used to produce a national energy balance. Internationally agreed methodologies for energy statistics are described in the “International Recommendations for Energy Statistics” (IRES), adopted by the UN Statistical Commission, available at: https://unstats.un.org/unsd/energy/ires/. 
Comments and limitations:
Energy intensity is only an imperfect proxy for energy efficiency. It can be affected by a number of factors, such as climate, structure of the economy, nature of economic activities etc. that are not necessarily linked to pure efficiency. 
Proxy, alternative and additional indicators:
Data Disaggregation
Disaggregation of energy intensity, e.g. by sector, could provide further insights into progress towards energy efficiency. At present it is only feasible to calculate such sector disaggregations for the following sectors – industry, residential, transport, agriculture, households – as reported in the Global Tracking Framework. It would be desirable, over time, to develop more refined sectoral level energy intensity indicators that make it possible to look at energy intensity by industry (e.g. cement, steel) or by type of vehicle (e.g. cars, trucks), for example. Doing so will not be possible without statistical collaboration with the relevant energy consuming sectors.
Decomposition analysis of energy intensity trends seeks to filter out factors that affect energy demand, such as economy wide scale and structure shifts, from more narrowly defined energy intensity shifts. The methodology applies decomposition analysis to isolate a more refined measure of energy intensity, one that sifts out the temporal shift of relative sector weights. This analysis is also reported in the Global Tracking Framework.
Indicator 7.a.1: International financial flows to developing countries in support of clean energy research and development and renewable energy production, including in hybrid systems
Target 7.a: By 2030, enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and technology, including renewable energy, energy efficiency and advanced and cleaner fossil-fuel technology, and promote investment in energy infrastructure and clean energy technology
Goal 7: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all
Definition and Rationale
Definition:
This indicator is defined as the total public international financial flows, i.e. ODA and OOF and the IRENA flows, to developing countries in support of clean energy research and development and renewable energy production, including in hybrid systems. They are expressed in current United States Dollars (USD). 
Concepts:
Official Development Assistance (ODA) is defined by OECD’s Development Assistance Committee (DAC) as those flows to countries and territories on the DAC list of ODA recipients and to multilateral institutions which are:
(1)    Provided by official agencies, including state and local governments, or by their executive agencies; and
(2)    Each transaction if which:
(a) is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; and
(b) is concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25 percent (calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent). 
Other Official Flows (OOF) are defined as transactions by the official sector which do not meet the conditions for eligibility as ODA, either because they are not primarily aimed at development, or because they are not sufficiently concessional. They also exclude officially supported export credits. 
Clean energy research and development and renewable energy production, including in hybrid systems covers the following sector codes: 
23210 Energy generation, renewable sources – multiple technologies - Renewable energy generation programmes that cannot be attributed to one single technology (codes 23220 through 23280 below). Fuelwood/charcoal production should be included under forestry 31261;
23220 Hydro-electric power plants - Including energy generating river barges;
23230 Solar energy - Including photo-voltaic cells, solar thermal applications and solar heating;
23240 Wind energy - Wind energy for water lifting and electric power generation;
23250 Marine energy - Including ocean thermal energy conversion, tidal and wave power;
23260 Geothermal energy - Use of geothermal energy for generating electric power or directly as heat for agriculture, etc.; and
23270 Biofuel-fired power plants Use of solids and liquids produced from biomass for direct power generation. Also includes biogases from anaerobic fermentation (e.g. landfill gas, sewage sludge gas, fermentation of energy crops and manure) and thermal processes (also known as syngas); waste fired power plants making use of biodegradable municipal waste (household waste and waste from companies and public services that resembles household waste, collected at installations specifically designed for their disposal with recovery of combustible liquids, gases or heat). See code 23360 for non-renewable waste-fired power plants. 
Research and development of energy efficiency technologies and measures is captured under CRS sector code 23182 on Energy research. The above flows also include technical assistance provided to support production, research and development as defined above. 
The IRENA flows are defined as all additional loans, grants and equity investments received by developing countries (defined as countries in developing regions, as listed in the UN M49 composition of regions) from all foreign governments, multilateral agencies and additional development finance institutions (including export credits, where available) for the purpose of clean energy research and development and renewable energy production, including in hybrid systems. These additional flows cover the same technologies and other activities (research and development, technical assistance, etc.) as listed above and exclude all flows extracted from the OECD/DAC Creditor Reporting System (CRS). 
Rationale and Interpretation:
Total ODA and OOF flows to developing countries quantify the public financial effort (excluding export credits) that donors provide to developing countries for renewable energies. The additional flows (from the IRENA database) capture the flows to non-ODA Recipients in developing regions, flows from countries and institutions not currently reporting to the DAC and certain other types of flows, such as export credits. 
Energy access is a major development constraint in many developing countries and, while starting from a relatively low base, energy demand is expected to grow very rapidly in many of these countries in the future. This presents an opportunity for developing countries to utilize clean and renewable technologies to meet their future energy needs if they can gain access to the appropriate technologies and expertise. This indicator provides a suitable measure of the international support given to developing countries to access these technologies.
Data Sources and Collection Method
The OECD/DAC has been collecting data on official and private resource flows from 1960 at an aggregate level and 1973 at an activity level through the Creditor Reporting System (CRS data are considered complete from 1995 for commitments at an activity level and 2002 for disbursements). Data are reported on an annual calendar year basis by statistical reporters in national administrations (aid agencies, Ministries of Foreign Affairs or Finance, etc). 
IRENA’s data on financial flows from public sources in support of renewable energy are available in IRENA’s Public Renewable Energy Investment Database. IRENA collects this data from a wide range of publicly available sources, including the databases and annual reports of all of the main development finance institutions and 20 other bilateral and multilateral agencies investing in renewable energy. The database is updated annually and (at end-2016) covers public renewable energy investment flowing to 29 developed countries and 104 developing countries, for the period 2009-2015. As new publicly-funded financial institutions start investing in renewable energy, the IRENA database will expand to include these new investors over time.
Method of Computation and Other Methodological Considerations
Computation Method:
ODA and OOF are calculated by taking the total official flows from DAC member countries, multilateral organisations and other providers of development assistance to the sectors listed above. 
The IRENA (additional) flows are calculated by taking the total public investment flows from IRENA’s Public Renewable Energy Investment Database and excluding: domestic financial flows; international flows to countries outside developing regions; and flows reported by OECD (as described above). The flows are measured in current United States Dollars (USD). 
Comments and limitations:
Data in CRS are available from 1973. However, the data coverage is considered complete since 1995 for commitments at an activity level and 2002 for disbursements. At present, flows to clean energy research and development are only partially covered by the database and a few other areas (e.g. off-grid electricity supply, investments in improved cookstove projects) may be covered only partially. 
The IRENA database currently only covers financial institutions that have invested a total of USD 400 million or more in renewable energy. The process of continuous improvement of the database includes verifying the data against data produced by the multilateral development banks for climate finance reporting and by comparing the data with other independent reporting by international development finance agencies. 
Sub-indicator, alternative and additional indicators: N/A
Data Disaggregation
Data from OECD/DAC can be disaggregated by type of flow (ODA or OOF), by donor, recipient country, type of finance, type of aid (project, agriculture sub-sector, etc.). 
Data from IRENA can be disaggregated by technologies (i.e. bioenergy, geothermal energy, hydropower, ocean energy, solar energy, and wind energy) and sub-technologies (e.g. onshore and offshore wind), by geography (both at the country and regional level), by financial instrument and by type of recipient.
SDG 7: Energy

Energy is central to nearly every major challenge and opportunity the world faces today. Be it for jobs, security, climate change, food production or increasing incomes, access to energy for all is essential. Working towards this goal is especially important as it interlinks with other Sustainable Development Goals. Focusing on universal access to energy, increased energy efficiency and the increased use of renewable energy through new economic and job opportunities is crucial to creating more sustainable and inclusive communities and resilience to environmental issues like climate change.

At the current time, there are approximately 3 billion people who lack access to clean-cooking solutions and are exposed to dangerous levels of air pollution. Additionally, slightly less than 1 billion people are functioning without electricity and 50% of them are found in Sub-Saharan Africa alone. Fortunately, progress has been made in the past decade regarding the use of renewable electricity from water, solar and wind power and the ratio of energy used per unit of GDP is also declining.

However, the challenge is far from being solved and there needs to be more access to clean fuel and technology and more progress needs to be made regarding integrating renewable energy into end-use applications in buildings, transport and industry. Public and private investments in energy also need to be increased and there needs to be more focus on regulatory frameworks and innovative business models to transform the worlds energy systems.



13% of the global population still lacks access to modern electricity.
3 billion people rely on wood, coal, charcoal or animal waste for cooking and heating
Energy is the dominant contributor to climate change, accounting for around 60 per cent of total global greenhouse gas emissions.
Indoor air pollution from using combustible fuels for household energy caused 4.3 million deaths in 2012, with women and girls accounting for 6 out of every 10 of these.
The share of renewable energy in final energy consumption has reached 17.5% in 2015.
Goal 7 targets

ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and technology, including renewable energy, energy efficiency and advanced and cleaner fossil-fuel technology, and promote investment in energy infrastructure and clean energy technology expand infrastructure and upgrade technology for supplying modern and sustainable energy services for all in developing countries, in particular least developed countries, small island developing States, and land-locked developing countries, in accordance with their respective programmes of support

If people worldwide switched to energy efficient lightbulbs, the world would save $120 billion annually
AFFORDABLE AND CLEAN ENERGY: WHY IT MATTERS
To ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.
Our everyday lives depend on reliable and affordable energy services to function smoothly and to develop equitably.
A well-established energy system supports all sectors: from businesses, medicine and education to agriculture,
infrastructure, communications and high-technology. Conversely, lack of access to energy supplies and transformation systems is a constraint to human and economic development.
I have access to electricity. Why should I care about this goal?
For many decades, fossil fuels such as coal, oil or gas have been major sources of electricity production, but burning carbon fuels produces large amounts of greenhouse gases which cause climate change and have harmful impacts on peoples well-being and the environment. This affects everyone, not just a few. Moreover, global electricity use is rising rapidly. In a nutshell, without a stable electricity supply, countries will not be able to power their economies.
How many people are living without electricity?
Just under 1 billion people of the worlds population do not have access to electricity. 16 out of 20 countries with the largest deficits in electricity access are in Africa.
Without electricity, women and girls have to spend hours fetching water, clinics cannot store vaccines for children, many schoolchildren cannot do homework at night, and people cannot run competitive businesses. The health and well-being of some 3 billion people are adversely impacted by the lack of clean cooking fuels, such as wood, charcoal, dung and coal, which causes indoor air pollution.
What would it cost to switch to more sustainable energy?
The world needs to triple its investment in sustainable energy infrastructure per year, from around $400 billion now to $1.25 trillion by 2030.
Regions with the greatest energy deficits Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asianeed our help to improve energy access. That includes pushing harder to find clean, efficient, and affordable alternatives to health-damaging cook stoves.
Countries can accelerate the transition to an affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy system by investing in renewable energy resources, prioritizing energy efficient practices, and adopting clean energy technologies and infrastructure.
Businesses can maintain and protect ecosystems to be able to use and further develop hydropower sources of electricity and bioenergy, and commit to sourcing 100% of operational electricity needs from renewable sources.
Employers can reduce the internal demand for transport by prioritizing telecommunications and incentivize less energy intensive modes such as train travel over auto and air travel.
Investors can invest more in sustainable energy services, bringing new technologies to the market quickly from a diverse supplier base.
You can save electricity by plugging appliances into a power strip and turning them off completely when not in use, including your computer. You can also bike, walk or take public transport to reduce carbon emissions.

Goal 7. Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all
Energy is crucial for achieving almost all of the Sustainable Development Goals, from its role in the eradication of poverty through advancements in health, education, water supply and industrialization, to combating climate change. The proportion of the global population with access to electricity has increased steadily, from 79 per cent in 2000 to 85 per cent in 2012. Still, 1.1 billion people are without this valuable service. Recent global progress in this area has been driven largely by Asia, where access is expanding at more than twice the pace of demographic growth. Of those gaining access to electricity worldwide since 2010, 80 per cent are urban dwellers. The proportion of the worlds population with access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking increased from 51 per cent in 2000 to 58 per cent in 2014, although there has been limited progress since 2010. The absolute number of people relying on polluting fuels and technologies for cooking, such as solid fuels and kerosene, however, has actually increased, reaching an estimated three billion people. Limited progress since 2010 falls substantially short of global population growth and is almost exclusively confined to urban areas. The share of renewable energy (derived from hydropower, solid and liquid biofuels, wind, the sun, biogas, geothermal and marine sources, and waste) in the worlds total final energy consumption has increased slowly, from 17.4 per cent in 2000 to 18.1 per cent in 2012. More telling is the fact that modern renewable energy consumption, which excludes solid biofuels used for traditional purposes, grew rapidly, at a rate of 4 per cent a year between 2010 and 2012, and accounted for 60 per cent of all new power-generating capacity in 2014. In absolute terms, about 72 per cent of the increase in energy consumption from modern renewable sources between 2010 and 2012 came from developing regions, mostly from Eastern Asia. The technologies making the largest contribution have been hydropower, wind and solar energy; together they account for 73 per cent of the total increase in modern renewable energy between 2010 and 2012. Energy intensity, calculated by dividing total primary energy supply by GDP, reveals how much energy is used to produce one unit of economic output. Globally, energy intensity decreased by 1.7 per cent per year from 2010 to 2012. This represents a considerable improvement over the period from 1990 to 2010, when it decreased by 1.2 per cent a year. As a result, global energy intensity, which stood at 6.7 (millijoules (mJ) per 2011 United States dollar ppp) in 2000 fell to 5.7 by 2012. The proportion of the worlds energy use covered by mandatory energy efficiency regulation, which has almost doubled over the past decade, from 14 per cent in 2005 to 27 per cent in 2014, was a factor. Still, current progress is only about two thirds of the pace needed to double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency. Among end-use sectors, industry was the largest contributor to reduced energy intensity, followed closely by transportation. About 68 per cent of the savings in energy intensity between 2010 and 2012 came from developing regions, with Eastern Asia as the largest contributor. 
Goal 7. Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all
Progress in every area of sustainable energy falls short of what is needed to achieve energy access for all and to meet targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency. Meaningful improvements will require higher levels of financing and bolder policy commitments, together with the willingness of countries to embrace new technologies on a much wider scale.
		Globally, 85.3 per cent of the population had access to electricity in 2014, an increase of only 0.3 percentage points since 2012. That means that 1.06 billion people, predominantly rural dwellers, still function without electricity. Half of those people live in sub-Saharan Africa. 
		Access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking climbed to 57.4 per cent in 2014, up slightly from 56.5 per cent in 2012. More than 3 billion people, the majority of them in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, are still cooking without clean fuels and more efficient technologies.
		The share of renewable energy in final energy consumption grew modestly from 2012 to 2014, from 17.9 per cent to 18.3 per cent. Most of the increase was from renewable electricity from water, solar and wind power. Solar and wind power still make up a relatively minor share of energy consumption, despite their rapid growth in recent years. The challenge is to increase the share of renewable energy in the heat and transport sectors, which together account for 80 per cent of global energy consumption. 
		From 2012 to 2014, three quarters of the worlds 20 largest energy-consuming countries had reduced their energy intensity  the ratio of energy used per unit of GDP. The reduction was driven mainly by greater efficiencies in the industry and transport sectors. However, that progress is still not sufficient to meet the target of doubling the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency. 
Goal 7. Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all
Ensuring access to affordable, reliable and modern energy for all has come one step closer as a result of recent progress in increased access to electricity, in particular in the least developed countries, and improvements in industrial energy efficiency. However, national priorities and policy ambitions to deliver energy for all continue to be needed, to put the world on track to meet the energy targets for 2030.From 2000 to 2016, the proportion of the global population with access to electricity increased from 78 per cent to 87 per cent, with the absolute number of people living without access to electricity dipping to just below 1 billion.Access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking has gradually improved, to reach 59 per cent globally in 2016, up 10 percentage points since 2000. Even with this progress, 3 billion people are still cooking with polluting fuel and stove combinations. Key barriers to increased access include high user costs for many of the cleaner cooking solutions, limited infrastructure, lack of consumer awareness of the benefits of clean cooking and limited financing for producers seeking to enter the clean fuel and stove markets. Renewable energy consumption increased to 17.5 per cent in 2015, up slightly from 17.3 per cent in 2014 as the growth in renewables outpaced the growth in overall energy consumption. Most of the increase came from bioenergy and the continued expansion of wind and solar energy, driven by falling costs and policy support. Reducing energy intensity (the ratio of energy used per unit of GDP) is crucial for offsetting carbon dioxide emissions and making energy more affordable. Global energy intensity decreased by 2.8 per cent in 2015 from 2014, double the rate of improvement seen from 1990 to 2010. To reach the Sustainable Development Goal target, global energy intensity needs to improve at an annual rate of 2.7 per cent over the period 20162030, necessitating a significant ramp-up in global policy ambition to keep up the momentum.Goal 7.
