Classifiers

Sources:
A) SDG website
B) 3 SG Reports on SG progress (section for each SDG)
C) HLPF report on the SDG  (incomplete set - not using)

1) cl_base includes only A+B (Original. Used for the DESA WP as "sdg-pre-hlpf")
2) cl_ehandbook includes A+B+D
3) cl_base_plus includes A+B+E
4) cl_jumbo includes A+B+D+C  (no hlpf until we have all 17 reports)


5) cl_base_plus_alt attempts to rebalance SDG 13 to reduce the excessive language on political processes that leads to over correlation with the WPSR. This is a testing exercise to inform the selection of classifier sources.
6) cl_extreme does as much as possible to achieve best results. Text is manually edited to try to keep only relevant and unique text
7) cl_large is #5 plus ESCAP's sources. Does well and has smaller off-diagonal errors. Contender for best classifier (between #5 and #7)
8) cl_base_new is cl_base-plus-alt together with SDG text from SG Progress Report (G)
9) cl_sdg is cl_base_new with ESCAP source. 
10) cl_nounsadj is cl_base_new with only nouns and adjectives after processing
