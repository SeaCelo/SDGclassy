Classifiers

Sources:
A) SDG website
B) 3 SG Reports on SG progress (section for each SDG)
C) HLPF report on the SDG  (incomplete set - not using)
D) E-handbook from statistics
E) Targets+indicators text (from here: unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/indicators-list/)


1) cl_base includes only A+B (Original. Used for the DESA WP as "sdg-pre-hlpf")
2) cl_ehandbook includes A+B+D
3) cl_base-plus includes A+B+E
4) cl_jumbo includes A+B+D+C  (no hlpf until we have all 17 reports)


5) cl_base-plus-alt attempts to rebalance SDG 13 to reduce the excessive language on political processes that leads to over correlation with the WPSR. This is a testing exercise to inform the selection of classifier sources.
6) cl_extreme does as much as possible to achieve best results. Text is manually edited to try to keep only relevant and unique text
