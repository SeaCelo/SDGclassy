Concept Paper 
Partnership dialogue 4: Making fisheries sustainable 
 
Concept paper for the partnership dialogue 4, prepared in response to the General Assembly resolution 70/303 on making fisheries sustainable, is covering SDG targets 14.4 and 14.6. The concept paper for this partnership dialogue is based on inputs received from Member States, the UN system and other stakeholders. Given the word limit for the concept paper, not all inputs have been included in their entirety, but they can be accessed under: https://oceanconference.un.org/documents. 
I. Introduction 
More than 3 billion people rely on fish for an important source of animal protein, and 300 million people rely on marine fisheries for their livelihoods. In developing and developed countries alike, the consumption of fish is increasing both per capita and in absolute terms. 
II. Status and trends 
Total capture production in marine waters was 81.5 million tonnes in 2014, a slight increase on the previous two years, with 13 out of the 25 major fishing countries increasing their catches by more than 100,000 tonnes compared with 2013.1 According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation’s (FAO) analysis of assessed commercial fish stocks, the share of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels decreased from 90 percent in 1974 to 69 percent in 2013.2 Overfishing, including discards, destructive fishing practices, and “ghost fishing” killing fish with discarded or lost equipment leads to a loss of US$80 billion annually in potential revenue.3

Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, a severe stress on global fisheries, is responsible for roughly 11 to 26 million tons of fish catches and US$10-22 billion in
revenue.4 Although emphasis is often put on IUU fishing activities occurring in areas under national jurisdiction, IUU fishing on the high seas is a serious concern.

Aquaculture production, a rapidly growing sector, currently provides half of the fish products covered in global statistics and in this regard States and regions should be encouraged to have effective governance and regulatory arrangements in support to sustainable development. 
 
Fish and fisheries are important to livelihoods and food security and nutrition. It is estimated that fish accounts for 17 percent animal protein and 6.7 percent of all protein consumed globally. Many millions of people around the world find a source of income and livelihood in the fisheries and aquaculture sector. Estimates indicate that 56.6 million people were engaged in the primary sector of capture fisheries and aquaculture. In 2014, small scale fisheries provide work to 90 percent of the people employed in capture fisheries5.  
 
These trends take place against the backdrop of climate change. Warming oceans are changing the behaviour of fish stocks, generally pushing them toward the poles and to deeper water, and also are changing the metabolic rates, range and productivity of some species. Sea level rise endangers mangroves and sea-grasses that protect coastal fisheries, and coral bleaching and other climate change-induced natural phenomena threaten the fish stocks that depend on reefs for survival.  
 
Recognizing the urgency of the situation, States, individually and through regional fisheries management organizations or arrangements (RFMO/As), are working to restore fisheries, taking the precautionary approach when complete data is not available. They are developing conservation and management measures to reduce overfishing through science-based management plans and harvest regulation, and through regulations, policies and tools to address IUU fishing and destructive fishing practices.  
 
The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which sets out the legal framework within which all activities in the oceans and seas must be carried out, sets of the rights and duties of States in the different maritime zones for the conservation and management of marine living resources. The rights over fisheries in UNCLOS are accompanied by concordant obligations to conserve and manage fish stocks, for example, by requiring coastal States to determine the total allowable catch of the living resources in their exclusive economic zones and to cooperate in the case of shared stocks and contiguous areas. Collaboration among States also takes place at the global level in accordance with other international instruments supporting sustainable fisheries, including  both binding and voluntary commitments e.g. the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement (Fish Stocks Agreement), the FAO Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing (PSMA) and the FAO’s Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries and related instruments, as well as through regional agreements and organizations. Nationals of other States fishing within the EEZ are required to comply with the conservation measures and other terms and conditions established by the coastal State. Similarly, the right of vessels from all States to fish on the high seas is accompanied by an obligation for States to take, or cooperate with other States in taking, measures for their respective nationals necessary for the conservation of the living resources of the high seas and to cooperate with each other in the conservation and management of such resources.Similarly, the right of vessels from all States to fish on the high seas is accompanied by an obligation for States to take, or cooperate with other States in taking, measures for their respective nationals necessary for the conservation of the living resources of the high seas and to cooperate with each other in the conservation and management of such resources.
 
UNCLOS also requires cooperation in the conservation and management of straddling and highly migratory fish stocks.  This duty to cooperate is given effect to and elaborated upon through an implementing agreement to UNCLOS– the Fish Stocks Agreement. However, the provisions of UNCLOS and the Fish Stocks Agreement relating to the conservation and management of fish stocks are not fully implemented, as overfishing, IUU fishing and destructive fishing practices continue to challenge the sustainability of fisheries around the world. 
 
While the overall trend in the sustainability of fisheries is overwhelmingly negative, some progress has been made with regard to the sustainability of some stocks, particularly through effective regulation and monitoring. A number of actions are being taken to improve the sustainability of stocks, including through increasing understanding of resources and the ecosystems they inhabit, strengthening institutions responsible for the management of fisheries, improving regulatory regimes, increasing compliance and addressing economic and social factors which contribute to overfishing. Increasing attention is also being paid to improving the overall health and resilience of marine ecosystems to maintain and improve their yield in the face of increasing anthropogenic stressors.  
 
Significant progress has been made in the identification of vulnerable marine ecosystem (VME) indicator species, and in the development of conservation and management measures (CMMs) to protect these ecosystems, including those of bottom fisheries and deep-sea fish stocks. The measures include thresholds levels for VME indicator species, move-on rules and temporary or permanent closures, closed areas (including those with vulnerable ecosystems), restrictions on vessel types and time spent fishing, restrictions on legal mesh sizes and the size of fish that can be caught, restrictions on bycatch, catch and effort reporting, gear restrictions, measures for exploratory fisheries, precautionary catch limits, and prohibitions on directed fishing.  RFMO/As and States are cooperating on marine scientific research and data collection and capacity-building activities for developing States.6

Subsidies and other types of support measures to the fishing industry are granted for a variety of purposes. In many cases, they are not directed at increasing fishing capacity or effort as such. They can, if properly designed: support crew safety; support processing by local populations; enable value addition; facilitate the establishment of fish stocks management systems; finance less harmful fishing methods; and promote the adoption of more sustainable technologies and therefore provide for the restoration and rehabilitation of ecosystems. On the other hand, many fisheries subsidies actively contribute to overcapacity and depletion of fish stocks, and subsidies can be damaging and trade distorting even in effectively managed fisheries. Subsidies that encourage overcapacity and overfishing result in losses for States, and those losses are often borne by communities dependent on fishery resources for their livelihood and food security and by taxpayers.livelihood and food security and by taxpayers.livelihood and food security and by taxpayers.

Data on subsidies are subject to debate. Several direct estimates of subsidies and financial transfers to the fisheries sector have been made, with a 2016 study placing total subsidies at about US$35 billion in 2009 dollars, of which US$ 20 billion is categorised as harmful or capacity enhancing subsidies that contribute to overcapacity and overfishing.8 Between 60 and 80 percent of the total global subsidy is provided by developed countries.  
 
After more than 16 years of negotiations in the World Trade Organisation (WTO), there is still no multilateral framework to regulate fisheries subsidies. WTO Members recently entered a period of renewed activity, with Members, including the EU, the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group and a collection of Latin American States, submitting new proposals. In addition to the WTO negotiations, other international and regional initiatives have been advanced over the past two years. At the WTO's 10th Ministerial Conference in December 2015, a group of 26 WTO Members issued a joint statement calling to prohibit subsidies that contribute to overfishing and overcapacity, and subsidies linked to IUU fishing, in line with SDG Target 14.6. In September 2016, a group of 12 WTO Members launched an initiative to prohibit harmful subsidies through plurilateral negotiations in the WTO. 
 
Some governments are starting to introduce national reforms to reduce subsidies that could contribute to overfishing and overcapacity and to shift support toward more sustainable and less harmful activities. 
 
The adoption of target 14.6 also has stimulated multilateral agencies, individual countries, civil society and academia to further address the issue of subsidies. In the global policy setting, the General Assembly (UNGA), in its resolution 69/109 recalled, inter alia, that in “The future we want”. States reaffirmed their commitment in the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation to eliminate subsidies that contribute to IUU fishing and overcapacity, taking into account the importance of that sector to developing countries and reiterated their commitment to conclude multilateral disciplines on fisheries subsidies. In July 2016, an initiative, led by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), FAO, and the United Nations Environment Programme (UN Environment) was launched. The initiative, known as “the road map,” calls for ending harmful fishing subsidies and delivering on trade-related targets under SDG 14. UNCTAD, FAO and UN Environment also held an Oceans Forum in Geneva in March 2017 to discuss the implementation of the road map and preparations for the UN Oceans Conference. Further, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is currently revising and expanding its database on support measures to fisheries with the explicit objective of supporting international objectives such as SDG 14.6 Moreover,  target 14.6 reflects many of the same elements agreed upon under Aichi Biodiversity Target 6 on sustainable fisheries, which was adopted by the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in 2010 as part of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets. 
 
III. Challenges and opportunities 
 
Globally there is an opportunity for ‘rebuilding’ depleted fisheries including greater action on preventing, deterring and eliminating IUU fishing, decreasing fishing pressure and increasing environmental safeguards. 
 
The ecosystem approach to fisheries management has been recognised in many parts of the world as an integral component in achieving sustainable fisheries while dealing with the increasingly complex challenges facing oceans and coastal zone development. This requires participation, collaboration, and continuous development and sharing of knowledge between sectors to achieve sustainable and adaptive management cycles. The socioeconomic valuation of management alternatives is a critical part of this approach. Implementation of the ecosystem approach to fisheries needs to be strengthened at the national and regional level. Further dialogue is needed to exchange experiences and to identify appropriate management instruments for the implementation of the ecosystem approach at different levels. 
 
The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), on an annual basis, considers and reviews developments relating to sustainable fisheries and ocean affairs and the law of the sea, as the global institution having the competence to undertake such a review. In this context, the UNGA has played a central normative and policy-setting role through its resolutions, including in relation to fisheries. It has taken numerous actions to strengthen the implementation of UNCLOS and the Fish Stock Agreement and has also addressed specific concerns, such as large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing on the high seas and unauthorized fishing in zones of national jurisdiction. More recently, the UNGA has undertaken a process to consider measures to address the adverse impacts of bottom fishing on vulnerable marine ecosystems and the long-term sustainability of deep sea fish stocks, which has triggered important actions by States, RFMO/As and the FAO. In 2016, the UNGA conducted a further review of the actions taken by States and RFMO/As, preceded by a two-day workshop, and a number of concrete recommendations were included in the latest General Assembly resolution on sustainable fisheries as a result of this process.  
 
A number of the UNGA processes have also addressed sustainable fisheries, including the United Nations Open-ended Informal Consultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the Sea. The Ad Hoc Working Group of the Whole on the Regular Process for Global Reporting and Assessment of the State of the Marine Environment, including Socioeconomic Aspects recently oversaw the completion of the First Global Integrated Marine Assessment referred to earlier. This Assessment examines, inter alia, the status of the world’s fisheries, as well as their socioeconomic aspects, and can serve as a tool for informed decision-making at all levels.  
 
The Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, adopted by the FAO Conference in 1995 and its related instruments provide a robust framework for national and international efforts, including in the formulation of policies and other legal and institutional frameworks and instruments, to ensure sustainable fishing and use of aquatic living resources in harmony with the environment. 
 
The Voluntary Guidelines for Securing Sustainable Small-Scale Fisheries in the Context of Food Security and Poverty Eradication (SSF Guidelines), complementing the Code of Conduct and endorsed by the FAO Committee on Fisheries (COFI) in 2014, represent a global consensus on principles and guidance for small-scale fisheries governance and development towards enhanced food security and nutrition. They aim to contribute to and improve the equitable development and socio-economic condition of small-scale fishing communities alongside sustainable and responsible management of fisheries. There is already evidence of important steps in implementation of the SSF Guidelines as there is increasing recognition of the need to address small-scale fisheries in a way commensurate with the reality of small-scale fishing communities and of the importance of participatory human rights based approaches. 
 
The Review Conference on the Fish Stocks Agreement was convened in 2006, and reconvened in 2010 and 2016 to assess the effectiveness of the Agreement in securing the conservation and management of straddling and highly migratory fish stocks by reviewing the adequacy of its provisions and, if necessary, proposing means of strengthening the implementation of those provisions. The recommendations adopted by the Review Conference have stimulated concrete actions by States to improve the sustainability of high seas fisheries, including through the General Assembly, FAO and RFMO/As.  
 
Efforts to address overfishing, non-compliance and effective implementation of regulations and management frameworks will continue to be challenged and in some cases, undermined, by factors such as lack of science-based management, weak governance and institutional capacities, low data collection and analysis and monitoring capacity.  
 
Measures to combat IUU fishing include the creation and maintenance of IUU lists, catch documentation and supply chain traceability programs, and inspection and surveillance schemes. The coming into force and implementation PSMA is expected to be a major advance in combating IUU fishing globally. Effective implementation of the PSMA will reduce the incentive to engage in IUU fishing and block fishery products derived from such activities from entering national and international markets. The PSMA recognizes the need for assistance to developing countries to adopt and implement port State measures and requires Parties to cooperate to establish appropriate funding mechanisms to assist developing States in the implementation of the Agreement. 
 
Financing gaps, including for sustainable management; monitoring, control and enforcement; stock assessment; capacity building and for the introduction and scaling up of marine seafood (wild catch and aquaculture) as well as greening seafood supply chains including through certification schemes which provide opportunities to ensure environmental sustainability while creating market access, continue to pose challenges.  
 
Challenges in relation to fisheries subsidies include: fragmented and non-comparable information on State support practices relating to the fisheries sector; lack of official and reliable data on fisheries subsidies (including lack of proper notification to WTO); lack of consensus on how to deal with basic concepts and definitions, including on what constitutes "harmful" fisheries subsidies; lack of agreement on how to create incentives for all nations with important fishing interests to fully engage in the negotiations; low level of knowledge and understanding of the main international instruments covering fisheries within members of the trade community, leading to lack of coordination and coherence between some trade negotiation officials and fisheries management agencies, resulting in unclear or contradictory policy positions;  problems in defining content, sequencing and limits of special and differential treatment provisions to be included in new disciplines; lack of international agreement on how to address the interests and needs of traditional fisheries communities in fisheries subsidies disciplines; and on whether this should apply to both developing and developed countries. Many of these issues have been addressed through stakeholder consultations, analysis and the development of technical solutions that can be built upon further. Additionally, while the importance of the issue of fuel subsidies is widely acknowledged, the possibility to develop consensus approaches to such subsidies has been hampered both by the technical complexity of the issue and by political sensitivities. 
 
It would be important to achieve a successful outcome at the WTO's Ministerial meeting in December 2017, so that the WTO can positively contribute to the 2030 Agenda by meeting the 2020 deadline set in target 14.6. In doing so, the development and livelihood needs of developing countries, LDCs and SIDS need to be taken into consideration. It is also important to encourage the implementation of fisheries subsidies provisions in other trade agreements, including at the regional and bilateral level, in a manner that contributes to SDG 14.6. As such, a need persists to build coherence and structured dialogue between the trade community, the environmental communities and the fisheries management communities. 
 
National governments, when undertaking internal reforms, should be encouraged to consider SDG 14.6, regardless of whether there is advancement at the multilateral level. Existing fisheries subsidies could be redirected to support fisheries management, educate communities, among other beneficial effects.  
 
In addition to global and national action, in line with the ecosystem approach, sub-regional and regional cooperation is an absolute necessity for sustainable management of fisheries and effective implementation of the relevant SDGs targets. 
 
Strengthening the effectiveness of reporting, monitoring, and surveillance of fisheries subsidies at global, regional and national levels could be an important underpinning to fisheries subsidies negotiations and reform. Capacity building and the provision of technical assistance plays an important role in the implementation and realisation of SDGs targets 14.4 and 14.6 including in this instance, in the regulation of trade in fisheries. 
IV. Existing partnerships  
A great number of partnerships cover various aspects of fisheries. More than 30 partnerships were mentioned in submissions put forward for the conference,9 involving a range of stakeholders and modalities. 
9 See http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org. 
10 Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Tuvalu. 
 
As a first form of partnerships, groups of countries are cooperating to jointly manage their fisheries. An often-quoted example is that of the Vessel Day Scheme (VDS) currently being implemented by Pacific Islands countries who are Parties to the Nauru Agreement (PNA).  The VDS allows SIDS to benefit from the tuna resources in their jurisdictions. The eight signatories10 to the Agreement collectively control 25–30% of the world's tuna supply and approximately 60% of the western and central Pacific tuna supply. Joint fishery management arrangements made by the PNA have been concerned mainly with the management of tuna purse-seine fishing in the tropical western Pacific. Recent actions by the PNA include a prohibition on setting purse-seine nets around whale sharks, a ban on fishing near fish aggregation devices during some periods of the year, a requirement for 100% observer coverage aboard purse-seiners, a minimum mesh-size, and a requirement for retention of all catch of tuna on board. PNA-specific measures are also supplemented by the Harmonized Minimum Terms and Conditions for Access to the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA) member EEZs by Foreign Fishing Vessels, agreed by all FFA member countries including the PNA. These terms and conditions apply to all foreign fishing vessels, not just purse-seiners, and include a requirement for an Automatic Location Communicator to be switched on at all times and reporting to the regional Vessel Monitoring System, minimum standards for reporting to national authorities, and a requirement for annual regional vessel registration. 
 
Another type of partnership is broad-based in terms of issues and involves national Governments and other stakeholders. For example, the Coral Triangle Initiative on Coral Reefs, Fisheries and Food Security has six country member states (Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, Timor-Leste) and development partners including the US and Australian Governments, the Asian Development Bank, the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and non-governmental organisations such as World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), the Nature Conservancy, Conservation International (CI) and the Coral Triangle Centre. The partnership has been expanded to include universities and regional organisations, and platforms have been established to engage with the private sector, to empower women and strengthen local governments. The partnership has a 2020 Regional Plan of Action that addresses fisheries management in relation to ecosystem approaches, along with conservation, marine protection and climate change adaptation issues. 
11 See http://www.coraltriangleinitiative.org/ 
 
The advantages of closer coordination and synergizing between regional and international organisations have also become apparent. An example is the cooperation between regional seas conventions and action plans and regional fisheries bodies, such as the OSPAR-NEAFC collective arrangement and the MAP-GFCM Memorandum of Understanding, which prove to be useful in advancing ecosystem approaches. At the global level, the Secretariat of the CBD, UN Environment, FAO and others are working to facilitate improved dialogue and collaboration across regional mechanisms through the Sustainable Ocean Initiative (SOI) Global Dialogues with Regional Seas Organisations and Regional Fishery Bodies on Accelerating Progress Towards the Aichi Biodiversity Targets and the SDGs, sponsored by the Republic of Korea, Japan and the European Commission. Through joint capacity building activities, CITES has established special cooperation and partnerships agreements through resolutions or memoranda of understanding with other international organizations and agreements to address issues related to management of CITES-listed marine species. Joint efforts are also being undertaken through FAO and CBD to provide improved guidance and support to countries in achieving, and reporting progress on, towards global goals on sustainable fisheries and biodiversity. 
 
United Nations organizations are also involved in partnerships with other stakeholders. For instance, the Global Sustainable Fisheries Management and Biodiversity Conservation in the Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction Programme (Common Oceans). This programme was approved by the GEF under the lead of FAO in close collaboration with the UN Environment and the World Bank.  Other partners include Conservation International, Global Oceans Forum, IUCN and WWF. Additional partners include RFMOs, ISSF, NOAA, BirdLife International, the FFA, OSPESCA, and PNA. Focusing on tuna and deep-sea fisheries, capacity building and ocean partnerships, in parallel with the conservation of biodiversity, the Common Oceans Program aims to promote efficient and sustainable management of fisheries resources and biodiversity conservation in ABNJ to achieve the global targets agreed in international fora. 
 
There are currently a number of partnerships supporting the implementation of PSMA, which include States, inter-governmental organisations, NGOs, regional fishery bodies, and others. FAO has recently formulated a global capacity development umbrella programme on Support for the implementation of the PSMA and complementary instruments to combat IUU fishing. This five-year programme is country led and aims to enhance the capacity of developing countries in combatting IUU fishing, by strengthening their policy, legal and operational frameworks in line with the PSMA and other relevant international instruments and regional schemes. The establishment of an appropriate funding mechanism under Article 21 of PSMA will assist developing States efforts in implementing the Agreement. 
 
International NGOs have worked to support developing countries to manage their fisheries and are also spearheading partnerships in relation to the social and environmental issues around fisheries, and on sustainable consumption and production in relation to fish and marine products. For example, in 2014, CI initiated a year-long effort, coordinating a global research group from academic institutions, industry and non-profit organizations  to identify the major social issues associated with the global seafood industry. CI is also part of the Coalition for Socially Responsible Seafood, which gathers several non-profit organizations, non-governmental organizations, academic research institutions, bilateral development agencies, and business partners. 
 
Apart from the innovative initiative launched at UNCTAD 14 and currently being spearheaded by FAO, UNCTAD and UN Environment12, very few partnerships focusing on harmful fisheries subsidies seem to exist. There does not seem also to exist studies documenting the effectiveness and impact of existing partnerships in this area as a whole (i.e. beyond individual partnerships). 
12 See: Paragraph 16 above. 
V. Possible areas of new partnerships  
The following areas were indicated as promising for the development of new partnerships in submissions made for the preparatory process of the conference: 
 
(i) Partnerships with resource users such as small-scale fishing organisations, including support to their capacity development to allow them to effectively participate in governance and development processes; 
(ii) Public-private partnerships can promote the development of infrastructure and technical innovation with respect to sustainable fisheries management;  
(iii) International NGOs are working with the fishing industry in developing countries to help them achieve certification standards, such as Marine Stewardship Council, address IUU fishing, and establish sustainable domestic and international supply chains; 
(iv) Partnership among UN Agencies and stakeholders working on marine ecosystems;  
(v) Partnerships between UN organizations, academic institutions and research centres to promote the development of assessment methods and harvest strategies;  
(vi) Potential for increased regional research collaboration; 
(vii) Partnerships with relevant national authorities, UN Agencies, RFMOs, regional organizations and NGOs working to combat IUU fishing; 
(viii) Partnerships to promote awareness of and capacity-building aimed at improving implementation of the international legal framework for sustainable fisheries, including as contained in UNCLOS and the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement;  
(ix) Opportunities for strengthening collaboration at the regional level, including between RFMOs, Regional Seas conventions, where appropriate, and the broader Regional Economic Communities such as the ASEAN, CARICOM, SADC, and also IOC by linking fisheries management to cross management instruments such as marine spatial planning including through global level dialogue across regional mechanisms;  
(x) Possibility of promoting better links across the EU yellow/red flag system, CITES Appendices and US Fish and Wildlife Service ESA-listed species criteria, to enhance understanding of thresholds for fisheries sanctions and thresholds for threatened fisheries provisions; 
(xi) Partnerships for development and updating of global data standards for fisheries and aquaculture;  
(xii) Partnerships to enhance the sharing of information, experiences and good practices on the implementation of sustainable fisheries standards (e.g. FLUX standard), which will contribute to internationally harmonized processes for sustainable fishery management; 
(xiii) Partnerships between relevant UN organizations and international development institutions to study fisheries value chains and use of sustainability standards;  
(xiv) At the national level, partnerships including private sector actors could support governments to identify harmful subsidies targeted in Target 14.6 and document their ecological and socio-economic impacts on economies, fisheries, and international markets. Partnerships with national statistical offices and relevant fisheries bodies could help improve reporting of subsidies to address data gaps; 
(xv) Deeper cooperation between UN agencies, trade agencies, and other organizations to gather and analyse existing data on fisheries subsidies and public support measures; 
(xvi) Partnerships between UN agencies to support countries in their effort to reform trade policies including fisheries subsidies;  
(xvii) In order to foster advances in international negotiations at WTO, it was proposed to foster partnerships with regional initiatives and entities (including regional fishery bodies), especially those incorporating developing countries and SIDS, to assist them in better understanding the issues at stake and providing necessary inputs to the negotiations; 
(xviii) It was suggested that the GEF in its next phase (2018-22), should aim to explicitly include provision for financial support to developing countries for technical assistance and capacity building to help them incorporate new rules on fisheries subsidies into relevant national and regional policy and legislation, and build capacity for monitoring, compliance and enforcement; 
(xix) The strengthening of the existing partnerships, building on existing cooperation platforms, such as existing cooperation between Regional Seas and RFMOs, existing Science-Policy Interface Platforms, and Informal Cooperation Platforms between regional, international bodies, NGOs and business could be envisioned, with a specific focus on SDG14 targets related to sustainable fisheries management. 
VI. Guiding questions for the dialogue  
• How can successful multi-country and multi-stake-holder’s partnerships focusing on fisheries management be replicated or advanced?  

• In progressing the implementation of target 14.6 at national, regional and global level, what type of partnerships could be put in place to: a. curb IUU fishing on the high seas and in situations where monitoring and surveillance capacity is limited? or 

b. address harmful fisheries subsidies?  




• What role could partnerships play to address overfishing, including through the development and implementation of science-based management plans, in order to restore fish stocks in the shortest time feasible, at least to levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield as determined by their biological characteristics?  

• How can businesses be more involved and stakeholder cooperation in general, be increased to facilitate designs of innovative systems, techniques and practises to achieve sustainable fisheries?
