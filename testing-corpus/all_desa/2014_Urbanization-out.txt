Since 1988 the Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the united_nations has been issuing approximately every two years revised and updated estimates and projections of the urban and rural populations of all countries in the world and of their major urban agglomerations. This note presents the main findings of the 2014 Revision of World Urbanization Prospects which are consistent with the size of the total population of each country as estimated or projected in the 2012 Revision of World Population Prospects (united_nations, 2013a).
The 2014 Revision presents estimates and projections of the total, urban and rural populations of the world for the period 1950-2050. The results are shown for development groups, six major areas (i.e., Africa, Asia, Europe, latin_america and the Caribbean, Northern America and Oceania), income groups and 21 regions. Data are further presented for the 233 countries or areas of the world. The 2014 Revision also provides estimates and projections of the population of urban agglomerations with 300,000 inhabitants or more in 2014 for the period 1950-2030. Estimates of the proportion of the population living in urban areas and the population of cities are based on national statistics. Population censuses are the most commonly used sources of data on the proportion urban and the population of cities. However, in some countries, the data used as the basis for estimation are obtained from population registers or administrative statistics.
Globally, more people live in urban areas than in rural areas, with 54 per cent of the worlds population residing in urban areas in 2014. In 1950, 30 per cent of the worlds population was urban, and by 2050, 66 per cent of the worlds population is projected to be urban. There is significant diversity in the urbanization levels reached by different regions. The most urbanized regions include Northern America (82 per cent living in urban areas in 2014), latin_america and the Caribbean (80 per cent), and Europe (73 per cent). In contrast, Africa and Asia remain mostly rural, with 40 and 48 per cent of their respective populations living in urban areas. All regions are expected to urbanize further over the coming decades. Africa and Asia are urbanizing faster than the other regions and are projected to become 56 and 64 per cent urban, respectively, by 2050.
Close to half of the worlds urban dwellers reside in relatively small settlements of less than 500,000 inhabitants, while only around one in eight live in the 28 mega-cities with more than 10 million inhabitants. Several decades ago most of the worlds largest urban agglomerations were found in the more developed regions, but todays large cities are concentrated in the global South. The fastest growing urban agglomerations are medium-sized cities and cities with less than 1 million inhabitants located in Asia and Africa. As the world continues to urbanize, sustainable development challenges will be increasingly concentrated in cities, particularly in the lower-middleincome countries where the pace of urbanization is fastest. Integrated policies to improve the lives of both urban and rural dwellers are needed.
While the high income countries have been highly urbanized for several decades, upper-middle-income countries have experienced the fastest pace of urbanization since 1950. In the lower-middle-income countries the pace of urbanization has been slower. Nevertheless, this group of countries is expected to experience faster urbanization than others in the coming decades. In 2014, the proportion of the population living in urban areas was 39 per cent in lower-middle-income countries and 30 per cent in low-income countries. By 2050, these countries are expected to reach, on average, 57 per cent and 48 per cent urban, respectively.
Realization of these projections is contingent on the continuation of fertility reductions in the developing world. If fertility were to remain constant at current levels and the pace of urbanization remained that projected in the 2014 Revision, the world urban population would increase to 7.4 billion by 2050 instead of the 6.3 billion expected when fertility is assumed to continue declining in all developing regions. In many countries, natural increase (the difference of births minus deaths) accounts for about 60 per cent of urban population growth. Consequently, policies that facilitate the reduction of fertility by ensuring that couples have access to the modern contraception and that they can decide freely the number of children they desire can contribute to moderate increases in the number of urban dwellers, thereby making it easier for developing countries to adjust to the transformations associated with growing urbanization.

In todays increasingly global and interconnected world, over half of the worlds population (54 per cent) now lives in urban areas, up from 30 per cent in 1950. The coming decades will bring further profound changes to the size and spatial distribution of the global population such that the worlds population in 2050 is projected to be 66 per cent urban. The global urban population is projected to grow by 2.5 billion urban dwellers between 2014 and 2050, with nearly 90 per cent of the increase concentrated in Asia and Africa.
Trends in urbanization are integrally linked to sustainable development. With good planning and governance, the increasing concentration of people in urban settlements can facilitate economic and social development, while also offering opportunities to mitigate the adverse impact of consumption and production on the environment. However, rapid and unplanned urban growth threatens sustainable development when the necessary infrastructure is not developed or when policies are not implemented to protect the environment and ensure that the benefits of city life are equitably shared.
Accurate, consistent and timely data on global trends in urbanization and city growth is a key input to better assess current and future needs with respect to urban growth and to set policy priorities to promote inclusive and equitable urban and rural development. In order to systematically track levels and trends in urbanization around the world, the Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the united_nations has issued since 1988 biennial estimates and projections of the urban and rural populations of all countries in the world and of the populations of major urban agglomerations. This report presents the 2014 Revision of World Urbanization Prospects, which contains the latest estimates of the urban and rural populations of 233 countries or areas from 1950 to 2014 and projections to 2050. In addition, this report describes the estimates of the population size of all urban agglomerations with 300,000 inhabitants or more in 2014 from 1950 to 2014 and projections to 2030. Recognizing the importance of smaller cities and towns, this latest revision has expanded the number of cities and provides population estimates and projections for 1,692 urban settlements, compared to 633 in the 2011 Revision.
This introductory chapter of the report is presented in three sections. The first section offers some context for the global urban transition with a discussion of its associations with other demographic and economic shifts, and the implications for sustainable development. The second section gives a brief description of the data and methods used to estimate and project the urban and rural populations and the populations of cities (a complete technical description of the data and methods can be found at ) (united_nations, 2014a). The third section provides a roadmap for the chapters that comprise the remainder of this report.
A. URBANIZATION AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
The process of urbanization, or urban transition, describes a shift in a population from one that is dispersed across small rural settlements in which agriculture is the dominant economic activity towards one where the population is concentrated in larger, dense urban settlements characterised by industrial and service activities (Montgomery et al., 2004). Historically, the urban transition has been linked closely to economic development. In Europe and Northern America, rapid urbanization over the late-nineteenth and twentieth centuries was observed to accompany the industrial revolution and rapid economic growth. A similar, although generally weaker, association between urbanization, industrialization and economic development has been observed more recently in many parts of latin_america and the Caribbean and Eastern Asia as well.
The urban transition and economic growth have been linked in part because economic development fuels urbanization. People are drawn to cities that offer varied opportunities for education and employment, particularly in the industry and services sectors. Urbanization, in turn, generally has had a  positive impact on economic development and poverty reduction. Cities concentrate diverse pools of labour that businesses need in order to grow. Furthermore, the density of people and businesses in cities facilitates knowledge and information sharing, fostering new enterprises and technological innovation. As hubs of commerce, government, and transportation, cities provide crucial links with rural areas, between cities, and across international borders. Approximately 80 per cent of global gross domestic product (GDP) is generated in cities (Grubler and Fisk, 2013).
Recent trends in developing regions, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, have challenged long held notions about the association between urbanization and economic growth (Fay and Opal, 1999). While a dearth of data on urbanization in the region complicates any inference about trends (Satterthwaite, 2010), the available evidence suggests that the urbanization process continued in sub-Saharan Africa between the 1970s and 2000, despite economic contraction in the region over that period (united_nations, 2013b).
Demographers note that the urban transition observed in sub-Saharan Africa in recent decades, while not consistent with economic theories of urbanization, is consistent with the demographic transition experienced in the region (de Vries, 1990; Dyson, 2011). The demographic theory of the urban transition explains that in the pre-transition period characterized by high birth and death rates, the population is mostly rural and mortality rates in urban areas tend to be much higher than those in rural areas owing to the heightened risk of death from infectious diseases that spread easily in densely populated areas with poor sanitation. During this period, urban birth rates tend to be lower than urban death rates such that the urban population is sustained only by continuous replenishment through rural-to-urban migration. With improvements to public health, death rates begin to decline, faster in urban areas than in rural ones, and eventually the number of urban deaths falls below the number of urban births such that the urban population grows not only because of rural-to-urban migration, but due to natural increase as well. In most regions, including in sub-Saharan Africa, the process of urbanization has tended to occur in tandem with the declining mortality and fertility rates that characterize the demographic transition, lending support to the notion that the urban transition is better explained as a demographic phenomenon than strictly as an economic one (Dyson, 2011).
Whether driven by rising economic prosperity or by other demographic shifts also underway, trends in urbanization present great opportunities for development, but at the same time give rise to formidable challenges to social equity, environmental sustainability and governance. Indeed, where people live is a powerful determinant of how they live with respect to employment, consumption patterns, access to basic services such as housing, water, sanitation, education and health care, as well as their environmental footprint and vulnerability to natural hazards.
With sufficient planning, competence and institutional capacity, Governments are able to take advantage of the economies of scale that cities provide to supply infrastructure like roads, piped water and electricity, as well as basic services like education and health care, to a large population at much lower costs than would be required to reach the same number of people dispersed over rural areas. These advantages of city life, combined with the higher incomes available in urban areas compared to rural areas, afford numerous advantages to city dwellers: urban living is often associated with higher levels of literacy and education, womens status and labour force participation, as well as better health, greater access to social services, and enhanced opportunities for cultural and political participation (Cohen, 2006).
Nevertheless, rapid and unplanned urban growth threatens sustainable development when the necessary infrastructure is not developed or when policies are not implemented to ensure that the benefits of city life are equitably shared. An estimated 863 million people, representing nearly one third of urban residents in developing regions, lived in slums or informal settlements in 2012, characterized by housing that is non-durable or overcrowded, or that lacks access to improved water and sanitation or security against eviction (united_nations, 2014b).
Addressing urban inequalities is key to achieving sustainable development. Slum dwellers face greater exposure to environmental hazards, such as pollution, and suffer increased health risks as a result. Evidence from 191 Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in countries of Africa, Asia and latin_america undertaken over the last several years, shows that infants and children residing in slums have substantially greater incidence of diarrhoeal illness than their urban peers and are less likely to survive to their fifth birthdays (Fink, Gunther and Hill, 2014). The urban poor in developed countries also face marked disparities in health and well-being.
Furthermore, much of the increase in the numbers of urban poor is taking place in locations that are highly vulnerable to natural disasters and are expected to experience the greatest impact of climate change, such as low-elevation coastal zones and arid regions known as dry lands (Balk et al., 2009). Seasonal, temporary and permanent migration is already among the strategies that households utilize when faced with food and livelihood insecurity associated with climate variability (united_nations University, 2012), and climate-related migration could become more prevalent in the future with the anticipated increase in frequency and intensity of adverse climate events.
The future growth of cities and concomitant appropriation of land and natural resources will determine success towards an environmentally sustainable future. In some cities, unplanned or inadequately managed urban expansion leads to rapid sprawl, pollution, and environmental degradation, together with unsustainable production and consumption patterns. Todays cities are growing twice as fast in terms of land area as they are in terms of population (Angel et al., 2011). Consequently, projections indicate that future trends in urbanization could produce a near tripling in the global urban land area between 2000 and 2030 (Angel et al., 2011; Seto et al., 2012), as hundreds of thousands of additional square kilometres are developed to urban levels of density. Such urban expansion threatens to destroy habitats in key biodiversity hotspots and contributes to carbon emissions associated with tropical deforestation and land use change.
Environmental sustainability is additionally challenged by the consumption patterns that prevail in urban settings. Owing in part to their higher incomes, urban dwellers tend to consume more per capita than rural dwellers. Todays cities consume more than two-thirds of the worlds energy and account for more than 70 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions (UN-Habitat, 2011; IEA, 2008). Low-density urban areas tend to consume more than high-density areas. Evidence from Toronto indicates that energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions are twice as high on a per capita basis in low-density suburban development compared to development in the high-density urban core (Norman et al., 2006; Hoornweg et al., 2011).
To respond to the challenges and leverage the opportunities presented by continuing urbanization, Governments should implement forward-looking policies that prepare for a growing number of urban dwellers with an eye towards sustainability. Sustainable urbanization requires generating better income and employment opportunities in both urban and rural areas; expanding the necessary infrastructure for water and sanitation, energy, transportation, information and communications; ensuring equal access to services, like education and health care; developing sufficient quality housing and reducing the number of people living in slums; and preserving the natural assets within the city and surrounding areas.
The outcome of the Rio+20 united_nations Conference on Sustainable Development, The Future We Want, recognized both the plight of the urban poor and the need for sustainable cities as matters of great urgency for the united_nations development agenda. Building on that momentum, the third united_nations Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat III) is planned for 2016 to bring together world leaders to review the global urban agenda and forge a new model of urban development that integrates all facets of sustainable development to promote equity, welfare and shared prosperity in an urbanizing world. 
B. DATA AND METHODS
The estimates of the proportion of the population that is urban and the size of urban agglomerations presented in   are based for the most part on national statistics. Population censuses are the most commonly used sources of data, although estimates obtained from population registers or administrative statistics are also incorporated for some countries.
There exists no common global definition of what constitutes an urban settlement. As a result, the urban definition employed by national statistical offices varies widely across countries, and in some cases has even changed over time within a country. The criteria for what constitutes an urban setting may be based variously on one or a combination of characteristics, such as: administrative criteria that classify municipalities as urban; a minimum population threshold; population density; proportion employed in non-agricultural sectors; the presence of infrastructure such as paved roads, electricity, piped water or sewers; and the presence of education or health services. For example, Botswana considers as urban agglomerations of 5,000 inhabitants or more where 75 per cent of the economic activity is nonagricultural, while in France communes with 2,000 inhabitants or more living in houses separated by at most 200 metres are considered urban. Up until the 1991 census, Uganda considered as urban population centres with 1,000 inhabitants or more, but the minimum threshold was revised for the 2002 census to consider as urban only those centres with 2,000 inhabitants or more.
Of the 233 countries or areas for which estimates and projections of the urban and rural populations were produced, 125 use administrative criteria to distinguish between urban and rural areas. Sixty-five of these countries use administrative designations as the sole criterion (table 1). In 121 cases, the criteria used to characterize urban areas include population size or population density, and in 49 cases such demographic characteristics are the sole criterion. However, the lower limit above which a settlement is considered urban varies considerably, ranging between 200 and 50,000 inhabitants. Economic characteristics were part of the criteria used to identify urban areas in 32 countries or areas, including all the successor states of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Criteria related to the functional nature of urban areas, such as the existence of paved streets, water-supply systems, sewerage systems or electric lighting, were part of the definition of urban in 54 cases, but only in ten cases were such criteria used alone. Lastly, in seven cases no definition of urban was available and in eight cases the entire population of a country or area was considered to be urban.
In estimating the proportion urban for World Urbanization Prospects, adjustments are made to the national estimates only when it is clear that the definitions of urban settlements used by a given country have changed over time in ways that lead to inconsistencies in the data. No attempts have been made to impose consistency in definitions across countries. However, several efforts are underway at different institutions to produce globally consistent estimates of the proportion urban with uniform criteria to define urban areas by relying, for example, on satellite imagery of land cover or night-time lights. Nonetheless, to date, these approaches have not generated the long historical time series of urbanization estimates required for this report.
Often, city population statistics are reported in terms of the territory delimited by administrative boundaries that do not necessarily coincide with the extent of the urbanized territory contained in the urban agglomeration or metropolitan region. In generating the time series of the population of cities with 300,000 or more inhabitants in 2014, estimates based on the concept of the urban agglomeration, which refers to the population contained within the contours of the contiguous territory inhabited at urban levels of residential density, is favoured over other concepts. Adjustments are made to the city populations reported in national statistics only when necessary to achieve internal consistency with the city definition and total urban population in the country.
In the 2014 Revision, the city data for 79 of the 232 countries or areas considered were based on the concept of urban agglomeration (table 2, above). In a further 28 countries, data for the capital city were reported in terms of urban agglomeration, whereas data for other cities referred to city proper, urban agglomeration or metropolitan area. For an additional 89 countries or areas the city data available reflected a definition of a city proper. In 48 countries or areas different definitions were used for different cities. Adjustment of city data was carried out when information for a particular city had changed over time. Where possible, the urban agglomeration concept was used. However, when recent data were based on the concept of city proper and there was insufficient information to adjust the data to reflect the population in the urban agglomeration, a time series based on the city proper definition was used.
The heavy reliance on census sources means that there are intercensal gaps between the national estimates of proportion urban and city population in the time series from 1950 to 2014. To fill in those gaps, estimates are interpolated or, for the intervals between the last data point and 2014, extrapolated from the last data point. For years beyond 2014, the proportion urban is projected to 2050 in single year intervals while the city populations are projected to 2030 in 5 year intervals.
The method to project the proportion urban was first used in the 1970s (united_nations, 1974 and 1980) and, although it has undergone some revisions since then, the general approach has not changed. Basically, the method projects the most recent urban-rural growth difference observed by assuming that it converges over a period of 25 years towards a global norm that relates the urban-rural growth difference to the proportion urban. The method used for projecting city populations is similar to that used to project the proportion urban. Specifically, the last observed city growth rate is assumed to converge towards an expected value that is based on the city population and on the growth rate of the overall urban population in the country.
The estimated and projected values of the proportion urban spanning 1950 to 2050 for each country or area are then applied to the total population as estimated or projected in the medium variant in World Population Prospects: The 2012 Revision (united_nations, 2013a) in order to obtain country-level estimates of the urban and rural populations. The 2014 Revision of World Urbanization Prospects updates and supersedes all previous estimates and projections of urban and rural populations and of urban agglomerations published by the united_nations.
C. OUTLINE OF THIS REPORT
This report is presented in five chapters. Chapter II summarizes the levels and trends in urbanization at various levels of aggregation, presenting the estimates and projections of the percentage urban, the rate of urbanization and the size and growth rates of the urban and rural populations for groups of countries classified, variously, by development group (more, less and least developed), level of income, and major area or region. Chapter III also examines the levels and trends in urbanization at the country level so as to assess the degree of heterogeneity in the urban transition both between and within the aggregate groups analysed in Chapter II. Chapter IV describes the population size and growth of the worlds urban agglomerations with at least 300,000 inhabitants in 2014, while also examining trends in the urban hierarchy and city primacy. Chapter V lists the empirical data sources that were referenced in estimating and projecting the urban and rural populations and the populations of urban agglomerations for each country. The report concludes with a set of annex tables that present selected estimates and projections of the 2014 Revision. All of data associated with the 2014 Revision, as well as country profiles, wall charts, maps, and detailed descriptions of the methodology can be accessed at .
I. KEY FINDINGS OF THE 2014 REVISION
This chapter summarises the key findings and figures on the levels and trends of urbanization, the size and growth of the urban and rural populations, and the size and growth of major urban agglomerations from  . More detailed analyses and evidence associated with these findings are presented in subsequent chapters of this report.
A. LEVELS AND TRENDS OF URBANIZATION
Globally, more people live in urban areas than in rural areas. In 2007, for the first time in history, the global urban population exceeded the global rural population, and the worlds population has remained predominantly urban thereafter (figure I.1).
The process of global urbanization has proceeded rapidly over the past six decades. In 1950, more than two-thirds (70 per cent) of people worldwide lived in rural settlements and less than one-third (30 per cent) in urban settlements. In 2014, 54 per cent of the worlds population was urban.
Global urbanization is expected to continue, so that by 2050, the world will be one-third rural (34 per cent) and two-thirds urban (66 per cent), roughly the reverse of the global rural-urban population distribution of the mid-twentieth century.

Rural
The number of countries that are considered to be highly urbanized has increased dramatically in recent decades and is projected to continue to increase in the coming decades. Among 233 countries or areas, just 24 per cent had levels of urbanization greater than 50 per cent in 1950 and only 8 per cent were more than 75 per cent urban. By 2014, 63 per cent of countries were more than half urban and one-third was more than 75 per cent urban. By 2050 more than 80 per cent of countries in the world are projected to be at least half urban and just under 50 per cent will be at least 75 per cent urban (figure I.2).

Population (millions)
Despite the rapid pace of the urban transition observed since 1950 in many countries, a substantial number continue to have very low levels of urbanization. In 2014, 24 countries had less than a quarter of their respective populations residing in urban areas, down from 106 in 1950. Of these, 9 were located in Africa, 7 in Oceania, 4 in latin_america and the Caribbean, 3 in Asia and 1 in Europe. By 2050, just 7 countries are projected to be less than 25 per cent urban, all but one of which are small island states or territories with well under 2 million inhabitants33.
Among those countries or areas with at least 90,000 inhabitants in 2014, the most highly urbanized were Hong Kong, Macao and Singapore (each 100 per cent urban), followed by Qatar (99 per cent urban), and Guadeloupe, Kuwait and Belgium (each 98 per cent urban) (table I.1). Projections to 2050 indicate that each of the 10 most urbanized countries will be more than 97 per cent urban.
The ten least urbanized countries in 2014 were all less than 20 per cent urban (table I.2). By 2050, seven of the ten least urbanized are expected to be at least 25 per cent urban.

Levels of urbanization vary greatly across regions. In 2014, high levels of urbanization, at or above 80 per cent, characterized latin_america and the Caribbean and Northern America. Europe, with 73 per cent of its population living in urban areas, is expected to be over 80 per cent urban by 2050 (figure I.3). Africa and Asia, in contrast, remain mostly rural, with 40 per cent and 48 per cent of their respective populations living in urban areas in 2014.
Figure I.3. Urban and rural population as a proportion of total population, by major area, 1950-2050
Over the coming decades, the level of urbanization is expected to increase in all regions, with Africa and Asia urbanizing faster than the rest. In 2014, the proportion urban in Asia and Africa was increasing at rates of 1.5 per cent and 1.1 per cent per annum, respectively. Nevertheless, these two regions, which are projected to reach 56 per cent and 64 per cent urban by mid-century, respectively, are still expected to be less urbanized than other regions of the world. Regions that already have relatively high levels of urbanization are urbanizing at a slower pace, at less than 0.4 per cent annually (figure I.4).

Year
Temporal patterns in urbanization since 1950 have varied across regions. In Asia, the rate of urbanization has fluctuated widely since 1950, mainly as a result of a stagnation of the urbanization process in China in the late 1960s and early 1970s and its subsequent upturn. Europe, Northern America and Oceania, on the other hand, each experienced a period of stable urbanization, and overall their rates of urbanization have been slower over the past two decades. In latin_america and the Caribbean, the rate of urbanization has declined smoothly over the past six decades. The pace of urbanization has accelerated recently in Africa and while the rate of urbanization is projected to decline gradually in the coming decades, Africa is expected to be the fastest urbanizing region from 2020 to 2050.
While the high income countries have been highly urbanized for several decades, upper-middleincome countries have experienced the fastest pace of urbanization since 1950. In 1950, a majority (57 per cent) of the population in high-income countries already lived in urban areas (figure I.5). Their level of urbanization is expected to rise further, from 80 per cent in 2014 to 86 per cent in 2050. In contrast, in the upper-middle-income countries, only 20 per cent of the population lived in urban areas in 1950, but these countries urbanized rapidly and were 63 per cent urban in 2014. This percentage is expected to rise to 79 per cent urban by 2050. Countries such as Brazil, China, Iran and Mexico are in this group and have experienced both rapid urbanization and rapid growth of gross national income.
In the lower-middle-income countries the pace of urbanization has been slower. Nevertheless, this group of countries is expected to experience faster urbanization than others in the coming decades. In 2014, the proportion of the population living in urban areas was 39 per cent in lower-middle-income countries and 30 per cent in low-income countries. By 2050, these countries are expected to reach, on average, 57 per cent and 48 per cent urban, respectively.

B. THE SIZE AND GROWTH OF THE URBAN AND RURAL POPULATIONS
The worlds urban population is expected to increase by more than two thirds by 2050, with nearly 90 per cent of the increase to take place in the urban areas of Asia and Africa. The global urban population grew rapidly from around 700,000 in 1950 to close to 3.9 billion in 2014 and is expected to reach 6.3 billion in 2050. Asia was home to just over half of the worlds urban population in 2014, despite its lower level of urbanization (figure I.6). Europe had the second highest share of the global urban population, at 14 per cent, followed by latin_america and the Caribbean with 13 per cent. Over the next four decades, Africa and Asia will experience marked increases in their urban populations. By mid-century, the urban population of Africa is likely to triple and that of Asia to increase by 61 per cent so that by 2050 most of the worlds urban population will be concentrated in Asia (52 per cent) and Africa (21 per cent).
Figure I.6. Urban population by major area, 1950-2050
Just a few countries are home to half of the worlds urban population. In 2014, China had the largest urban population, with 758 urban dwellers, accounting for 20 per cent of the global total. China was followed by India, with 410 million urban dwellers and the united_states, with 263 million urban

dwellers. These three countries, together with Brazil, Indonesia, Japan and the russian_federation accounted for just over half of the global urban population. The addition of another 13 countries cumulatively accounted for 70 per cent of the global urban population in 2014 (figure I.7).
Figure I.7. Urban population size in 2014 and increase in urban population projected between 2014 and 2050 
Future growth of the global urban population is expected to be concentrated in just a handful of countries. Taken together, China, India and Nigeria are projected to account for 37 per cent of the increase of nearly 2.5 billion people in the urban population between 2014 and 2050. Just seven other countries are expected to contribute more than 50 million each to the urban increment between 2014 and 2050 and will constitute together another 20 per cent of the total increase in urban population.
In a few countries, the urban population is projected to decline, despite projected increases in the level of urbanization. The largest declines between 2014 and 2050 are projected for Japan, with a decline of 12 million urban dwellers, and for the russian_federation, with a decline of 7 million.
The rural population of the world has grown slowly since 1950 and is expected to reach its peak in a few years. The global rural population increased from less than 2 billion in 1950 to nearly 3.4 billion in 2014. The number of rural dwellers worldwide is projected to decline to 3.2 billion by 2050 (figure I.8).
Figure I.8. Rural population by major area, 1950-2050
The worlds rural population is increasingly concentrated in the less developed countries of Asia and Africa. Just 14 countries accounted for 70 per cent of the total rural population of the world in 2014, including only three developed countries (the united_states, Japan and the russian_federation). While the global rural population is expected to shrink between 2014 and 2050 from 3.4 billion to 3.2 billion people, many countriesall in the less developed regionsare projected to see substantial rural population growth in the coming decades.
Nigeria is projected to see the largest absolute increase in rural population, adding 50 million rural dwellers between 2014 and 2050 (table I.3). Nigeria is followed by Ethiopia, with nearly 39 million new rural dwellers projected by 2050, and Uganda with close to 38 million new rural dwellers projected by 2050. In proportional terms, Niger is expected to experience the greatest rural population growth between 2014 and 2050, nearly tripling its rural population with the addition of 30 million rural dwellers.

The largest rural population declines are expected in China, with a reduction of 300 million rural dwellers, equivalent to close to one half of the rural population in 2014, and in India, where the number of rural residents is expected to decline by 52 million, representing 6 per cent of the rural population in 2014 (table I.4). In proportional terms, Japan is projected to have the largest rural population loss: the rural population in 2050 will be 71 per cent smaller than in 2014 (see chapter III for data).

Urban population growth is nearly universal, but the world is split with respect to rural population change: around two-thirds of countries will experience reductions in the size of their rural populations between 2014 and 2050, while the remainder will see their rural populations hold steady or grow (figure I.9). No country will experience urban decline and rural growth. Urban growth that is concurrent with rural growth is expected in a majority of countries in Africa (79 per cent), and will occur in 62 per cent of countries in Oceania as well. Urban population growth that is accompanied by rural population decline is projected for all of Northern America, 74 per cent of countries in Europe, 71 per cent in latin_america and the Caribbean, and 63 per cent in Asia. Eleven countries in EuropeBulgaria, Belarus, Estonia, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, the Republic of Moldova, the russian_federation, Serbia and Ukraineas well as Japan, Cuba, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, are each projected to experience declines in both the urban and rural populations by 2050.

C. THE SIZE AND GROWTH OF MAJOR URBAN AGGLOMERATIONS
Megacities are notable for their size and concentration of economic activity, but are home to only about one in eight of the worlds urban dwellers. In 1990 there were 10 cities with more than 10 million inhabitants, and these so-called megacities were home to 153 million people, representing less than 7 per cent of the global urban population. By 2014, the number of megacities had nearly tripled to 28, the population they contain grew to 453 million, and these agglomerations accounted for 12 per cent of the worlds urban dwellers (figure I.10).
In 2014, Tokyo was the worlds largest city with an agglomeration of 38 million inhabitants, followed by Delhi with 25 million, Shanghai with 23 million, and Mexico City, Mumbai and Sao Paulo, each with around 21 million inhabitants. By 2020, Tokyos population is projected to begin to decline, although it will remain the worlds largest agglomeration in 2030 with 37 million inhabitants, followed closely by Delhi, whose population is projected to rise swiftly to 36 million (figure I.11). While Osaka (Kinki Major Metropolitan Area or M.M.A.) and New York-Newark were the worlds second and third largest urban agglomerations in 1990, by 2030 they are projected to fall in rank to the 13th and 14th positions, respectively.
Large cities of 5 to 10 million inhabitants account for a small, but growing proportion of the global urban population. In 2014, just over 300 million people lived in the 43 large cities with 5 to 10 million inhabitants, which include such cities as Santiago (Chile), Madrid (Spain), and Singapore. Large cities accounted for 8 per cent of the worlds urban population in 2014. The number of such cities is expected to grow to 63 by 2030 and house more than 400 million people, representing close to 9 per cent of the global urban population.
One in five urban dwellers worldwide in 2014 lived in a medium-sized city of 1 million to 5 million inhabitants. While considered medium-sized by global standards, these cities were, in fact, the largest cities in 79 countries. Examples include Sydney (Australia), Addis Ababa (Ethiopia) and Montevideo (Uruguay). The global population living in medium sized cities nearly doubled between 1990 and 2014, and is expected to increase by another 36 per cent between 2014 and 2030, growing from 827 million to 1.1 billion.
The number of people living in cities of between 300,000 and 1 million inhabitants is expected to grow from 521 million in 2014 to 828 million in 2030, but will continue to hold only around 16 per cent of the global urban population.
In 2014, 43 per cent of the worlds urban population lived in settlements with fewer than 300,000 inhabitants. While this proportion is projected to shrink over time, by 2030 these small cities and towns will still be home to around 38 per cent of urban dwellers.
Most megacities and large cities are located in the global South (figure 1.12). China alone has six megacities and ten cities with populations between 5 and 10 million in 2014, and it will add one more megacity and six more large cities by 2030. Four of Indias cities with 5 to 10 million inhabitants in 2014 are projected to become megacities in the coming years (Ahmadabad, Bangalore, Chennai and Hyderabad), for a total of seven megacities projected in the country by 2030. Outside of China and India, Asia has seven other megacities and eleven other large cities in 2014. Cairo, Kinshasa and Lagos are the only megacities in Africa in 2014, but three more are expected to emerge by 2030, as Dar es Salaam (Tanzania), Johannesburg (South Africa), and Luanda (Angola) are each projected to surpass the 10 million mark. The number of large cities with populations between 5 and 10 million is Africa is also expected to increase, from three in 2014 to twelve in 2030. In latin_america, Bogota (Colombia) and Lima (Peru) are projected to grow beyond the 10 million mark by 2030, joining the four current megacities of the region: Buenos Aires, Mexico City, Rio de Janeiro, and Sao Paulo. Notably, there are varying degrees of uncertainty in the projections of cities, with greater uncertainty for cities like Kinshasa where the speed of fertility decline is still fairly uncertain and census data have not been collected or reported in decades.
The rate at which cities grow can be influenced by a multitude of factors, such as geographic location, climate and topography, the types of industries that characterize the citys economy, availability of natural resources, such as water, and proximity to and linkages with other cities in the region, to name a few (Balk et al., 2009; Kim and Montgomery, 2012). As a result, neither major area nor city population size is an effective predictor of city growth rates. Across all major areas and city class sizes, substantial variation in the rates of city population growth is observed over the recent past from 1990-2014 (figure I.13).
In Africa, median growth rates are similar  between 2 and 3 per cent per year  across all city size classes. The same is observed in Asia, except that Asias megacities tended to grow at slower rates than cities in the other size classes. In Europe, large cities with between 5 and 10 million inhabitants grew more rapidly  at rates around one per cent per yearthan smaller cities, where the median growth rates fell close to zero owing to population decline in many medium sized and smaller cities over this period.
Figure I.13 Average annual rate of population change by size class of urban settlement and major area, 1990-2014
NOTE: For urban agglomerations of each size class at the beginning of each period.
In both latin_america and the Caribbean and Northern America, median population growth rates across smaller cities tended to be modestly faster than for larger cities and no discernible association between city size and growth rate is evident for Oceania, due in part to the small number of cities in the region.
Most of the worlds fastest growing urban agglomerations are medium-sized cities or cities with less than 1 million inhabitants located in Asia or Africa. Between 1990 and 2014, the worlds cities with more than 300,000 inhabitants grew at an average annual rate of 1.9 per cent. However, 99 cities grew more than twice as fast, with average growth rates in excess of 4 per cent per year. Of these fastest growing cities, 74 were located in Asia (51 in China alone), 20 in Africa, 4 in Northern America and one in latin_america and the Caribbean. Only two had populations greater than 5 million in 1990; 23 had between 1 million and 5 million inhabitants; and 74 were smaller than 1 million.
Some cities have experienced population decline since 1990, most of which are located in lowfertility countries of Asia and Europe with stagnating or declining populations. Economic contraction and natural disasters have contributed to population loss in some cities as well. In the united_states, for example, Buffalo and Detroit each experienced net losses of population between 1990 and 2014, concurrent with a loss of industry and jobs in those cities, while New Orleans experienced population decline in the wake of the 2005 Hurricane Katrina.
II. URBAN AND RURAL POPULATION GROWTH AND WORLD URBANIZATION PROSPECTS
This chapter provides an assessment of urban and rural population growth and levels and trends in urbanization globally and for groups of countries classified according to development groups, level of income, and major area. Section A presents an overview of urbanization at the global level. Section B contrasts the levels and trends in urban areas for the more developed and less developed regions; section C does the same for income groups; and section D for major areas.
A. OVERVIEW OF WORLD URBANIZATION TRENDS
Between 1950 and 2014, the urban population of the world grew from an estimated 0.7 billion to an estimated 3.9 billion (table II.1). At the end of this period, the world urban population was more than five times as large as it was at the start. The average annual growth rate of the urban population during this period, at 2.58 per cent, was more than 50 per cent faster than that of the world population as a whole (1.65 per cent). Thus, between 1950 and 2014 the world population was urbanizing rapidly, with the proportion urban rising from 30 per cent in 1950 to 54 per cent in 2014 (see box II.1 for definitions of urbanization). The rate of urbanization between 1950 and 2014, defined as the growth rate of the proportion urban and equal to the difference between the urban growth rate and the total growth rate, was 0.93 per cent per year on average. As a result of this rapid urbanization, the population of the world became in 2007 more urban than rural for the first time. The urbanization process is expected to continue for decades and an ever-increasing majority of humankind will likely be living in urban areas.

BOX II.1. DEFINING URBANIZATION
The word urbanization refers both to a condition at a point in time and to a process occurring over time. The condition of urbanization, referred to as the level of urbanization, is indicated by the percentage of a population that is living in urban areas, however defined (see chapter VI for country-specific definitions of urban population). The process of urbanization has been used in several ways. These include migration from rural areas to urban areas, absolute growth in the urban population (urban growth) and urban growth that is faster than rural growth. In this report, urbanization as a process refers to the last of these: an increase in the level of urbanization, that is, an increase in the percentage urban. The rate of urbanization, then, refers to the growth rate in the level of urbanization.
The growth of the worlds urban population can be put in perspective by comparing dates at which major landmark sizes are reached (table II.2). The urban population first reached 1 billion only in 1959. It reached 2 billion in just another 26 years, passed 3 billion in 2002 and is projected to attain 4 billion in 2016, 5 billion in 2029 and 6 billion in 2045. It is noteworthy that the number of years taken to attain each successive billion after 3 billion changes only slightly. As for the rural population of the world, it reached 2 billion in 1960, 3 billion in 1989, and since it is projected to begin declining after 2020, it may never reach 4 billion. These trends in the growth rates of the urban and rural populations and in the resulting urban-rural population distribution are certain to have important implications for the worlds economy, for the quality of the worlds environment and for the kinds of lives the worlds population will lead.

Although the world population is expected to continue to urbanize, the pace of urbanization is expected to slow in the future, with both the absolute size of the urban population and the proportion urban likely to grow less rapidly. Thus, during 2014-2030 the urban population of the world is projected to increase at an annual rate of 1.7 per cent, much lower than in 1950-1970 (3.0 per cent), 1970-1990 (2.6 per cent) or in 1990-2014 (2.2 per cent) (table II.1, above). For the period 2030-2050, the annual urban growth rate is expected to be even lower: 1.1 per cent. The proportion urban is also expected to rise at a slower pace: 0.7 per cent during 2014-2030 and 0.5 per cent during 2030-2050 (table II.3). By 2050 the population of the world will likely be 66 per cent urban, with urban dwellers numbering 6.3 billion.
In contrast to the rapid rise of the worlds urban population, the growth of the rural population has been slowing markedly. In 1950, seven out of every ten people on earth1.8 billionlived in rural areas. During the subsequent 64 years, rural population growth averaged 1.0 per cent per year, with the result that the rural population nearly doubled, reaching close to 3.4 billion in 2014 (table II.1). The size of the rural population is expected to peak after 2020, still below 3.4 billion, and then to begin a slow decline. It is projected to fall to 3.2 billion by 2050, smaller than it was in 2000.
If the projections are accurate, then all the expected world population growth during 2014-2050 will be in urban areas. That is, during this period the urban population is expected to rise by 2.5 billion persons, from 3.9 billion to 6.3 billion, while the total world population is projected to grow by somewhat less, 2.3 billion, from 7.3 billion in 2014 to 9.6 billion in 2050 (table II.1). The substantial growth expected in the urban population will be fuelled primarily by several factors: natural increase, rural-urban migration and the geographic expansion of urban settlements through the annexation and the transformation of rural villages into small urban settlements (see box II.2).

BOX II.2. SOURCES OF URBAN GROWTH
The growth of cities is the result of the interplay of a limited number of factors: natural increasethat is, the predominance of births over deaths among urban populations migration from rural areas, the annexation of previously rural areas and the reclassification of previously rural areas as urban. Identifying the relative contributions of each of these factors to urban growth can inform policy formulation. For example, a city that is growing primarily as a result of a large influx of rural migrants will require different urban policy and planning compared to a city where growth is driven by high fertility.
To assess the components of urban growth, the Census Survival Ratio Method (CSRM) is commonly applied using repeated rounds of census data that provide information on the distribution by age and sex on total population and urban population. This method estimates two major components of urban growth: 1) natural increase; and 2) net migration together with area reclassification. The united_nations Population Division has published three papers examining components of urban growth. The first publication (united_nations, 1980) presented the CRSM and some basic results using a selection of available censuses from the 1960s and 1970s. The second publication (united_nations, 2001) expanded the analysis by including data from a larger number of developing countries for the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. The third publication (Stecklov, 2008) further expanded the empirical range by including data from 248 censuses taken among 76 countries for the periods between the 1960s and 1990s. 
All three studies pointed to natural increase as the driving force behind urban growth in developing countries: about 60 per cent of the growth of cities in developing countries was due to natural increase, while the remainder was due to net migration and reclassification. However, there are some differences over time and across regions. In both latin_america and the Caribbean and Africa, the contribution of natural increase to urban growth was rising over time, while in Asia it has diminished (figure 1). Specifically, in Asian countries such as Armenia, Indonesia, Nepal and Thailand, the contribution of natural increase to urban growth decreased by half over the past few decades. Whether these declines are due to a relative increase in the role of migration from rural to urban sectors or whether they are capturing more aggressive state policies of urban reclassification cannot be determined using the CSRM approach. Overall, natural increase was the major factor driving city growth in Africa (accounting for 65 per cent of urban growth in the 1990s), Asia (51 per cent in the 1990s) and latin_america and the Caribbean (69 per cent in the 1990s).
Alternative methods that require more detailed analysis at the country level are available to decompose the relative contributions of net migration and urban reclassification factors to urban growth, but cannot currently be applied for most developing countries due to limited data availability. Using censuses and detailed data from National Statistics Office of Thailand, Pejaranonda, Santipaporn and Guest (1995) found that urban growth in Thailand from 1980 to 1990 was driven by four factors: natural increase (46.4 per cent), net migration (25.1 per cent), expansion of existing urban boundaries (14.3 per cent) and urban reclassification (14.2 per cent). Caution must be employed when comparing the level of urbanization over time, especially for countries with frequent changes in urban definitions, to separate political decisions from underlying socio-economic transformations.

B. CONTRASTING URBANIZATION TRENDS IN THE LESS DEVELOPED REGIONS AND THE MORE DEVELOPED REGIONS
Striking differences in patterns of urbanization exist between the more developed regions and the less developed regions. While just over half of the population of the less developed regions currently still lives in rural areas, the great majority in the more developed regions resides in urban areas. However, the urban population of the less developed regions has been growing considerably faster than that of the more developed regions (figure II.1), and as a result, its share of the world urban population has been rising. In 1950 the urban population of the more developed regions was substantially larger than that of the less developed regions (444 million versus 302 million), so that the more developed regions accounted for 60 per cent of the worlds urban population at a time when they had just 32 per cent of the worlds total population (table II.4). But already in the 1950s, the patterns of growth of the urban populations of the more developed and less developed regions were showing signs of divergence, with the former growing more slowly. As a consequence, by 1970 the urban population of the less developed regions had surpassed that of the more developed regions (677 million versus 673 million), and the difference increased rapidly thereafter. In 2014, almost three times as many urban dwellers were estimated to live in the less developed regions as in the more developed regions (2.9 billion versus 1.0 billion) (table II.1). In that year the less developed regions accounted for 75 per cent of the world urban population and 83 per cent of the total world population (table II.4). As the developing world becomes increasingly urbanized, the difference between these two figures will decline. By 2050, with 5.2 billion urban dwellers, the less developed regions are projected to have 82 per cent of the world urban population and 86 per cent of the total world population. Correspondingly, with 1.1 billion urban inhabitants, the urban areas of the more developed regions will account for only 18 per cent of the urban population of the world and 14 per cent of the world population.

Rapid urban growth in the less developed regions has occurred within a context of high population growth. In these regions, sustained high fertility combined with declining mortality resulted in fast population growth that peaked around 1970 (united_nations, 2013a). Fertility has fallen substantially since then, and consequently so has population growth. Urban populations have experienced particularly high growth because of natural increase, rural-urban migration and the expansion of urban localities through the transformation of rural settlements into urban ones.
As a result of the rapid growth of urban areas of the less developed regions, they have accounted for a rising share of the annual increment to the world urban population. The average annual increment of the world urban population rose steadily from 25 million persons in 1950-1955 to 57 million in 1990-1995 and 77 million in 2010-2015. After 2015, it is expected to decline, falling to 62 million in 2045-2050. The annual increment of the urban population in the less developed regions has also been increasing, from 14 million in 1950-1955 to 71 million in 2010-2015. After 2015, a decline is expected to occur so that the average annual increment is expected to be 59 million in 2045-2050 (figure II.2). Meanwhile, the annual increment to the urban population in the more developed regions peaked at 12 million in 1960-1965 and has been falling steadily since. It is expected to continue to fall through at least 2045-2050, when it will be only 3 million per year. These differences between urban growth in the more and less developed regions have resulted in dramatic changes in the distribution of world urban growth. In 1950-1955, the urban areas of the less developed regions absorbed 56 per cent of the annual increment of the world urban population. By 20102015 they were absorbing 92 per cent, and by 2045-2050 they are expected to absorb 96 per cent (figure II.2).
Not only are the urban areas of less developed regions absorbing most of the population growth in the urban areas of the world, they are also increasingly absorbing most of the growth of the entire world population (figure II.3). The annual increment in the world population was growing until 1985-1990, when it reached a peak of 91 million. Since then it has fallen, to 82 million in 2010-2015 and it is expected to continue to fall throughout the projection period. In 1950-1955 the increase in the population of the urban areas of the less developed regions accounted for 30 per cent of the total increment to the worlds population. By 2010-2015 that increase accounted for 87 per cent. After 2030-2035, urban population growth in the less developed regions is expected actually to exceed world population growth since rural populations are projected to decrease.
The contrasting trends in urban growth between the more developed regions and the less developed regions are also apparent when population growth rates are considered. As figure II.4 shows, the growth rate of the urban population of the less developed regions was considerably higher than that of the urban population of the more developed regions throughout the period 1950-2014, and the difference is expected to remain high. Furthermore, whereas the urban growth rate of the more developed regions has been declining fairly steadily since 1950, that of the less developed regions fluctuated during 1950-1985. It began a steady decline in 1980-1985, when it was 4.0 per cent per year. For 2010-2015, the urban growth rate in the less developed regions is estimated at 2.6 per cent per year, more than four times that of the more developed regions (0.6 per cent per year). Notably, between 2014 and 2050, the urban population of the less developed regions is expected to increase by 76 per cent, compared to only 13 per cent in the more developed regions.
The unusual pattern of the urban growth rate of the less developed regions between 1950 and 1985 is primarily related to fluctuations in the worlds largest country, China, which in 1985 accounted for 20 per cent of the urban population of the less developed regions. The annual rate of urban growth in China fluctuated markedly, from 5.2 per cent in 1950-1955 plummeting to 1.9 per cent in 1965-1970, rising back to 4.9 per cent in 1980-1985, and then declining to 3.1 per cent by 2010-2015 (table II.5). When China is excluded from the data, the urban growth rate of the remaining countries of the less developed regions shows no fluctuations: it basically stays at around 4.0 per cent per year between 1950 and 1980 and then declines steadily to reach 2.4 per cent in 2010-2015 (figure II.5).

The irregular trends in Chinas urban population growth rates are quite different from the corresponding trends in the growth rates of the overall population (figure II.6). The decline in urban population growth rates is reflected in the virtual stagnation of the proportion urban (table II.5) during the period of the Cultural Revolution, a programme of radical political and socio-economic reform and civil strife accompanied by the forceful relocation of large numbers of urban dwellers to rural areas. The lack of census information for China for the entire period 1960-1980 limits the possibility of assessing the accuracy of the available official estimates of urban population change during this period. The census of 1982 provided the first comprehensive source of data on the urban population of China since the 1950s. The reduction of the proportion urban in the years before that census reflects both the real effects of the Cultural Revolution and the use of an official definition of urban that might have underestimated the proportion urban. Starting in 1983 the official criteria to determine the geographical demarcation of cities and towns have changed several times (Zhang and Zhao, 1998), leading to increases in the number of localities considered as urban. Reclassification has therefore played an important role in estimates of urbanization trends in China since 1980. This fact should be borne in mind in interpreting trends in urban growth in China, as well as their effects on overall urban growth in the less developed regions and globally.

As with urban population trends, the more and less developed regions also differ markedly in rural population trends. Whereas the rural population of more developed regions has been declining during at least the last 64 years, that of less developed regions has continued to grow (figure II.7). The growth rate of the rural population of the less developed regions peaked at 2.2 per cent per year in 1965-1970 and then began to decline. By 2010-2015, the rural growth rate of the less developed regions stood at just 0.2 per cent per year. It is expected to continue to fall and will become negative by 2030-2035.

The contrasting patterns of growth of the rural populations of the more developed and the less developed regions have resulted in a significant redistribution of the worlds rural population. In 1950, the 369 million rural dwellers in the more developed regions constituted over 21 per cent of the rural population of the world (figure II.8), whereas by 2014, the number of rural dwellers in the more developed regions (276 million) accounted for just over 8 per cent of the worlds rural population. This share is expected to drop to just 6 per cent by 2050, as the rural population in developed countries decreases to 190 million persons. Overall, the rural population of the more developed regions is expected to decline by 31 per cent during the period 2014-2050. In comparison, the rural population of the less developed regions has continued to grow, from 1.4 billion in 1950 to 3.1 billion in 2014, more than doubling over those 64 years. The years to come, however, are expected to witness a major reduction in rural population growth in the less developed regions, and their rural population is expected to decline to 3.0 billion in 2050.
As a consequence of the contrasting growth patterns of the urban and rural populations of the more developed and the less developed regions, the two regions have experienced and are expected to continue to experience different trends in the growth of the proportion urban. As previously noted, the more developed regions were already highly urbanized by 1950, when over half (55 per cent) of their population lived in urban areas (table II.3). At that time, the less developed regions had just 18 per cent of their inhabitants living in cities and towns. However, the urban population of less developed regions has  been growing quite rapidly between 1950 and 2014 and the proportion urban in those regions more than doubled, reaching 48 per cent. In the more developed regions, the proportion urban rose less rapidly but reached 78 per cent by 2014. The projected proportion urban in 2050 is expected to reach 85 per cent in the more developed regions and 63 per cent in the less developed regions. Thus, there is still ample room for a continuing expansion of the proportion urban in the less developed regions. The more developed regions, on the other hand, may be nearing an upper limit.

The contrast is made clearer by considering the rate of urbanization (i.e., the growth rate of the proportion urban). Since 1950, the more developed regions have had a declining rate of urbanization, falling to a low of 0.24 per cent in 1995-2000 (table II.6). Rates rose slightly in 2000-2005 and 2005-2010 and are expected to decline in the future. In contrast, the rate of urbanization of the less developed regions, which was above 1.5 per cent per year from 1950 to 1990 (except for 1965-1975 because of China, as noted above), is expected to fall steadily from 1.2 per cent in 2010-2015 to 0.6 per cent in 20452050, still much higher than the rate for the more developed regions.

C. PATTERNS OF URBAN AND RURAL GROWTH BY INCOME GROUP
Overall, higher income countries have a higher share of population living in urban areas, showing a positive relationship between urbanization and per capita income (box II.3). Today, in high-income countries and upper-middle-income countries, the majority of the population lives in urban areas: 80 per cent and 63 per cent, respectively (figure II.9). The urban transition in higher income countries started many decades ago: 57 per cent of their population lived in urban areas in 1950. This early urbanization was achieved partly due to the Industrial Revolution in Europe and Northern America where rural to urban migration occurred in the 19th century (Bairoch, 1988). Their level of urbanization is expected to rise further from 80 per cent today to 86 per cent in 2050. In contrast, upper-middle-income countries of today started with low levels of urbanization with only 20 per cent of the population living in urban areas in 1950. This percentage rose rapidly to 63 per cent today and is projected to reach 79 per cent by 2050. 
BOX II.3. URBANIZATION AND ECONOMIC GROWTH
Cities are the centres of economic activities that tend to be associated with enhance productivity. Industries and services are usually concentrated within urban areas that attract businesses and skilled people. With financial capital and human capital in one place, productivity is promoted through better division of labour, enhanced intra-industry specialization, easy diffusion of knowledge and mimicry, improved economies of scale and cheaper transport. In addition, cities incubate new ideas and technologies that can accelerate economic progress. City dwellers can gain access to many of the benefits of urban life: higher earnings, better schools and health care, and easy access to infrastructure and services. Under favourable conditions, urbanization can lead to higher gross domestic product (GDP) per capita because of higher levels of productivity (Becker,2008 and Duranton and Puga, 2004).
It is uncertain whether urbanization leads to increases in GDP per capita in all countries and settings. A recent multivariate analysis of cross-country panel data from 1970 to 2000 and found no evidence to support that the level of urbanization affects the rate of economic growth (Bloom et al 2008). Another study by the World Banks World Development Report (2013) indicated that not all countries experienced higher levels of GDP as a larger share of population settled in urban areas. While countries in the Eastern and South-eastern Asia such as China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam experienced a steady increase in GDP per capita as people moved to cities, a similar increase in GDP per capita with urbanization was not observed in sub-Saharan Africa. Cameroon, Liberia, Madagascar and Zimbabwe experienced no growth or a decline in GDP per capita with urbanization, while data from Guinea-Bissau, Ghana, and Nigeria indicated a weak positive link between urbanization and income.
Many factors other than urbanization determine economic growth. Determining whether urbanization causes growth or, conversely, whether economic growth causes urbanization is very difficult to untangle. The evidence shows that there is a positive association between urbanization and per capita income: high-income countries and upper-middle income countries are on average 80 per cent and 60 per cent urbanized respectively, while lowincome countries are only 30 per cent urbanized. Historically, a positive association between GDP growth and urbanization was clear among developed countries over the period 19702010, but the association has been much weaker in latin_america and the Caribbean and nonexistent in sub-Saharan Africa, where urbanization has proceeded in many countries despite slow or even negative economic growth (united_nations, 2013b).

NOTE: The country classification by income level is based on 2012 GNI per capita from the world_bank and it is kept unchanged throughout the estimates and projections.
Lower-income-countries have a lower share of population living in urban areas, but such share is projected to increase substantially in the coming decades. Lower-middle-income countries started with a comparable level of urbanization to upper-middle-income countries in 1950 (around 20 per cent). However, the urbanization process has been slower and the share of population living in urban areas is 39 per cent today. The share is projected to rise further to 57 per cent by 2050. On the other hand, lowincome countries started with a low level of urbanization of 9 per cent in 1950. The level has increased to 30 per cent today and half of the population is projected to live in urban areas by 2050.
Upper-middle-income countries have experienced the fastest pace of urbanization since 1970, but the pace will slow in the coming decades. Between 1970 and 2014, the population of upper-middle-income countries urbanized at an average rate of 1.71 per cent annually, driven by rapid urbanization in several populous countries such as China, Brazil, Iran and Thailand, with average annual urbanization rates between 1.6 to 3.4 per cent over that period (data not shown). However, the urbanization rate in the upper-middle-income group is projected to slow to approximately 0.4 per cent annually, on average, between 2030 and 2050, a comparable rate to that observed in the high-income countries between 1970 and 1990 (table II.7).
Lower-middle and low-income countries are projected to experience the fastest urbanization rates in the coming decades. Over the past few decades, lower-middle and low-income countries experienced urbanization rates between 1.0 and 2.4 per cent annually. Over the coming decades, countries in these income groups will have the highest urbanization rates that fall between 1.0 and 1.4 per cent, overtaking all other income groups. While urbanization rates are projected to slow down in the near future in most countries in the world, several low-income countries in Sub-Saharan Africa will have increasing rates instead. Examples of such countries are Chad, Malawi, Mozambique, Niger, Comoros, South Sudan and Sierra Leone.

D. PATTERNS OF URBAN AND RURAL GROWTH IN THE MAJOR AREAS OF THE WORLD
The different patterns of urbanization observed for more developed regions and less developed regions are the result of widely varying experiences among the major areas that constitute those regions. Europe and Northern America currently exhibit high levels of urbanization but slowing rates of urban population growth (figure II.10). In the developing world, Africa and Asia are still largely rural, whereas latin_america and the Caribbean, having urbanized rapidly since 1950, already has a proportion urban similar to that of the developed countries. Oceania is also highly urbanized largely as a result of high levels of urbanization in Australia and New Zealand.
Despite its low level of urbanization, Asia, because of its large population, has the largest number of persons living in urban areas (2.1 billion in 2014), followed by Europe, with 545 million urban dwellers, latin_america and the Caribbean with 496 million, and Africa with 455 million (table II.8). Because of the relatively high urban population growth rates expected in the future in Africa and Asia, by 2050 those two major areas will have the largest numbers of urban dwellers in the world3.3 billion in Asia and 1.3 billion in Africaeven though they will still be the least urbanized major areas of the world.
Figure II.10 present data, for all major areas of the world, on the average annual rates of change of the urban population since 1950 and those expected in the future. Africas urban population growth rates have been the highest, above 4 per cent per year during 1950-1990, and are expected to remain at or above 3 per cent per annum through 2030-2035. By 2045-2050, the growth rate of Africas urban population is expected to have declined to 2.6 per cent. The urban growth rate of latin_america and the Caribbean was close to that of Africa in 1950-1955 (4.5 per cent versus 4.9 per cent), but declined rapidly to 1.4 per cent in 2010-2015. It is expected to continue to fall further to only 0.4 per cent by 2045-2050.
In Asia, the urban growth rate reflects the fluctuations associated with the urbanization trends experienced by China, as discussed above. It remained over 3 percent until 1990-1995, fell to 2.5 per cent in 2010-2015 and is projected to decline to 0.7 per cent by 2045-2050. In Europe, Northern America and Oceania, urban population growth rates declined markedly between approximately 1960 and 1980, during the so-called counter-urbanization period, and subsequently followed two different paths. In Europe, the urban growth rate continued to fall, to 0.1 per cent during 1995-2000. It rose slightly by 2005-2010, to 0.5 per cent, and is subsequently expected to decline slowly and by 2045-2050, urban populations in Europe, uniquely among major areas, are expected not to increase further (urban growth rate will be below 0.1 per cent). In contrast to Europe, the growth rates of the urban population of Northern America rose as high as 1.6 per cent in 1995-2000, then began a decline that continued through 2010-2015 (1.0 per cent) and that is projected to continue through 2045-2050.

The rapid urban growth experienced by the major areas has resulted in large increases in the numbers of urban dwellers. Africas urban population increased more than fourteen-fold between 1950 and 2014, rising from 35 million to 455 million (table II.8). The urban population of Asia increased by eight-fold, from 245 million to 2.1 billion, while that of latin_america and the Caribbean increased by seven-fold, from 69 million to 496 million. The number of urban dwellers in Northern America more than doubled (from 110 million to 292 million), while that in Oceania tripled (from 8 million to 27 million). Even the urban population of Europe, whose growth rates have been relatively low, experienced a 90 per cent increase during that same period, from 283 million to 545 million.
Given the large differences in urban growth rates across major areas between 1950 and 2014, a significant redistribution of the worlds urban population occurred (table II.8). Africas share almost tripled, from 4 per cent in 1950 to 12 per cent in 2014; Asias share grew by more than 60 per cent, from 33 per cent to 53 per cent; and the share of latin_america and the Caribbean rose from 9 per cent to 13 per cent. Meanwhile, the shares of Europe and Northern America fell, with Europes falling by over half, from 38 per cent to 14 per cent, and Northern Americas from 15 per cent to 8 per cent. Oceanias small share grew even smaller.
Over the next 36 years, the differences expected in urban population growth will accentuate the redistribution of the urban population that occurred during 1950-2014. Africas urban population is likely to triple between 2014 and 2050, while that of Asias is likely to increase by over 60 per cent. With 1.3 billion urban dwellers in 2050, Africa will have 21 per cent of the world urban population, while Asia, with 3.3 billion persons, will have 52 per cent. Together, they will account for nearly three-quarters of the urban population of the world. All other major areas are expected to see their shares of the world urban population decline, even though their urban populations are projected to increase substantially. The urban population of latin_america and the Caribbean will increase by more than a third, from 496 million in 
Asia

2014 to 674 million in 2050, but its share will decline from 13 to 11 per cent. The share of Northern America is expected to decline from 8 per cent to 6 per cent, although its urban population will likely increase by a third. The largest expected reduction is in Europes share, which will decrease from 14 per cent to 9 per cent between 2014 and 2050.

Given their high urban growth rates and their growing shares of the world urban population, Africa and Asia account for most of the increments of the urban population. During 1950-1970, these two major areas together accounted for 51 per cent of all the increase in the world urban population, a share that rose to 81 per cent in 1990-2014, with 64 per cent in Asia alone (table II.9). The share of Africa is expected to continue to increase, to 27 per cent during 2014-2030 and to 44 per cent during 2030-2050. Asias share will fall to over 58 percent, then fall to 43 per cent. Africa and Asia will together account for 87 per cent of all new urban inhabitants between 2014 and 2050. All other major areas will see a decline in their shares of the annual increment to the urban population. The share of latin_america and the Caribbean will likely fall by more than half, from 16 per cent of the world urban increment in 1950-1970 and 19701990 to 6 per cent during 2030-2050. For Oceania and Northern America, the magnitudes of the reductions are smaller, while the proportion of the increment of the urban population accounted for by Europe is reduced to one per cent by 2030-2050, compared to almost 22 per cent in 1950-1970.

Levels of urbanization have been rising among all the major areas since 1950 and are expected to continue to increase through 2050 (figure II.11). Among the major areas of the world, Asia was the second least urbanized in 1950, with 18 per cent of its population living in urban settlements (table II.10). By 2014, after Asia experienced average annual rates of urbanization (rate of change of the percentage urban) of 1.5 per cent per year in 1950-1990 and 1.6 per cent in 1990-2014, the level of urbanization had more than doubled, to 48 per cent. Despite a rate of urbanization of just over 1.1 per cent per year that Asia is expected to experience during 2014-2030 (the highest of any major area, although falling slightly below that of Africa during the 2030-2050 period), only 64 per cent of its population is projected to be urban in 2050, when Asia will still be the second least urbanized major area.

The path of urbanization in Africa has been quite similar to that in Asia. In 1950, Africa had the lowest proportion urban of any major area (14 per cent), but it experienced the fastest rate of urbanization by far during 1950-1970 (2.4 per cent per year) and the second fastest after Asia during 1990-2014 (1.0 per cent per year). By 2014 its urban share had risen to 40 per cent. Africas average rate of urbanization over the coming years is expected to fall, thus will result in a level of urbanization of 56 per cent by 2050. That is, by 2050 the levels of urbanization of both Africa and Asia will have long since passed the 50 per cent mark (Asia in 2018 and Africa in 2038), making their populations more urban than rural.
In contrast to Africa and Asia, the level of urbanization of latin_america and the Caribbean was already relatively high by 1950, when 41 per cent of its population lived in urban areas. Although this level of urbanization was lower than that of the predominantly urban more developed areas of Europe (52 per cent urban), Northern America (64 per cent) and Oceania (62 per cent), over the next 64 years latin_america and the Caribbean experienced a rapid increase in the proportion urban, much faster than in those three areas, averaging 1.6 per cent per year in 1950-1970 and 1.0 per cent per year in 1970-1990. Consequently, its proportion urban had become essentially the same as that of Europe and Oceania by 1990, and in 2014 it surpassed that of both (80 per cent versus 73 per cent and 71 per cent, respectively). With about three-quarters of their populations already living in urban areas, latin_america and the Caribbean and Europe are both expected to experience declines in their annual rates of urbanization, with the result that their proportions urban will increase slowly, reaching 82 per cent in Europe and 86 per cent in latin_america and the Caribbean by 2050.
Oceania, the major area with by far the smallest population (barely one-tenth the population of Northern America in 2014), was the second most urbanized major area in the world in 1950 (62 per cent living in urban settlements), following Northern America (64 per cent). Since then, these two major areas have experienced the lowest rates of urbanization in the world: in 1950-1970, both experienced rates of urbanization around 0.7 per cent per year, but in the subsequent 44 years the rate more than halved in Northern America and became marginally negative for most of the period in Oceania. Nevertheless, Northern America, with 81 per cent of its population living in urban areas, remains the most urbanized major area in the world in 2007; Oceania, with 71 per cent urban, ranks fourth after latin_america and the Caribbean and Europe. Percentages urban are expected to rise to 87 per cent in Northern America and 74 per cent in Oceania by 2050.
A different perspective on trends in urbanization in the major areas of the world can be obtained by considering the rates of urbanization over successive five-year periods (figure II.12). There has been

Northern America considerable variation across major areas in the rates of urbanization. Only latin_america and the Caribbean displays a smoothly declining trend, dropping steadily from 1.8 per cent per year in 1950-1955 to 0.3 per cent in 2010-2015 and expected to fall further below 0.2 per cent in 2045-2050. In Africa, where rates of urbanization were the highest in the world from 1950-1955 to 1970-1975, the rate declined markedly to 0.8 per cent per year in 1995-2000 and was 1.1 per cent in 2010-2015. The rate is expected to stabilize near just below this level until the end of the projection period.
In contrast to Africa and latin_america and the Caribbean, the rate of urbanization in Asia shows no clear trend before 1990, fluctuating sharply, mainly as a result of changes in China, as noted in section A above. Since China is currently home to about one-third per cent of the urban population of Asia, changes in China distort the pattern for Asia as a whole, as is evident from comparing the rates of urbanization in China with those of Asia excluding China (figure II.13). Rates of urbanization in Asia without China show a much smoother pattern but still rise and fall several times, peaking in 1970-1975 at 1.5 per cent per year and again 2000-2005 at 1.1 per cent.
The rates of urbanization of Europe, Northern America and Oceania have been considerably lower than those of the other three major areas (figure II.12). In Oceania, that decline led to negative rates of urbanization in 1975-2000. In Northern America the urbanization rate dropped to nearly zero in the 1970s and recovered to between 0.2 per cent and 0.5 per cent per year in the 1980s and 1990s. Europe experienced higher urbanization rates than Northern America and Oceania from 1950-1955 to 1985-1990, but by 1995-2000 its rate of urbanization was just 0.1 per cent per year, lower than that of Northern America. Over the projection period to 2050, both Europe and Northern America are expected to continue to urbanize at rates ranging from 0.2 per cent to 0.3 per cent per year. Such projected values imply continued increases in the level of urbanization of both regions. The future urbanization rates of Oceania are expected to be lower than those of Europe and Northern America.

The reduction of the rates of urbanization of Europe, Northern America and Oceania since the 1970s has sometimes been referred to as counter-urbanization (although, if urbanization is defined as an increase in the percentage urban, then strictly speaking, counter-urbanization implies a decrease in the percentage urban, and among major regions that has only occurred, as noted above, in Oceania between 1975 and 2000). Such a slowdown in the rate of urbanization can be due to a decrease in the urban growth rate, an increase in the rural growth rate or both. In highly urbanized countries the slowdown was associated with faster growth of non-metropolitan populations compared to those in metropolitan areas (Champion, 1989). In some countries an increase in the rural population growth rate has also been observed. As figure II.14 shows, in both Northern America and Oceania the trends downward in the rates of change of the rural population were temporarily reversed after 1970 and in Europe after 1980. Since such trends in rural population influence levels and rates of urbanization, it is worthwhile to further explore growth rates and population size in rural areas.
In other major areas, two types of trends in population growth rates for rural areas are apparent (figure II.14). First, latin_america and the Caribbean has seen its rural growth rate decline fairly steadily, so that it became essentially zero in 1985-1990 and negative thereafter. Africa and Asia, in contrast, show early peaks and then sustained declines. Both experienced early increases in the rates of growth of their rural populations, during 1950-1985 and 1955-1970, respectively. In the case of Africa, declining mortality combined with sustained high fertility produced the increase in the rural population growth rate, which reached a peak of 2.2 per cent per year in 1975-1985 and is estimated to have declined to 1.8 per cent per year by 2010-2015. In Asia, the highest growth rate of the rural population was in 1965-1970, at 2.3 per cent per year, largely as a result of the high rural growth rate in China. Since then, the growth rate of the rural population of Asia has been declining, and since 2000-2005 has been negative.

For all major areas, rural population growth rates are projected to fall through 2045-2050 (figure II.14). By the end of the projection period, the major areas will still vary considerably in the rates of growth of their rural populations. Thus, by 2045-2050, Europes rural population is expected to be declining at a rate of 1.5 per cent per year; those of Asia, latin_america and the Caribbean and Northern America at a rate between 0.7 and 0.9 per cent per year. Rural populations of Africa and Oceania are projected to continue to grow even in 2045-2050 by 0.8 per cent and 0.3 per cent, respectively.
With regard to rural population size, the rural population of Africa, which increased more than threefold between 1950 and 2014, from 197 million to 683 million, is expected to reach 1.1 billion by 2050 (see table II.8). In Oceania, the rural population more than doubled from 5 million in 1950 to 11 million in 2014 and is expected to reach 15 million by 2050. In Asia, the major area with by far the largest number of rural inhabitants, the rural population is estimated to have grown from 1.2 billion in 1950 to 2.3 billion in 2014. It is projected to decline to below 1.9 billion by 2050, the same level it first reached around 1977. In latin_america and the Caribbean, the rural population rose from 99 million in 1950 to a peak of 130 million around 1990 and then began to decline; it will drop to 108 million in 2050. In Northern America, the rural population amounted to only 62 million in 1950 and 66 million in 2014; it will likely decline towards 56 million in 2050. But Europe has seen the largest decline in rural population, from 266 million in 1950 to 197 million in 2014, and it is likely to drop further to 128 million in 2050. Given the downward trend in rural growth rates around the world, it is useful to identify when the size of the rural population has peaked or is expected to peak in each major area. In Europe, the peak was reached before 1950, in latin_america and the Caribbean the peak was reached in 1993, about 3 years after Northern America, and in Asia the peak was attained around 2001. The peaks in Africa and Oceania are expected not to occur before 2050. 
Asia
latin_america and the Caribbean Oceania
Changes in the size of the rural population of the major areas will result in a significant redistribution of the rural population of the world by major area. Three major areas will show substantial declines in their share of the worlds rural population (table II.8). Europes share of the rural population has already dropped from 15 per cent in 1950 to 6 per cent in 2014 and is expected to fall to 4 per cent by 2050. Meanwhile, the shares of the worlds rural population accounted for by Africa and Asia will both increase markedly. Africas share, only 11 per cent in 1950 and already at 20 per cent in 2014, will increase further to 33 per cent by 2050. Although its share will fall, Asia will remain the home for the great majority of the worlds rural population throughout the projection period. In 2014, 68 per cent of the worlds rural population lived in Asia, and by 2050, it is expected that 58 per cent of the worlds urban population will be living in Asia, lower than the figure for 1950 (65 per cent).
The rapid growth of the urban populations of Africa, Asia, and latin_america and the Caribbean, combined with the continuing declines in rural population growth in most countries (discussed further in chapter III), has important implications for the geographical distribution of population growth. Between 1950 and 2014, the average annual increment of the urban population of Asia (28 million) accounted for more than one-third (35 per cent) of the average annual increment of the world population growth, which is estimated at 74 million. During 2014-2050, when the world population is expected to increase somewhat more slowlyby 64 million persons annuallythe urban areas of Asia will grow by 35 million annually, accounting for 54 per cent of the growth of the world population. Furthermore, the share of the average annual increment to the world population accounted for by the growth of the urban population of Africa will more than quadruple, from 9 per cent in 1950-2014 to 38 per cent of that expected during 2014-2050. For latin_america and the Caribbean, the share of world population growth during 2014-2050 (just over 9 per cent) will be similar to that regions share for 1950-2014 (8 per cent). Consequently, between 2014 and 2050, growth of the urban areas of these three regionsAfrica, Asia, and latin_america and the Caribbeanis anticipated to be equal to the world population growth.
III. URBAN AND RURAL POPULATION SIZE AND GROWTH AT THE COUNTRY LEVEL
The previous chapter highlighted the similarities and differences across geographic regions and income groups with respect to the levels and trends of urbanization over the past 60 years, as well as projections to 2050. While that broad aggregate analysis provides a useful summary of the past and future patterns of urbanization, it tends to disguise the considerable variation in the urban transition experience that exists across countries within regions and income groups. To describe that variability, this chapter undertakes an analysis of country-level trends estimated from 1950 to 2014 and projected to 2050. Section A addresses the level of urbanization; section B describes the size and growth of the urban and rural populations; and section C summarises the rate of urbanization (the average annual rate of change of the percentage urban). Results highlight the substantial degree of heterogeneity in the past and future trends of urbanization both across and within regions and income groups.
A. THE LEVEL OF URBANIZATION
Two types of illustrations reflect the heterogeneity of experience in the global urban transition from 1950 to the present, and the projected future course of the urban transition to 2050. The first illustration, a bubble chart in figure III.1, plots the percentage of the population living in urban settlements at three points in timeestimates for 1950 and 2014 and projections to 2050for 233 countries or areas. Colours differentiate the various major areas, bubble size corresponds to the total population as indicated in the legend, and black bars mark the regional medians at each point in time. Note that the median reflects the median level of urbanization across the countries that comprise each major area, not to be confused with the populationweighted average levels of urbanization presented in the previous chapter. The second illustration, in figure III.2, maps the percentage urban estimated for 1950 and 2014 and projected 2050 for the 233 countries or areas. Higher levels of urbanization are denoted by darker shading in the colour gradient.
The wide dispersion of countries with respect to the percentage urban shown in figure III.1 indicates that countries have experienced very different levels of urbanization both across and within the major areas such that the geographic location of a country is a poor predictor of the percentage urban at any point in time. In fact, in 2014 the most urbanized countries in Africa  the least urbanized region in the world  were more than twice as urban as the least urbanized countries in Europe  a very highly urbanized region. While the degree of within-region dispersion decreased in latin_america and the Caribbean and Europe and Northern America, as a group, between 1950 and 2014, countries in Africa and Asia became even more heterogeneous during that period. Projections to 2050 indicate that the urbanization process will continue in all countries, and while the degree of dispersion will shrink as the percentage urban grows in each region, substantial heterogeneity will persist in Africa, Asia and Oceania, in particular.
Africa
The median level of urbanization across the 58 countries in Africa in 1950 was 10 per cent, but levels of urbanization ranged from below 3 per cent in Swaziland, Rwanda and Botswana, to 51 per cent in Saint Helena (home to around 5,000 people in 1950). Just 9 populations of Africa had levels of urbanization greater than 25 per cent in 1950, but three of the regions largest countries were included among these: South Africa, where 42 per cent of the 14 million residents lived in urban settlements; Egypt, where 32 per cent of the nearly 22 million residents were urban; and Morocco where 26 per cent of the population of 9 million were concentrated in urban areas. Nigeria was Africas most populous country in 1950, with close to 38 million people, 8 per cent of whom resided in urban settlements. 
Over the past 60 years rapid urbanization has taken place in many populations of Africa. Whereas in 1950 only one population was more than 50 per cent urban, in 2014 19 countries in the region housed more than half their population in urban settlements, with Reunion (95 per cent urban) and Gabon (87 per cent urban) observed to have the highest levels of urbanization in the region.
Urbanization has not reached such high levels in many other countries in Africa, however. In 2014, twothirds of the populations in the region had urbanization levels below 50 per cent, and in 9 countries less than one-quarter of the population resided in urban settlements. The least urbanized countries in Africa in 2014 were Burundi (12 per cent urban), and Uganda and Malawi (both 16 per cent urban).
In most of Africa, the urbanization process over the last several decades occurred in tandem with rapid population growth. For example, the United Republic of Tanzania grew from 7.6 million people in 1950 to 50.8 million in 2014 at the same time the proportion of the population residing in urban settlements increased from 3 per cent to 31 per cent. Similarly, the population of Ghana grew from 5.0 million in 1950 to 26.4 million in 2014 while the proportion urban has increased from 15 per cent to 53 per cent.
Each of Africas 58 countries is projected to further urbanize by 2050, when 41 (71 per cent) will be more than 50 per cent urban, of which 11 will be more than 75 per cent urban. However, substantial heterogeneity in the level of urbanization is projected to persist in the region. Although no African country is projected to be less than 25 per cent urban by 2050, 9 countries will be less than 40 per cent urban, including some of the regions most populous countries. Ethiopia is projected to grow from 97 million inhabitants in 2014 to 188 million in 2050 while the proportion urban is projected to increase from 19 per cent to 38 per cent, and in Uganda, 32 per cent of the projected 104 million inhabitants in 2050 are expected to live in urban settlements.
Oceania
The distribution in the levels of urbanization in 1950 across Oceanias populations is much wider than in Africa, reflecting substantial diversity among the 23 countries comprised by the region. Nauru, for instance, has been considered to be 100 per cent urban since before 1950, while the islands of Wallis and Futuna have been considered 100 per cent rural. Australia and New Zealand, the largest populations in Oceania in 1950 with 8.2 million and 1.9 million people, respectively, were more than 70 per cent urban, while in the third largest country, Papua New Guinea, less than 2 per cent of its 1.7 million inhabitants were residing in urban settlements.
The median level of urbanization in Oceania more than doubled from 23 per cent in 1950 to 56 per cent in 2014, but the range of levels across countries in the region remains wide. The population of Australia has nearly tripled to almost 24 million in 2014 and has become 89 per cent urban. At the other end of the distribution, the population of Papua New Guinea has grown in size to surpass New Zealand as the second most populous country in the region at the same time it has urbanized, such that 12 per cent of the 7.5 million inhabitants in 2014 resided in urban settlements.
The bimodal distribution of Oceanias populations is projected to persist to 2050, at which point the median level of urbanization for the region will have risen to 65 per cent. Australia and New Zealand are projected to become 93 per cent and 90 per cent urban, respectively, while the level of urbanization in Papua New Guinea, still low from a global perspective at 23 per cent in 2050, will have nearly doubled from its 2014 level.
Asia
While the median level of urbanization across the 51 countries of Asia in 1950 was only 27 per cent, nine countries in the region had already reached high levels of urbanization above 50 per cent, including Japan where 53 per cent of the population of 82 million resided in urban settlements. The levels of urbanization in Asia in 1950 ranged from a low of 2.1 per cent in Bhutan to a high of 99 per cent in Singapore. In both China and India, the worlds largest populations in 1950 with 544 million and 376 million inhabitants, respectively, the proportion of residents concentrated in urban settlements was below 20 per cent.
Between 1950 and 2014, the median level of urbanization in Asia increased from 27 per cent to 57 per cent. In 2014, 17 countries in Asia were more than 75 per cent urban, including several of the regions most populous countries, such as Japan (93 per cent urban), the Republic of Korea (82 per cent urban), and Saudi Arabia (83 per cent urban). Chinas population has grown to 1.4 billion people in 2014, 54 per cent of whom resided in urban settlements. Indonesia has surpassed the 50 per cent mark as well; 53 per cent of its 253 million inhabitants resided in urban settlements in 2014. Whereas in 1950, 24 countries in Asia had levels of urbanization below 25 per cent, in 2014 just three countries did, including Nepal and Sri Lanka (both 18 per cent urban) and Cambodia (21 per cent urban). The population of India more than tripled since 1950 to nearly 1.3 billion and the level of urbanization nearly doubled, reaching 32 per cent in 2014.
Projections indicate that by 2050, half of Asias countries will have levels of urbanization greater than 72 per cent and 45 of the 51 countries (88 per cent) will be more than 50 per cent urban. After Hong Kong, Macao and Singapore, which are projected to remain 100 per cent urban through 2050, the most urbanized populations in Asia will be Qatar, Kuwait and Japan. Cambodia, Nepal and Sri Lanka are projected to remain Asias least urbanized countries in 2050, although they all are expected to urbanize to levels above 30 per cent.
latin_america and the Caribbean
In general, the more populous countries of latin_america and the Caribbean tended to be more urbanized than the less populous ones in 1950. Of the 24 countries with levels of urbanization below the median 36 per cent for the region, 18 had fewer than 2 million residents and 8 were islands with populations of less than 100,000 inhabitants. The regions largest country in 1950, Brazil with close to 54 million inhabitants, was 36 per cent urban, while in Mexico, the second most populous country with 28 million inhabitants, 43 per cent lived in urban settlements. In 1950, the lowest levels of urbanization across the 48 countries of latin_america and the Caribbean were in the British Virgin Islands (11 per cent urban) and Haiti (12 per cent urban), while the highest levels were in Anguilla, Sint Maarten and the Cayman Islands (each 100 per cent urban), followed by Uruguay (78 per cent urban).
In 2014, all of the countries of latin_america and the Caribbean with more than 2 million inhabitants were more than 50 per cent urban and the median for the region overall had risen to 72 per cent. Anguilla, Sint Maarten and the Cayman Islands remained 100 per cent urban in 2014, and were followed in terms of the level of urbanization by Guadeloupe (98 per cent urban), the US Virgin Islands (95 per cent urban), Uruguay (95 per cent urban), Puerto Rico (94 per cent urban), Turks and Caicos Islands (92 per cent urban) and Argentina (92 per cent urban). Brazils total population remained the largest in the region and an estimated 85 per cent of the 202 million people in 2014 resided in urban settlements. Mexicos population grew to 124 million in 2014 and 79 per cent lived in urban settlements.
The least urbanized countries in the latin_america and Caribbean region in 2014 were Trinidad and Tobago, where the country-specific urban definition includes only the capital city Port-of-Spain, the borough of Arima and the town of San Fernando, but not the surrounding suburbs or other towns, and Montserrat,  where volcanic activity that resumed in the mid-1990s forced the population to abandon the capital city of Plymouth.
In 2050, the median level of urbanization in latin_america and the Caribbean is projected to reach close to 80 per cent, and all of the populations of at least 2 million will be at least 65 per cent urban. Fifteen countries in the region will be more than 90 per cent urban, including, in order of the level of urbanization in 2050: Anguilla, Sint Maarten, the Cayman Islands, Guadeloupe, Uruguay, the US Virgin Islands, Turks and Caicos Islands, Puerto Rico, Argentina, Chile, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), Martinique, Brazil, Curacao and the Dominican Republic.
Europe and Northern America
Among the 53 countries of Europe and Northern America, the lowest levels of urbanization in 1950 were observed in Montenegro (13 per cent) and Bosnia and Herzegovina (14 per cent), while the highest were in Bermuda, Monaco, the Holy See and Gibraltar (each 100 per cent) followed by Belgium (91 per cent). Only 8 countries in the regional group had levels of urbanization above 75 per cent, and only one of these  the united_kingdom, which was 79 per cent urban in 1950  had a population greater than 10 million. The united_states of America, with 158 million people in 1950, was 64 per cent urban, while the former-Soviet Republic that is todays russian_federation was home to 103 million people, 44 per cent of whom resided in urban settlements. As in latin_america and the Caribbean, the less urbanized countries in Europe and Northern America tended to be those with smaller populations. Of the ten countries in the region with levels of urbanization below 25 per cent in 1950, six had populations smaller than 2 million and the remaining four had between 2 million and 7 million inhabitants. Eight of the ten least urbanized countries in Europe in 1950 are located on the Balkan Peninsula34.
In 2014, the median level of urbanization across countries of Europe and Northern America was higher than in all other regions, at 74 per cent, and 40 of the 53 countries (75 per cent) countries were more than 60 per cent urban. Among the countries in the region with at least 90,000 inhabitants in 2014, Belgium remained the most urbanized, with 98 per cent of its population concentrated in urban settlements, followed by Malta, which was 95 per cent urban in 2014, Iceland (94 per cent urban) and the Netherlands (90 per cent urban). Thirteen countries in Europe and Northern America were less than 60 per cent urban in 2014. Romania was the most populous among these, where 54 per cent of the nearly 22 million inhabitants resided in urban settlements. The most populous country in the group, the united_states with 323 million inhabitants, was 81 per cent urban in 2014, while the second most populous, the russian_federation with 142 million inhabitants, was 74 per cent urban.
By 2050, all but five countries in Europe are projected to be at least 60 per cent urban, and three of the remaining five (Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Faroe Islands, and the Republic of Moldova) are expected to be more than 50 per cent urban. Liechtenstein and the Channel Islands are projected to be the least urbanized among the 53 countries, with projected levels of urbanization of 20 per cent and 41 per cent, respectively. The median level of urbanization among the 53 countries of Europe and Northern America is projected to rise to 82 per cent and 14 countries will be more than 90 per cent urban, including and Sweden (90 per cent urban) and Denmark (92 per cent urban), among others35.
The worlds most urbanized countries
The number of highly urbanized countries has increased over time and the list has grown to include populations from each of the major regions. Table III.1 lists the countries or areas with 90 per cent of the population residing in urban areas in 1950, 1990, 2014 and 2050, of those with a population of at least 90,000 in 2014. Of the 201 populations considered, only three counted more than 90 per cent of their populations living in urban settlements in 1950, including Singapore, Macao and Belgium (table III.1)36.
In 2014, there were 17 countries with at least 90,000 inhabitants that had more than 90 per cent of their populations residing in urban settlements. This group of highly urbanized countries was comprised primarily of smaller populations, such as Qatar with 99.2 per cent of its 2.3 million residents concentrated in urban settlements, and Israel, where 92.1 per cent of the population of 7.8 million lived in urban areas. Nevertheless, a couple of large countries had moved into this category as well: 93.0 per cent of Japans population of 127 million and 91.6 per cent of Argentinas population of 42 million was concentrated in urban areas in 2014.
By 2050, projections indicate that 32 countries with at least 90,000 inhabitants in 2014 will have become more than 90 per cent urban and the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Chile, Australia, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), Denmark, Bahrain, Lebanon, Martinique, Gabon, Brazil, the United Arab Emirates, Curacao, Sweden and the Dominican Republic will all join the list.
The worlds least urbanized countries
Among countries that are considered the least urbanized in the world, the proportion urban has increased substantially. Table III.2 lists in rank order the ten least urbanized countries, of those with at least 90,000 inhabitants in 2014, in each of the years 1950, 1990, 2014, and 2050. Of these, Papua New Guinea and Burundi were the least urbanized in 1950 with 1.7 per cent of their populations residing in urban areas. Seven of the ten least urbanized countries in 1950 were located in Africa.
In 2014, only one of the ten least urbanized countries had a level of urbanization below 10 per cent: Trinidad and Tobago, where 8.6 per cent of the population resided in urban settlements. Burundi had the second least urbanized population at 11.8 per cent urban, followed by Papua New Guinea (13.0 per cent urban) and Uganda (15.8 per cent urban). In 2014, five of the ten least urbanized countries were in subSaharan Africa (Burundi, Uganda, Malawi, Niger and South Sudan). Another two were in South Asia (Nepal and Sri Lanka), two in the Caribbean (Trinidad and Tobago and Saint Lucia) and one in Oceania (Papua New Guinea). 
Although urbanization levels were low relative to other countries, those listed in table III.2 were nevertheless urbanizing in recent decades and are expected to continue to do so into the future. In Burundi, for instance, the level of urbanization rose from 1.7 per cent in 1950 to 11.8 per cent in 2014 and the country is projected to become 26.3 per cent urban by 2050. In Papua New Guinea, the level of urbanization increased from 1.7 per cent in 1950 to 13.0 per cent in 2014, and the country is expected to become 22.7 per cent urban by 2050. The proportion urban in Uganda rose from 2.8 per cent in 1950 to 15.8 per cent in 2014, and although it was in 2014 the worlds fourth least urbanized country among those with 90,000 or more inhabitants, it is expected to become 32 per cent urban in 2050, making it the 12th least urbanized country in the world.
Urbanization and national income
Chapter II noted that the level of urbanization is observed to increase across groups of countries classified by the level of income, with the population of high income countries in 2014 having a level of urbanization that is well over twice that in the low income countries (80 per cent compared to 30 per cent). It described the association between national income and the process of urbanization as complex, noting that the causal relationship between the two is likely bidirectional and that effective planning and policies are needed in order for urbanization and economic development to go hand in hand. Figure III.3 explores the associations between urbanization and income growth using country-level estimates of the proportion urban, urbanization rates and gross national income (GNI).
The top chart in figure III.3 illustrates the association between the percentage urban in 2014 and the per capita GNI in 2012 (the most recent year for which data were available for many countries). Among the low income group, most of which are located in Africa, a majority of countries had levels of urbanization well below 40 per cent in 2014. Although there is considerable variation in the level of urbanization across countries with similar GNI, which can be partially attributed to variation in the urban definition across countries, there is a clear tendency for the level of urbanization to increase as incomes rise. Among the high income group, nearly all countries had levels of urbanization well above 60 per cent in 2014.
While the association between national income and the level of urbanization is clear, an association between national income and the rate of urbanization is far less apparent. The middle chart of figure III.3 shows only a very weak tendency for the rate of urbanization to decline across countries with increasing levels of national income, and again, the urbanization rates vary considerably across countries with similar income levels, especially within the lower-middle income and upper-middle income groups. Chapter II showed that the population of upper-middle income countries urbanized fastest over the period 1990-2014 at an average annual rate of 1.8 per cent, driven largely by rapid urbanization in China. However, the country-level data displayed in figure III.3 demonstrate that most of the countries with comparatively rapid rates of urbanization were in the lower income categories. Of the 38 countries with urbanization rates greater than 1.5 per cent per year from 1990-2014, just 9 were upper-middle income countries; 13 were lower middle income countries; and 14 were low income countries.
The bottom chart of figure III.3 shows little evidence of an association between the rate of urbanization and the rate of growth in national income. Several countries in Africa urbanized since 1990 despite slow or even negative income growth, while others, particularly in Asia and latin_america, experienced rapid growth of national income concurrent with relatively slow rates of urbanization. The absence of an apparent association here is not to say that urbanization cannot stimulate economic growth or, conversely, that economic growth does not promote urbanization. Rather, it suggests that economic development is neither a necessary precondition for nor a guaranteed consequence of urbanization (united_nations, 2013b).
B. THE SIZE AND GROWTH OF THE URBAN AND RURAL POPULATIONS
Urban population size and growth
Just a handful of countries accounted for more than half of the worlds urban population in 2014, and most of the growth in the global urban population to 2050 will be concentrated in a small number of countries as well. Figure III.4 shows the contribution of selected countries to the global urban population in 2014, as well as the contribution to the projected incremental growth of the urban population by 2050. The countries identified by name on the charts are those that cumulatively account for 70 per cent of the urban population or urban increment, respectively.
In 2014, China had the largest urban population, with 758 million urban dwellers, accounting for 20 per cent of the global total. China was followed by India, with 410 million urban dwellers, and the united_states, with 263 million urban dwellers. These three countries, together with Brazil, Indonesia, Japan and the russian_federation, accounted for just over half of the global urban population. The addition of another 13 countries cumulatively accounted for 70 per cent of the global urban population in 201437.
Taken together, China, India and Nigeria are projected to account for 37 per cent of the increase of nearly 2.5 billion people in the urban population by 2050. India will contribute most to the urban increment with the addition of 404 million urban dwellers, nearly doubling the size of its urban population between 2014 and 2050. China is projected to add 292 million urban dwellers, although this increment is equivalent in size to just 39 per cent of the urban population in the country in 2014. Nigeria is projected to have the third largest absolute increase in the size of the urban population, adding 212 million urban dwellers between 2014 and 2050, more than tripling the size of its current urban population. Seven other countries--the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, the United Republic of Tanzania, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan, and the united_states of America--are projected to contribute more than 50 million each to the urban increment between 2014 and 2050 and will constitute together another 20 per cent of the total increase in urban population.
While Japan and the russian_federation had the 5th and 6th largest urban populations in the world in 2014, neither country is expected to make a significant contribution to global urban population growth to 2050. In fact, the size of the urban population in these countries is projected to decrease, despite anticipated increases in the level of urbanization. In Japan, the urban population is projected to shrink by 12 million (10 per cent) between 2014 and 2050, while the urban population of the russian_federation is projected to decline by 7 million (7 per cent) over the same period. Seventeen other countries are projected to experience a net reduction in the number of urban dwellers between 2014 and 2050, including 11 countries in Europe: Belarus, Bulgaria, Estonia, Germany, Gibraltar, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Republic of Moldova, Serbia and Ukraine. The other six countries with projected declines in the urban population by 2050 are Bermuda, Cuba, Greenland, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands and the united_states Virgin Islands.
Rural population size and growth
Much like the urban population, the worlds rural population in 2014 was concentrated in a handful of countries. Figure III.5 shows the contribution of selected countries to the global rural population in 2014, with those identified by name cumulatively accounting for 70 per cent of rural dwellers worldwide. India was home to the largest rural population, with 857 million, followed by China with 635 million. Together with Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nigeria, these countries cumulatively accounted for nearly 50 per cent of the worlds rural dwellers. Another eight countries had more than 35 million rural dwellers  Ethiopia, Viet Nam, the united_states, the Philippines, Egypt, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the russian_federation and Myanmar  such that 70 per cent of the global rural population in 2014 was concentrated in just 14 countries.
By 2050, the global rural population is projected to decline from its 2014 level, from 3.4 billion to 3.2 billion, reflecting reductions in the rural populations in around two thirds of the 233 countries or areas. The remaining one third of countries is projected to see growth of their rural populations between 2014 and 2050, and in some countries the anticipated growth is substantial. Table III.3 lists the 50 countries with the largest projected absolute increases in their rural populations to 2050, as well as the 50 countries with the largest projected absolute declines in their rural populations to 2050. Nigeria will add the most rural dwellers between 2014 and 2050  over 50 million, increasing its rural population by 53 per cent followed by Ethiopia, which is projected to add 39 million rural dwellers, for an increase of 50 per cent.
In proportional terms, Niger is anticipated to experience the greatest rural population growth between 2014 and 2050, nearly tripling its rural population with the addition of 30 million rural dwellers. The rural populations of Uganda, Burundi, Zambia, Chad, and Malawi are projected to more than double as well. Another eight countries are expected to see growth in their rural populations of between 70 per cent and 100 per cent between 2014 and 2050, including Mayotte, Mali, Gambia, the United Republic of Tanzania, Somalia, Comoros, South Sudan and Equatorial Guinea.
The largest rural population declines are expected in China, with a reduction of 300 million rural dwellers, equivalent to more than one half of the rural population in 2014, and in India, where the number of rural residents is expected to decline by 52 million, representing 6 per cent of the rural population in 2014. In proportional terms, Japan is projected to have the largest rural population loss: the rural population in 2050 will be 71 per cent smaller than in 2014, followed by the Netherlands (64 per cent reduction), Bulgaria (54 per cent reduction), and Belarus (51 per cent reduction). Of the 233 countries or areas, 52 are expected to see their rural populations decline by at least 30 per cent between 2014 and 205038.
C. THE RATE OF URBANIZATION
The rate at which the percentage urban grows or declines is called the urbanization rate. It is a function of the respective rates of change and relative sizes of the urban and rural populations in a country. Consequently, multiple scenarios of urban and rural population change are capable of producing rapid urbanization. Perhaps the most intuitive path to urbanization combines urban population growth with rural population decline. This urban growth-rural decline scenario is typical of what is underway in many countries of Europe and Northern America, as well as parts of Asia and latin_america and the Caribbean. But urban population growth that is concurrent with rural population growth will also lead to the urbanization of a population if the absolute increase in the urban population exceeds the absolute increase in the rural population. This scenario is underway in most of Africa and Asia. In rare instances like those observed in parts of Eastern Europe, urban population decline accompanies a positive rate of urbanization because the absolute decline in the urban population is less than a concurrent absolute decline in the rural population.
Figure III.6 illustrates the associations between the urban and rural population growth rates and the rate of urbanization for the period 1990-2014, by major area, for 201 countries or areas with at least 90,000 inhabitants in 2014. The average annual rates of change of the rural and urban populations are plotted on the horizontal and vertical axes, respectively. As with earlier charts, colours designate the major regions, and bubble sizes correspond to population size in 2014. In a departure from earlier charges, here darker shading of the bubbles is associated with faster rates of urbanization. The dashed diagonal line passing through the origin marks the points at which the urban and rural population rates of change are equal. 
For the period 1990-2014, most of the 201 countries or areas plotted in figure III.6 fall within the upper-right quadrant, reflecting the positive growth rates of both the urban and rural populations. This pattern was observed in 93 per cent of countries in Africa, 73 per cent of countries in Asia, and 77 per cent of countries in Oceania. In Niger, for example, the urban population grew at a fairly rapid average annual rate of 4.4 per cent between 1990 and 2014, while the rural population also grew quickly but at a slightly lower rate of 3.5 per cent, contributing to a positive, but modest, urbanization rate in the country of 0.8 per cent per year. The urban population of Nigeria also grew fairly rapidly from 1990 to 2014, with an average annual increase of 4.5 per cent, while the rural population grew slowly at a rate of 1.4 per cent, contributing to a comparatively rapid urbanization rate of 1.9 per cent.
Distance above the diagonal in figure III.6 corresponds to the extent to which the pace of urban growth exceeds the pace of rural growth and thus is generally associated with faster rates of urbanization. Rwanda, for example, falls well above the diagonal: it had the fastest urban population growth rate in the world from 1990-2014 (9.0 per cent per year) and, because the rural population grew at a much slower rate (1.0 per cent per year), the pace of urbanization in the country was quite rapid, with an average annual rate of change in the proportion urban of 6.8 per cent. In contrast, in Egypt, which falls just below the diagonal, rural growth slightly outpaced urban growth, at average annual rates of 1.7 per cent and 1.6 per cent, respectively, and the average annual rate of urbanization was just below zero, at -0.04 per cent per year.
Compared to Africa, Asia and Oceania, the urban growth-rural growth pattern was less dominant in other regions, characterizing just over half (55 per cent) of countries in latin_america and the Caribbean and less than one quarter (24 per cent) of countries in Europe. Urban population growth concurrent with rural population decline was more typical in Europe and Northern America, characterizing 48 per cent of countries. In Portugal, for example, the urban population grew at an average annual rate of 1.4 per cent between 1990 and 2014 while the rural population shrank at a rate of -1.1 per cent per year for an average rate of urbanization of 1.1 per cent per year. The urban growth-rural decline pattern was also common in latin_america and the Caribbean, characterizing 42 per cent of countries. In El Salvador the urban population grew at 2.0 per cent per year on average while the rural population declined at -1.0 per cent annually, contributing to an average annual rate of urbanization of 1.2 per cent.
Of the 201 countries or areas with at least 90,000 inhabitants in 2014, just 12 experienced declines in both their urban and rural populations between 1990 and 2014. Most (10) are located in Northern or Eastern Europe, including Bulgaria, Ukraine, Croatia, Romania, the russian_federation, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Latvia, the Republic of Moldova, Lithuania and Estonia. The remaining two are Armenia and Georgia, both located in Asia.
Urban decline that is concurrent with rural growth was exceptionally rare over the period 1990 to 2014. Just five countries were characterized by this scenario, including Kazakhstan, Micronesia (Fed. States of), Poland, Saint Lucia and Slovakia. In Kazakhstan, for example, the urban population declined slightly at a rate of -0.11 per cent per year while the rural population grew at an average annual rate of 0.4 per cent. In Micronesia (Fed. States of), the urban population declined at -0.3 per cent annually concurrent with rural growth of 0.5 per cent. Urban decline combined with rural growth contributed to deurbanization in all five populations, at average annual rates ranging from -0.04 per cent in Poland to -1.9 per cent in Saint Lucia.
Notably, modest rates of urban population growth can, under certain circumstances, accompany fairly rapid rates of urbanization. The Netherlands, for example, urbanized at a fairly rapid average annual rate of 1.1 per cent from 1990 to 2014, despite an urban population growth rate of only 1.6 per cent per year, owing to a substantial concurrent average annual decline in the rural population of -4.2 per cent. Japan saw a similarly rapid decline in its rural population of -4.7 per cent per year between 1990 and 2014,
  concurrent with urban growth of close to 1 per cent, but because it was already 77 per cent urban in 1990 (compared to 69 per cent in the Netherlands), Japans urbanization rate was slower at an average 0.8 per cent per year.
In the coming decades, urban population growth will continue to be nearly universal, but the world will remain split with respect to rural population change. Around two-thirds of countries are projected to experience reductions in the size of their rural populations between 2014 and 2050, while the remainder will see their rural populations hold steady or grow (figure III.7). Urban growth that is concurrent with rural growth is expected in a majority of countries in Africa (79 per cent), and will occur in 62 per cent of countries in Oceania as well. Urban population growth that is accompanied by rural population decline is projected for all of Northern America, 74 per cent of countries in Europe, 71 per cent in latin_america and the Caribbean, and 63 per cent in Asia. Eleven countries in Europe  Bulgaria, Belarus, Estonia, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, the Republic of Moldova, the russian_federation, Serbia and Ukraineas well as Japan, Cuba, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, are each projected to experience declines in both the urban and rural populations by 2050.
The association between urbanization levels and urbanization rates
The pace of urbanization in a country tends to be associated with the level of urbanization, with more urbanized countries urbanizing more slowly than less urbanized countries. Figure III.8 plots the average annual rate of urbanization from 1950-1990 against the proportion urban in 1950 in the top chart, and the average annual rate of urbanization from 1990-2014 against the level of urbanization in 1990 in the bottom chart. Colours denote the various regions, while bubble size corresponds to the size of the population in 1950 and 1990, respectively.
For the period 1950 to 1990, the tendency for the urbanization rate to fall with increasing levels of urbanization is clear. The fastest urbanizing populations during this period with rates of urbanization greater than 6 per cent were all small countries of Africa that were less than 4 per cent urban in 1950, including Botswana, Mauritania and Swaziland. Of the 71 countries with urbanization rates between 2 per cent and 4 per cent a year between 1950 and 1990, all were less than 41 per cent urban in 1950 and half were less than 13 per cent urban. Of those 40 countries that were already more than 50 per cent urban in 1950, close to half of which were located in Europe and Northern America, none urbanized at an average rate faster than 1.2 per cent per year between 1950 and 1990.
During the more recent period from 1990 to 2014, the negative association between the urbanization rate and the percentage urban persists, although there is considerable heterogeneity in the rate of urbanization at most levels of urbanization. For example, among the 45 countries that were between 20 per cent and 40 per cent urban in 1990, the average annual rate of urbanization between 1990 and 2014 ranged from -1.6 per cent in Antigua and Barbuda to 6.8 per cent in Rwanda. For three quarters of the countries in this group, the urbanization rate fell between 0.05 per cent and 1.8 per cent. Among the 52 countries that were between 60 per cent and 80 per cent urban in 1990, rates of urbanization were as high as 1.7 per cent per year and as low as -0.3 per cent per year. As countries become very highly urbanized however, the rate of urbanization must approach zero. 
Trends in urbanization rates over time
Over time, as the levels of urbanization increase in all regions, urbanization rates slow. Figure III.9 plots the average annual rates of urbanization for all 233 countries or areas as estimated for the periods 1950-1990 and 1990-2014 and as projected for the period 2014-2050. As in earlier figures, colours differentiate the five major regional groupings, bubble size corresponds to the population of each country or area and black bars mark the median urbanization rate in each region for each time period.
Across the five regional groupings shown in figure III.9, over the period 1950-1990 the median rate of urbanization was highest in Africa at 2.9 per cent per year, followed by Asia (1.5 per cent per year), Oceania (1.3 per cent per year), latin_america and the Caribbean (1.0 per cent per year, and, finally, Europe and Northern America at 0.9 per cent per year. The median pace of urbanization had slowed in all regions by 1990-2014, when the median rate of change in the proportion urban was 1.1 per cent on the high end in Africa and 0.1 per cent on the low end in Europe and Northern America. Continued reductions in the median rate of urbanization are projected for Africa (0.9 per cent annually over the period 2014-2050), while slight increases are projected for the remaining regions where those countries with negative rates of urbanization over the period 1990-2014 are anticipated to experience increases in the proportion urban by 2050.
As with the levels of urbanization shown in figure III.1 (above), there is great heterogeneity in the rate of urbanization across countries within regions such that the geographic location of a country is a poor predictor of the pace of urbanization. The fastest urbanizing countries in Europe in 1990-2014 were urbanizing at or above the median pace for Africa, for example. Also 17 countries in Asia (33 per cent) were urbanizing at rates below the median for Europe and Northern America. The degree of heterogeneity both within and across regions in the pace of urbanization is projected to shrink in the coming decades to 2050, over which time three quarters of countries are expected to urbanize at average annual rates between 0.2 per cent and 0.8 per cent.
Countries with the fastest rates of urbanization
Both in the past and in the future, many of the countries with the fastest estimated and projected rates of urbanization are located in Africa. Table III.4 lists the ten fastest urbanizing countries among those with at least 90,000 inhabitants in 2014, estimated for 1950-1990 and 1990-2014 and projected for 20142050. For 1950-1990, seven of the ten fastest urbanizing countries were located in Africa. Botswana urbanized the fastest over that period at an average annual rate of 6.8 percent, followed by Mauritania at 6.5 per cent and Swaziland at 6.1 per cent. The three non-African countries included among the ten fastest urbanizing from 1950-1990 are Papua New Guinea in Oceania, which urbanized at an average annual rate of 5.4 per cent, and Bhutan and Oman in Asia, both with urbanization rates of 5.1 per cent per year.

For 1990-2014, four of the 10 fastest urbanizing countries were in Africa, including Rwanda, Burkina Faso, Lesotho and Burundi. Another five were located in Asia, including the Lao Peoples Dem. Republic, Bhutan, Nepal, China and Indonesia. The remaining country among the ten fastest urbanizing was Haiti. Rwanda urbanized the fastest during the period 1990-2014, with an average annual increase in the proportion urban of 6.8 per cent. Rwanda was followed by Lao Peoples Democratic Republic at 3.7 per cent, and Bhutan at 2.5 per cent.
The fastest rates of urbanization over the period 2014-2050 are projected to be slower than those in the past. Burundi is projected to urbanize fastest in the coming decades, at an average annual rate of 2.2 per cent, followed by Uganda and Ethiopia, which are projected to urbanize at 2.0 per cent per year and 1.9 per cent per year, respectively. Nine of the ten countries with the fastest projected urbanization rates between 2014 and 2050 are located in Africa. The exception is Nepal, which is projected to urbanize at an average annual rate of 1.9 per cent over that period.
Countries with negative rates of urbanization
Reductions in the proportion urban were unusual over the period from 1950-1990, but became more common over the period 1990-2014. No country is expected to experience a decline in the proportion urban between 2014 and 2050. Table III.5 lists countries or areas with at least 90,000 inhabitants in 2014 and that experienced reductions in the proportion urban over the period 1990-2014.
From 1990 to 2014, 33 countries experienced net declines in the proportion urban as reflected in the negative rates of urbanization. With the exception of Northern America, all of the major areas are represented on this list, which includes nine countries each in Asia and Europe, six countries in latin_america and the Caribbean, five in Africa and four in Oceania. Average annual rates of urbanization over 1990-2014 among the 33 countries range from -1.93 per cent in Saint Lucia to -0.02 per cent in Iraq.
IV. PATTERNS OF CITY GROWTH
Planning and preparing for the growth of cities of various sizes is essential to maximize the benefits of urbanization and promote sustainable development. Numerous factors can affect the size and growth of cities and the drivers of city growth can vary tremendously both within and across countries as well as over time. Thus, patterns of city size and growth themselves show great variation over space and time. The estimates and projections of the populations of the 1,692 cities or urban agglomerations with 300,000 or more inhabitants in 2014 published in the 2014 Revision of the World Urbanization Prospects, presented in this chapter, illustrate the wide diversity in city growth patterns around the world.
A. PATTERNS OF CITY GROWTH OVER TIME
Planning for efficient, sustainable and functional cities requires consideration of multiple dimensions of city growth. Cities can be basically described according to the changing size of the population contained within its boundaries or with respect to the extent of the built-up area that the population occupies. While it is possible for a city population to grow without concurrent expansion of the land area, that is built-up through increasing population density (i.e., ratio of the total population of the city to the total urban land cover), the overall process more typically occurs with some expansion of the urban extent to accommodate the growing number of city dwellers. Some cities have high average population densities (for example, Dhaka, in Bangladesh or Hong Kong, SAR) while others are spread out over a broad territory or around multiple disparate hubs (for example, Antananarivo in Madagascar, Beijing in China, Johannesburg in South Africa, Cairo in Egypt and Mexico City in Mexico) (Angel et al 2011, UN-Habitat 2010, OECD 2012).
Population growth is one of several interacting forces that help define the unique morphology of a city. Population growth can be both a determinant and a result of the evolution of such urban form over time. A short list of contributing factors might include city location and surrounding topography (such as coastline, mountain range, or river), economies of scale brought by agglomeration, population make-up and cultural preferences, pull factors for migrants, urban planning (infrastructure, transportation, etc.), and even the states institutional history with regard to the organization of its system of cities (Besussi E. et al 2010; Kim, S. and Law, M. 2012; Batty, M. 2008).
Because a citys distinguishing features depend on such varied processes, it is not surprising that there is important heterogeneity in population growth at the global level. Figure IV.1 shows the distribution of urban agglomerations across different categories of average annual rates of change for two periods. Only urban agglomerations of 300,000 inhabitants or more at the beginning of each period were considered.
Some cities have grown quite precipitously. Of 548 urban agglomerations with 300,000 inhabitants or more in 1970, very few cities (five per cent) have grown at high rates of 5 per cent or more per year from 1970 to 1990. Some examples are Dhaka (Bangladesh) and Lagos (Nigeria), each one with around 1.4 million inhabitants in 1970, as well as Brasilia (Brazil), with 525 thousand inhabitants in 1970. A similar percentage was observed during 1990-2014, although the total number of cities with 300,000 inhabitants of more had increased from 548 in 1970 to 960 in 199039. The cities with average annual growth rates of 5 per cent or more between 1990 and 2014 are located in Asia (36 cities) and Africa (6 cities). Of the ten fastest growing cities over that period, with growth rates ranging from 6.6 per cent to 10.8 per cent per year, eight are located in China (Dongguan, Shenzhen, Zhongshan, Foshan, Xiamen, Huaian, Shantou  and Yantai), one in Nigeria (Abuja), and one in the United Arab Emirates (Dubai). All but one (Fushan) had fewer than 1 million inhabitants in 1990.
The proportion of cities with low growth rates (of between 0 and 1 per cent) has also been relatively stable over time, having risen only slightly from 19 per cent per year over 1970-1990 to 24 per cent per year over 1990-2014. Most of the cities with low growth rates between 1990 and 2014 are in the more developed regions (Europe and Northern America) and Eastern Asia; only five cities in Africa had these low grow rates.
Some cities have seen their populations decline over time as a result of economic contraction, natural disasters, deterioration of living conditions, out-migration or persistent low fertility rates. In other cases, population declines are not clearly associated with crisis. For example, the loss of population in a number of cities in Western Europe, Canada and New Zealand did not appear to affect negatively the quality of living of the population (UN-Habitat 2012). In addition, smaller population sizes can actually favour sustainable strategies, such as the control of urban sprawl or the modernization of public services, or promote new collaborative governance with stronger citizen and local community participation (Schlappa, H. and Neill, W. 2013, European Commission 2012).
Figure IV.1. Distribution of urban agglomerations by average annual rate of change of the population, 1970-1990 and 1990-2014
NOTE: For urban agglomerations with 300,000 inhabitants or more in 1970 and 1990 (548 and 960, respectively).
The percentage of cities estimated to have lost population has remained steady during 1970-1990 and 1990-2014, at around 10 per cent. During 1970-1990, 57 cities with 300,000 inhabitants or more in 1970 experienced negative growth, most of which were in the united_kingdom, Germany and the united_states of America. During the more recent period of 1990-2014, 98 cities with 300,000 inhabitants or more in 1990 experienced population decline, mainly located in the russian_federation, Ukraine and other European countries. These include several capital cities, such as Bratislava (Slovakia), Budapest (Hungary), Riga (Latvia), Sarajevo (Bosnia and Herzegovina), Tallinn (Estonia), Tbilisi (Georgia), and
Yerevan (Armenia). Shrinking populations in Central and Eastern Europe has resulted from challenging adaptation processes after radical shifts in economic organization and performance, and changes in political regimes or economic policy (Schlappa, H. and Neill, W. 2013, European Commission 2011). In the united_states, Buffalo and Detroit also experienced net losses of population between 1990 and 2014, concurrent with a loss of industry and jobs in those cities, while New Orleans experienced population decline in the wake of the 2005 Hurricane Katrina.
Cities experiencing both demographic and economic declines around the world face important challenges for planning their urban policies, as they need to redefine their economic strategies while developing adaptive policy instruments to address the realities of shrinkage. During 2014-2030, the number of cities whose populations are projected to decline is expected to decrease to 45. Most of them are located in low-fertility countries with stagnating or declining overall populations, such as the russian_federation, Ukraine and Japan, among others.
As mentioned above, many factors may influence the size and growth of urban agglomerations across and within countries. Therefore, the initial size of a city is not a strong predictor of its pace of growth. When comparing the average growth rates of different sizes classes of urban settlements, only small differences emerge (figure IV.2). It is worth noting, however, that a wider range of growth patterns is observed among medium-sized and small cities, compared to bigger cities. The data indicate that this is generally true for both 1970-1990 and 1990-2014 periods. For example, half of the medium-sized cities with 1 to 5 million inhabitants in 1970 have had 1970-1990 average annual growth rates between 3.1 and 0.8 per cent, but other cities of the same size have experienced growth rates close to 8 per cent or negative growth rates of up to -2.0 per cent. During 1990-2014, half of the cities with 500,000 to 1 million inhabitants in 1990 have grown at rates varying from 2.8 to 0.5 per cent, but other cities of the same size had approached much higher levels or even declined.
Figure IV.2. Average annual rates of population change by size class of urban settlement, 1970-1990 and 1990-2014
NOTE: For urban agglomerations of each size class at the beginning of each period. 
The association between population growth rates and population size can also be appraised in figure IV.3, showing two groups of selected cities during the period 1990-2014. In the upper panel, 690 cities are shown, whose populations were between 300,000 and 1 million inhabitants in 1990.

united_nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs/Population Division
The lower panel depicts 270 bigger cities, with more than 1 million inhabitants in 1990. Similar proportions of high and low growth rates are observed in both groups. For example, around 1 in 4 cities in each group has grown at an average annual growth rate of 3 per cent or more, while around 1 in 3 has grown at a rate lower than 1.5 per cent per year (32 per cent of smaller cities and 38 per cent of bigger cities). Six cities in China and Abuja in Nigeria are estimated to have grown at average growth rates higher than 7 per cent. The relative number of declining cities is also similar; around 1 in ten in each group has declined in the period (76 smaller cities and 22 bigger ones). Some examples of declining cities are Riga (Latvia), Genoa (Italy) or Sarajevo (Bosnia and Herzegovina) among cities in the first group, and Budapest (Hungary), Seoul (Republic of Korea), Saint Petersburg (russian_federation) among cities in the second group.
Chapter II has shown that as the levels of urbanization increased, urbanization rates have slowed down. Consistent with this trend, and regardless of the initial size of their population, growth rates of most cities have fallen from 1970-1990 to 1990-2014 and are expected to continue to decrease during 2014-2030. For example, among all 144 cities with 1 million inhabitants or more in 1970, 67 per cent showed falling growth rates between 1970-1990 and 1990-2014. Among the 270 cities of the same size class in 1990, 71 per cent showed falling rates between 1990-2014 and the projection period 2014-2030. Similar percentages are found among smaller cities. Among 1,362 cities with less than 500,000 inhabitants in 1970, 73 per cent showed falling growth rates between 1970-1990 and 1990-2014. Among the 1,129 cities of the same size in 1990, 76 per cent showed projecting falling rates between 1990-2014 and 2014-2030.
Rapidly growing cities tend not to sustain their growth, as shown in figure IV.4 for large and medium-size urban agglomerations that had the highest 1970-1990 growth rates. The population growth of these cities (four in China, three in India and the rest in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Nigeria and the Islamic Republic of Iran) had slowed down over the 1990-2014 period, and are expected to persist downward over the projected period until 2030. For example, Shenzhenthe only megacity in this group witnessed a 43 per cent reduction in its growth rate, from around 18 per cent per year in the first two decades, to around 10 per cent in the following period and it is expected to slow down furthermore during the projection period to 2030. The growth rate of Malappuram in India has halved, and it is expected to decline by another half to 2030. Similarly, the pace of growth of the eight remaining cities in this group has declined significantly until present (five of them with more than 35 per cent decline). The growth rates of the four Chinese cities are expected to have the fastest declines in the group until 2030 (see Box IV.1 on the definition of cities in China).

BOX IV.1. DEFINITION OF CITIES AND CITY POPULATION IN CHINA
Unlike many countries where a city typically represents a permanent urban residential settlement, Chinese cities (shi) often reflect a political-administrative unit (PAU) covering an area much larger than the urban area, which typically includes an urbanized core surrounded by extensive rural areas (Chan, 2007; Shen, 2005). Only those PAUs at the county-level or at a higher administrative level can be granted a city status, which is normally determined the Ministry of Civil Affairs (MOCA) based on some requirements with an approval by the State Council.
Since the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the definition of cities has undergone four major official revisions in 1955, 1963/64, 1986, and 1993. The 1955 definition of cities was mainly based on population size (100,000 residents or more), the 1963 definition added the proportion of population engaging in non-agriculture as a criterion and the 1986 definition lowered the criterion for population size but added total GNP (Gross national product) as a criterion. The 1993 definition further added population density as a criterion. In the latest two definitions, population and economic indicators are considered together. The criteria were always slightly lower for minority counties, trade centres, locations of nation key projects, military bases, and so on. In 2013, there were 659 cities, of which 4 were province-level cities (Beijing, Chongqing, Shanghai, and Tianjin), 15 were associate-province-level cities, 271 were prefecture-level cities, and 369 were county-level cities.
The definitions of urban areas or urban populations of a city are generally set by the National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBSC). Six updates for the definition of urban population, mainly corresponding to the six censuses (1953, 1964, 1982, 1990, 2000, and 2010), have been made since 1949. In the 1953 census, all residents (i.e., agriculture and non-agriculture) in city districts of a prefecture-level city proper were considered as urban population. In the 1964 census, urban population was defined as non-agricultural population in cities or its subordinate towns, and so it was in the 1982 census. In the 1990 census, two criteria were employed. For the first criterion, the urban population of a city included: (1) all residents of urban districts of a city if the city is a prefecture-level city or above; (2) resident population of street (jiedao) committees if the city is a countylevel city; (3) population of all neighbourhood committees in subordinate towns of a city. The second criterion excluded those who were registered by rural village committees in (1) to (3) of the first criterion. The 2000 census definition added population density and geographic contiguity into criteria. The 2010 census dropped the population density constraint, yet the contiguity was broken down into the smallest administrative units (i.e., Neighbourhood Committee or Village Committee).
The hukuo (or population registration) system excludes de facto residents who do not have local hukou (mostly rural-to-urban migrants) from the regular local population counts of the city, which complicates the understanding of city population and statistics. Fortunately, the NBSC publishes de facto population in latest three censuses and in the China City Statistical Yearbook, which facilitates city population estimation.
Population estimates of a Chinese city in this revision of the World Urbanization Prospects mainly refer to de facto population living in urban areas of all city districts for prefecture-level cities or above, whereas it usually refers to de facto population living in city built-up urban areas and urban areas that are contiguous to built-up areas for a county-level city. Population estimates of an agglomeration may include some surrounding areas that are not necessarily contiguous to each other. Please refer to source of each city for details.

B. THE URBAN HIERARCHY
1. World population growth by city size
Over the past two centuries, a major change has been taking place in the distribution of the world population: the increasing and unprecedented concentration of people in highly urbanized areas known as urban agglomerations. The largest of these agglomerations, at the top end of the urban hierarchy, are those with 10 million inhabitants or more, and have become known as megacities. Megacities are notable for their size and concentration of economic activity, and account for 6 per cent of the worlds total population in 2014. The next size class is composed of large cities with 5 to 10 million inhabitants, which concentrate another 4 per cent of the global population. A full list of large cities and megacities at different points in time is provided for reference at the end of this Chapter (Annex IV.I). The other categories of the urban hierarchy are defined as medium-sized cities of 1 to 5 million, cities of 500,000 to 1 million, cities of 300,000 to 500,000 and urban areas with fewer than 300,000 inhabitants, which are home to 4, 11, 5, 4, and 23 per cent of worlds total population respectively (table IV.1).

NOTE: The change of the population in each size class from one year to another reflects the growth of the population in existing cities of that size class and the incorporation of the population of new cities into that category.
In 2014, there were 28 megacities in the world with a total of 453 million people. When considering the global urban population alone, this means that megacities are home to only about one in eight (12 per cent) of the worlds urban dwellers (table IV.2). The population residing in megacities has been growing quickly, reflecting both the growth of the dwellers of existing megacities and an increase in the number of megacities from 3 in 1970 to 10 in 1990 and 28 in 2014. Indeed, the population of urban settlements classified by any size class grows at different paces as a result of two factors: the growth of the population in existing cities of such size class, and the incorporation of new cities into that category, that is, the changing number of cities.
Table IV.2 and figure IV.5 include the changing numbers of cities by size class of urban settlement, together with the population in each size class. The vertical axis of the figure shows the share of urban population, while the columns illustrate the distribution of urban dwellers living in various city sizes in different for years 1970, 1990, 2014 and 2030. The existing and expected number of cities is depicted in each city size bar. The number of megacities has increased significantly: it tripled from three in 1970 to
In contrast to megacities, urban settlements with fewer than 500,000 inhabitants are home to about half of the worlds urban population. The share of the urban population living in small urban settlements (the first two categories) is projected to drop slightly by 2030, and consequently, the percentage of people living in larger cities will rise, though marginally. Though the distribution of cities classes changes slowly overall, the size of the population and the number of cities in each category are projected to increase significantly. For example, by 2030, 558 medium-sized cities of 1 to 5 million inhabitants are expected to host 1.1 billion people worldwide, that is, 141 more such cities than today. Approximately 200 more cities of 500,000 to 1 million inhabitants are expected to host almost 150 million more people than in 2014.

Figure IV.5. Distribution of the worlds urban population by size class of urban settlement and number of cities, 1970, 1990, 2014 and 2030
2. Population growth by city size and development level
The proportion of the population living in various urban hierarchies differs across development groups. Because of the higher overall level of urbanization in the more developed regions, the proportions of their total population living in urban settlements of any city sizes are larger than the equivalent proportions in the less developed regions. In both more developed and less developed regions, the largest shares of the urban population live in small towns and cities with fewer than 300,000 inhabitants. These urban areas have accounted for the largest proportion of the urban population, surpassing the proportion living in any other category (table IV.2, above). More specifically, in the more developed regions, small towns and cities are home to 435 million population or 44 per cent of the urban population. In less developed regions, while this proportion is similar today (43 per cent), it has been higher in past decades, consistent with lower overall levels of urbanization. In the least developed countries (LDCs), over half of the urban population (51 per cent) lives in urban areas of less than 300,000 inhabitants.
The share of the urban population by city class in more developed and less developed regions is derived from different patterns of distribution of cities across the urban hierarchy. Similarly to figure IV.5, figure IV.6 shows the distribution of urban population and the number of cities by city class, here classified by development group, for three points in time. In 1970 there was no megacity in the less developed regions, but by 2014 less developed regions hosted the majority of the worlds megacities. By 2030, 13 new megacities are expected to emerge in the less developed regions: Ahmadabad, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad (India), Bangkok (Thailand), Bogota (Columbia), Chengdu (China), Dar es Salaam (United Republic of Tanzania), Johannesburg (South Africa), Lahore (Pakistan), Lima (Peru), Luanda (Angola), and Thanh Pho Ho Chi Minh (Vietnam).
Figure IV.6. Distribution of the urban population by size class of urban settlement and number of cities by development group, 1970, 2014 and 2030
Large cities with 5 to 10 million inhabitants account for a small but growing number of urban agglomerations. In 2014, just over 300 million people lived in 43 large cities of that size. Two-thirds of these cities are in less developed regions, such as Santiago (6.5 million) and Singapore (5.5 million). The number of large cities is expected to grow to 63 by 2030 and house more than 430 million inhabitants, 92 million in more developed regions and more than 340 million in less developed regions. A majority of these new additional large cities will arise in the less developed regions, particularly in LDCs, where the number of cities is estimated to multiply by tenfold  from one to 10  and total inhabitants will grow from 5 million in 2014 to 63 million in 2030. Examples of such projected new cities are Addis Ababa (Ethiopia), Chittagong (Bangladesh), Dakar (Senegal), Kabul (Afghanistan), and Yangon (Myanmar).
One in five urban dwellers worldwide lives in 417 medium-sized cities with 1 million to 5 million inhabitants. Only 100 of these 417 cities are in developed regions. While considered medium-sized by global standards, these cities are in fact the largest cities in 79 countries. Examples include Sydney (4.5 million) in Australia, Addis Ababa (3.2 million) in Ethiopia and Montevideo (1.7 million) in Uruguay. By 2030, new medium-sized cities are projected to emerge in both less developed regions (Cebu City, Philippines and Chihuahua, Mexico) and more developed regions (Oslo, Norway and Toulouse, France). Altogether, a total of 446 medium-sized cities are expected to host almost one-fourth of the urban population of developing countries in 2030. 
Cities of 500,000 to 1 million inhabitants account for only 5 per cent of the worlds population today with 363 million total inhabitants, which include places such as Florence (Italy), Jerusalem (Israel), Lilongwe (Malawi), and Winnipeg (Canada). By 1970, more developed regions had 97 such cities, 8 more than less developed regions. The total number of such cities was 525 in 2014 but that number projected to increase to 731 by 2030, of which more than three-quarter will be in todays less developed regions.
Cities with 300,000 to 500,000 inhabitants account for the smallest share of worlds urban dwellers and are expected, on the whole, to experience high population growth in the least developed countries, with a forecasted growth rate of 3 per cent per year from today to 2030. Although relatively small, this city size is the most populous in a few countries, such as, Tirane (Albania), Al-Manamah (Bahrain) and Tallinn (Estonia). In terms of current total number of cities, the less developed regions host 3 times the number in the developed regions. Worldwide, the number is forecasted to rise from 679 in 2014 to 832 in 2030, of which three-quarter are found in todays less developed regions.
At the bottom end of the urban hierarchy, urban areas with fewer than 300,000 inhabitants have the largest share of global urban population, with 43 per cent in 2014. As noted above, they are also home to large proportions of urban population in both development groups. While this share is projected to shrink slightly over time, by 2030, these small towns and cities will still be home to 41 per cent (436 million) and 38 per cent (1.5 billion) of urban dwellers in the more developed regions and less developed regions respectively.
In summary, most of the growth in urban areas has occurred and will continue to occur in the less developed regions. In recent decades, megacities in the less developed regions experienced the fastest annual rate of population growth but in the coming decades, large cities in the LDCs will experience the most rapid rates of population growth. More specifically, the population living in megacities of the less developed regions have increased from 75 million to 331 million inhabitants during the period 19902014, reflecting both the growth within megacities and the addition of new cities. During 2014-2030, the number of large cities in the least developed countries will be increasing substantially, so that their overall population is expected to grow from 5 million to 63 million people. In the more developed regions, with an existing high proportion of urban dwellers, the growth rates are expected to be low, as the number of people living in urban areas will rise only slightly in the next 15 years.
3. Population growth by city size and level of income
As noted in Chapter II, in many countries there is a positive relationship between the level of urbanization and the national per capita income. However, the mechanisms involved in both urbanization and economic growth are complex and diverse across countries. Hence, there is no clear evidence about the strength or the direction of the relationship between both processes. Likewise, some association is observed between distributions of the urban hierarchy and the income groups of countries.
Table IV.3 and figure IV.7 show the distributions of urban dwellers by size class of urban settlements for countries classified according to income groups. The number of cities found in each category is also depicted. The classification of countries by income level has been maintained unchanged over time. In 1970, todays high-income countries hosted the only three existing megacities (Tokyo, Osaka and New York-Newark). At the other end of the income groupings, the largest cities in low-income countries were three medium-sized cities, namely, Kinshasa in DRC (with 1.1 million inhabitants), Dhaka in Bangladesh (with 1.4 million inhabitants), and Yangon in Myanmar (with 1.9 million inhabitants). In 2014, most megacities and large cities are located in high-income countries and upper-middle-income countries of today. High-income countries have 7 megacities (122 million inhabitants) and 16 large cities (104 million inhabitants), while upper-middle-income countries have 11 megacities (172 million inhabitants) and 19
  large cities (135 million inhabitants) in 2014. In the coming decades, while no new megacity is expected to emerge in the high-income countries, 12 more megacities are expected to arise in middle income countries by 2030, 6 in each sub-category of countries (from 11 megacities to 17 in the upper-middleincome countries and from 8 megacities to 14 in the lower-middle-income countries).
In sum, despite some similarities across income groups, high-income and upper-middle-income countries, on the one hand, and lower-middle-income and low-income countries, on the other hand, have more alike distributions of city classes in 2014. Not surprisingly, each sub-category of middle-income countries (upper and lower) is closer to the respective category in the highest and lowest ends. The first two (the upper categories) exhibit the smallest differences. The second two (the lower categories) have higher shares of urban residents living in small urban areas: close to half of their urban populations live in settlements with fewer than 300,000 inhabitants.
In the coming decades, the distributions of all categories are expected to change. The share of the smaller urban areas will shrink when cities will be growing for all income groups. By 2030, an increasing share of urban population of lower-middle-income countries will be concentrated in 14 megacities (18 per cent), a share larger than any other income groups. In low-income countries, the number of residents in megacities will have grown fast, from 28 million today to 58 million in 2030. Three megacities are expected in todays low-income countries: Dhaka (Bangladesh) with estimated 27.4 million inhabitants in 2030, Kinshasa (Democratic Republic of the Congo) with close to 20 million, and Dar es Salaam (United Republic of Tanzania) with 10.1 million inhabitants. However, a relatively high percentage of the urban population (44 per cent) is expected to continue to reside in small urban areas with fewer than 300,000 inhabitants. 
Figure IV.7. Distribution of the urban population by size class of urban settlement and number of cities by income group of countries, 1970, 2014 and 2030
NOTE: The country classification by income level is based on 2012 GNI per capita from the world_bank and it is kept unchanged throughout the projection.
4. Population growth by city size and major area
Differences in the distribution of the population across the urban hierarchy between income groups are accentuated when the focus is on major areas. In fact, geographical areas and income groups are associated to some extent. For example, the vast majority of African countries are either low-income or lower-middle income countries (27 and 16 countries respectively). Ten African countries (among which all Northern African countries) are included in the upper-middle income category and only Equatorial Guinea is a high-income country. In Asia, the distribution of countries is relatively even between the highand middle-income levels: 14 are high-income countries, 12 are high-middle income countries and 16 are lower-middle income countries. Only eight are low-income countries. All countries and areas in Northern America and most in Europe are considered to have high income levels. In latin_america and the Caribbean, more than one third of countries are included in the upper-middle income category. Still, close to 30 per cent are higher-income countries, most of which are in the Caribbean. Seven countries in Central and South America are lower-middle income countries and Haiti is the only low-income country in the region. Oceania is a heterogeneous region in term of income classification of countries: equal numbers of countries have been classified as in the high, upper-middle, and lower-middle categories.
Regions or major areas differ in their level of urbanization and the distribution of their populations across the urban hierarchy varies as well. Asia and Europe differ greatly in terms of the distribution of their respective urban dwellers (tables IV.4 and figure IV.8). Although the urbanization level in Asia is  relatively low (with 53 per cent of the total population living in rural areas), the number of people living in urban areas is almost four times higher than in Europe. In addition, Asia dominates in the number and total population of megacities; however, because of the size of its total population, the proportion of the population residing in megacities in Asia is comparable to other major areas such as latin_america and the Caribbean and Northern America. Europe, although highly urbanized, has a high percentage of urban dwellers living in smaller urban centres (66 per cent reside in cities and urban areas of less than 500,000 inhabitants). Yet, while Europe did not have any megacity in 1990, today 33 million people live in three European megacities (London, Paris and Moscow). By comparison, latin_america and the Caribbean had already 3 megacities in 1990 and is expected to double the number by 2030.
latin_america and the Caribbean and Africa also exhibit significant contrasts, as the former is the mostly urbanized region after Northern America (almost 80 per cent of the population is urban), while the latter is the least urbanized region in the world (40 per cent). However, considering the urban population only, the distribution across various city sizes of both regions is comparable today. Similar proportions of population reside in medium-sized cities, cities of 500,000 to 1 million inhabitants and cities of 300,000 to 500,000. Yet, because of the rapid population growth in Africa, the picture is likely to change in the next decade. The number of megacities and large cities of 5 million to 10 million inhabitants in Africa is expected to increase from 5 today to 18 by 2030 at which point, the distribution by city class will resemble those found today in Asia or latin_america and the Caribbean.
Northern America and Oceania, with the smallest urban populations of all regions, are notably dissimilar in terms of their urban hierarchy or size of their urban populations. No mega or large city is found in Oceania today, but 2 large cities are expected to exceed 10 million people by 2030. In contrast, over 35 per cent of urban dwellers in Northern America live in cities with fewer than 500,000 inhabitants, while another 40 per cent live in cities of 500,000 to 1 million inhabitants and of 1 to 5 million inhabitants. The remaining 25 per cent live in large cities and megacities.
As mentioned above, population growth is determined by both the population change in existing cities of each size class and the graduation of cities from one category to another. The fastest growing populations are found in Africa and Asia and this trend is expected to continue in the coming years. In Africa, the highest growth between 1990 and 2014 was experienced by the population living in mediumsized cities, considering that the number of such cities more than doubled during the period, from 23 to 50. In the coming decades, the highest growth rates will shift to the population living in African large cities and megacities, as the total urban population in Africa is projected to increase by 70 per cent (315 millions), and the distribution of urban dwellers is increasingly skewed towards larger cities. On the other hand, Asia experienced fast population growth across all city sizes from megacities to cities of 500,000 to 1 million inhabitants between 1990 and 2014. In the coming decades, such growth is likely to slow down, with the highest growth expected to be experienced by the population living in existing and new megacities, with a total urban population projected to reach 2.8 billion in 2030.
C. THE NUMBER AND GROWTH OF LARGE CITIES
In 2014, 18 countries accommodated 28 so-called megacities, that is, urban agglomerations with 10 million inhabitants or more. China and India, the two largest countries in the world, host six and three of these largest cities respectively. Brazil, Japan and the united_states have two megacities each, and the remaining 13 countries have one megacity each.
Todays 28 megacities differ in size and growth paths. They rank from 10.2 million to 37.8 million inhabitants and together they are home to around 453 million people, or about one in eight of the worlds urban dwellers. Over the past four decades, they have grown at very different speeds. For example, during 1970-1990, three megacities in developed regions, London, Paris and Osaka, expanded slowly, at rates below 1 per cent per year. In contrast, African and Asian megacities, such as Delhi, Lagos, Kinshasa, Dhaka, and Shenzhen had average annual growth rates above 5 per cent. During the next two decades until 2014, only a few cities grew faster than in the previous period, and only two Chinese cities grew at average annual rates of above 5 per cent. Over the projection period of 2014-2030, all but three megacities are expected to grow at lower rates than in the previous period. As a result, the absolute annual incrementsthe number of people added annually on average are expected to be relatively small between 2014 and 2030 (figure IV.9), while Tokyo (the largest agglomeration of the world) and Osaka (Kinki Major Metropolitan Area or M.M.A., with 20 million inhabitants) are expected to decrease slightly.
Figure IV.9. Absolute average annual increments for the 28 megacities in 2014 during 1970-1990, 1990-2014 and 2014-2030
NOTE: Cities are ordered according to the size of the absolute average annual increments between 2014 and 2030.
In contrast, the highest absolute increments correspond to Lagos which is expected to add around 730,000 persons per year to its current population, followed by Delhi (adding around 700,000), Dhaka (adding 650,000) and Kinshasa (adding 555,000). The projections for Lagos, Delhi, Dhaka, and Kinshasa megacities indicate that they may grow by 2.5 per cent or more annually.
When megacities host 20 million or more inhabitants, they have also been referred to as meta or hyper cities. Currently there are seven metacities worldwide. Tokyo is the worlds largest city with an agglomeration of 38 million inhabitants, followed by Delhi with 25 million, Shanghai with 23 million, Mexico City, Bombay and Sao Paulo, each of around 21 million inhabitants, and Kinki M.M.A. (Osaka) with 20 million inhabitants. Figure IV.10 illustrates the growth paths of these metacities since 1970 and their expected population growth until 2030.
Tokyo, the first to become a member of this unique cluster, had already reached the 20 million mark in the mid-sixties, while the remaining six have only very recently joined the group. For example, the other Japanese metacity, Kinki M.M.A., that includes Osaka and other adjacent cities, is the youngest in the group, with a population that is likely to remain roughly unchanged in the next decades (figure IV.10, top quadrant). Shanghai is the largest megacity in China and the third in the global ranking. Shanghai has been attracting population since the Pudong area was established in 1990 as a Special Economic Zone along the Huangpu River (Bracken, 2012). Today, Shanghai hosts 3.5 million more people than the capital city Beijing. Both Chinese urban areas are expected to halve their growth rates by 2030.
India has two metacities, Delhi and Mumbai (Bombay) (figure IV.10, central quadrant). Delhi, defined in this publication as the National Capital Territory plus some contiguous suburban cities and towns, has today 25 million inhabitants, that is, 13 million less than Tokyo and is the second biggest urban agglomeration of the world. This land-locked metacity has only very recently surpassed the 20 million mark, but is expected to reach about the same population as Tokyo by 2030. Thus, the phenomenal population expansion of Delhi after the partition of the country has led to high population growth rates of about 5 per cent during 1970-1990, which are not expected to fall below 2 per cent in the projection period until 2030. Mumbai (Bombay) outnumbered Delhi until the early 2000s. However, Mumbai is today in the penultimate place of the ranking of cities with growth at rates of about 2 per cent per year.
Mexico City and Sao Paulo are the two leading metropolitan areas in latin_america (figure IV.10, bottom quadrant). Since the 1970s, Mexico City has outnumbered Brazils economic and financial capital only by about 1 million people. Along with declines in economic growth driven by a process of deindustrialization in recent decades, Mexico City has seen a decline in population growth, with significant internal migration directed to medium-sized cities (UN-ECLAC, 2011). Population growth rates have also dropped in Sao Paulo during 1990-2014; however, Sao Paulo will take the top spot over Mexico City in the next decade, and by 2025, both metropolitan areas will reach comparable population sizes.
From 2014 to 2030, 13 cities are expected to join the group of megacities of today, so that by 2030, 41 urban agglomerations of 10 million inhabitants or more will host around 730 million people worldwide (table IV.6). The number of metacities, for their part, will increase from 7 to 11 during the same period. By 2020, Tokyos population is projected to begin to decline, although it will remain the worlds largest agglomeration in 2030. Delhi and Shanghai are expected to maintain their second and third positions respectively, while other Asian and African cities, such as Bombay, Beijing, Cairo, Dhaka, Karachi, and Lagos, are expected to move up several positions, as each of them reaches at least 24 million inhabitants (see the last column of the table). Both Latin American metacities (Mexico City and Sao Paulo) of today, and other cities such as New York-Newark and Osaka, will move down to the tenth and eleventh positions by 2030. 
Cities that are expected to surpass for the first time the 10 million mark before 2030 are located in countries that had no megacities up to now, except for China and India, who will be adding one more and four more cities, respectively. Several capital cities of Asian, African and South American countries will become megacities before 2030, i.e., Bangkok, Bogota, Lima and Luanda, along with former capitals Dar es Salaam (United Republic of Tanzania) and Ho Chi Minh City (Viet Nam), and other cities such as Johannesburg (South Africa), and Lahore (Pakistan).
Although most of the future megacities are expected to have declining growth during 2014-2030, some will continue to grow rapidly. Dar es Salaam, Luanda, Lagos, Kinshasa, and Dhaka are all expected to grow 3 per cent or more per year. Jakarta is expected to double its population growth, from 1 per cent during 1990-2014 to 2 per cent annually during 2014-2030. In contrast, nine cities are expected to grow slowly at rates below 1 per cent per year, while the population of two cities, Tokyo and Kinki M.M.A. are projected to slightly shrink.
D. CITY PRIMACY
The territorial spread of cities of different sizes throughout the national space constitutes, in simple terms, a countrys urban system. A countrys urban system can be linked to the organization of the government at the national, regional, and local levels (Kim and Law 2012). In turn, the urban system may determine the need for specific urban development policies, consistent with the size, growth and function of each city. In some countries, the largest city is home to a relatively high proportion of the urban population, which is known as the primate city. The interplay of forces towards population agglomeration and distribution makes the empirical relationships between a countrys existing urban system and its future development multidimensional and non-linear. While there is evidence to support a positive relationship between concentration of people and economic efficiency, research has also found that city primacy can create an unbalance in the urban hierarchy and bias development processes (Short and Pinet-Peralta 2009, UN-Habitat 2013, 2008).
In addition, the conditions under which primacy emerges can vary greatly and evolve with country size, population density, and the stage in its urbanization process, among other factors (OECD 2012, Short and Pinet-Peralta 2009). In small countries, it is easy for virtually all of the urban population to be concentrated in a single city. In those cases, the primate city may account for close to 100 per cent of the urban population. Even in larger countries, primate cities sometimes account for more than half of the total urban population. Changes in primacy can be affected by all of the factors affecting urbanization more generally, including reclassification and migration. In cities located in countries that have experienced civil conflicts, migration flows to and from the main urban centres during and after conflicts can occur and affect the relative size of urban agglomerations.
Unless otherwise stated, in this section, a city will be considered to be the primate city of a country when it accounts for at least 40 per cent of the urban population in a particular year and that had at least 1 million inhabitants in that particular year. Its degree of primacy will be measured by the proportion of the countrys urban population living in it.
Among all urban agglomerations with 300,000 inhabitants or more in 2014, three represent special cases of city primacy: Hong Kong, Special Administrative Area of China (SAR), with 7.3 million inhabitants in 2014; Macao, Special Administrative Area of China (SAR), with 575,000 inhabitants in 2014; and Singapore, a city-state with 5.5 million inhabitants in 2014. Over the whole period under study, these three special cases account for the total urban population of the respective areas; therefore, the degree of primacy reaches a maximum 100 per cent. Moreover, in 2014, these urban agglomerations equate to their respective areas, as no rural population is estimated. In addition to the three urban agglomerations with a maximum degree of primacy, five capital cities concentrate a high proportion of the urban populations of their countries, namely, Brazzaville (Congo), Djibouti (Djibouti), Kuwait City
(Kuwait), Panama City (Panama), and Ulaanbaatar (Mongolia), all of whom concentrate over 60 per cent of their urban populations in 2014.
Overall, 42 urban agglomerations in 2014 contained more than 40 per cent of the urban populations of their respective countries worldwide. The sizes of primate cities vary greatly, from around 400,000 inhabitants in Tallinn (with 45 per cent of the urban population of Estonia), to 18.4 million inhabitants in Cairo (with 51 per cent of the urban population of Egypt). However, most of these primate cites (27) are medium-sized or large cities, with at least 1 million inhabitants.
Table IV.7 provides a list of all countries in which primate cities accounted for at least 40 per cent of their urban population and had 1 million inhabitants or more in 2014. Primate cities accounting for large proportions of the urban population in their country tend to belong to small but highly urbanized countries, such as Kuwait and Mongolia, and to a lesser extent, Panama and Congo. Nevertheless, there is no strong correlation between the degree of primacy and the size or proportion of the urban population of the respective country (the urban population of countries are shown in the tables last two columns). Countries with primate cities accounting for around half of the urban population have different levels of urbanization. For example, Uruguay and Israel are among the most urbanized countries in the list, while Cambodia and Burkina Faso are the least urbanized countries in the list. Countries with primate cities with just above 40 per cent of the urban population vary too: some primate cities are found in large and highly urbanized countries, such as Santiago and Lima in latin_america, while some are located in small and lowly urbanized countries, such as Burkina Faso, NDjamena and Conakry in Africa and Phnum Penh in Asia.
The number of primate cities has declined from 50 in 1970, to 47 in 1990, to reach a total of 42 in 2014, suggesting that as the overall levels of urbanization of countries increase, there tends to be a greater diversification of the urban system, with the result that the preponderance of one city in a countrys urban system is eroded by the growth of medium-sized and smaller urban centres. This is illustrated by the fact that among all primate cities in respective years, the number of urban centres with a level of primacy of 60 per cent or more declines over time. For example, in 2014, only 8 of the 42 primate cities have this high degree of primacy. On the other hand, while there are today fewer primate cities than in the past, the number of medium-sized and large primate cities has increased over time, which is not a surprising trend as the process of urbanization evolves and the overall population grows. By 2030, all-sized primate cities are expected to be reduced to a total of 39, most of which will be medium-sized or large urban centres, with at least 1 million inhabitants.
Figure IV.11 shows primate cities in 1970, 1990, 2014, and 2030 restricted to urban agglomerations with at least 1 million inhabitants in the respective years. Seven cities are expected to sustain their primacy status throughout the period: Hong Kong SAR, Singapore and four capital urban centres -Tel Aviv-Jaffa, Baku, Lisbon, and Montevideo. Three other capitals  Bangkok, Seoul and Buenos Aireslost primacy after 1970, and Khartoum and Port-au-Prince lost such status after 1990.
Two interesting trends are observed. First, urban agglomerations with a high initial primacy level of approximately 60 per cent or more in 1990 lost their primacy level by 2014 or are expected to lose it by 2030 (except Kuwait City). Examples of such cities are Monrovia in Liberia, Kabul in Afghanistan and Beirut in Lebanon. Second, the opposite trend has been experienced by some cities with a low initial primacy level of about 50 per cent. Examples of such cities are Asuncion in Paraguay, Dakar in Senegal, Luanda in Angola and Yerevan in Armenia. Among the cities experiencing increasing primacy level, Cairo and Kuwait City achieved the highest increase with their primacy level having increased by around 10 percentage points from 1990 to 2014. Most cities that are expected to be primate by 2030 would have increased their primacy degree since today. Four capital urban agglomerations Asmara in Eritrea, Bishkek in Kyrgyzstan, Bujumbura in Burundi, and Dublin in Ireland are expected to be added as primate cities in the coming 2014-2030 period.
