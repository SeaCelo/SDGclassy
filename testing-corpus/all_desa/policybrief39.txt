 Global liquidity for global developmentOfficial development assistance declined in real terms in  as a result, in part, of fiscal austerity in many donor countries. Traditional forms of funding have fallen well short of needs to finance achievement of the Millen nium Development Goals, climate protection programmes and other global public goods. In the search for alternatives, there has been a reassessment of the option of using international liquidity for global development purposes.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) was empow ered in  to create international liquidity for its mem ber countries through issuance of a special multilateral asset called the special drawing right (SDR), and has done so thus far on three occasions (,  and ). sdr account for only  per cent of global official (nongold) reserves, leaving much room to increase SDR allocations. Even significant increases would have minimal impact on global financial flows, while  if properly designed  they could provide substantial additional buffers of international liquidity and development finance for developing countries.As discussed in the united_nations wess (WESS) : In Search of New Development Finance, annual issuance of additional sdr and/ or leveraging existing idle sdr could yield at least $ billion annually for development and global public goods. Such proposals have been made in the past, but have en countered political obstacles. In the light of the sustain able development challenge, the time has come to give more serious consideration to this option.Two ways in which sdr could finance international cooperationThere are two types of proposals for using sdr for de velopment purposes presented in the Survey. The first is based on new annual issues, with the SDR allocations bi ased or tilted toward developing countries. The second leverages developed country allocations for development financing by floating bonds backed by sdr, rather than by spending the sdr directly.A. New SDR issuance favouring developing countriesThis mechanism entails changing the existing formula to skew allocation in favour of developing countries, along with regular issuance of sdr. Developing countries would obtain more international liquidity, reducing the need for their own efforts to set aside foreignexchange earnings in reserve holdings to provide a buffer against global market shocks. Additional SDR allocations form a good alternative to borrowing on international markets or to running balance of payments surpluses to buy reserve assets such as united_states Treasury bonds.Under the current formula, which is based on the ex isting distribution of quotas (contributions and votes) in the IMF, about  per cent of newly issued sdr would be allocated to developed countries,  per cent would ac crue to lowincome countries, and  per cent to the least developed countries. If the IMF were to each year issue, say, between SDR billion and SDR billion (about $ billion$ billion) under a revised formula that would allocate, say, two thirds of the newly issued sdr to developing countries, these countries would receive be tween $ billion and $ billion in additional reserves annually. The proposed additional collective insurance would reduce the need for developing countries to accuFigure: Total net unused sdr , -(In millions of sdr), , ,,-Total Net Undrawn sdr (in millions of sdr)Total Net Undrawn sdr as Percentage of Total Allocations% % % % %%October  united_nations desa                        mulate reserves from their own resources, thus potentially freeing up space for enhanced developmental investments.Note that while this mechanism should help increase global stability, it only indirectly contributes to enhancing existing pools of development finance.B. Leveraging idle sdr of developed countriesAn alternative, more direct, channel would leverage the idle SDR allocations held by developed and emerging economies with abundant official reserves. As shown in the figure, idle sdr jumped from approximately SDR billion to almost SDR billion ($ billion) after the issuance of SDR billion in .One proposed option is to use idle sdr to buy bonds from multilateral development banks, enhancing the banks lending capacity for investments in development and global public goods, such as climate_change mitigation and adaptation. Using a conservative estimate, around $ billion of existing idle reserves could be utilized to purchase bonds. If combined with new allocations of between  billion and  billion in sdr every year, amounts in that order may be usable for financing longterm development on an annual basis.It should be noted that this development link does not require asymmetric issuance. Instead, the resources avail able for development finance would be derived from unused sdr allocated to developed and some emerging economies.An alternative would be to create trust funds to leverage sdr. In this proposal, $ billion in SDR equity could be used to back issuance of $ trillion in bonds, using a leverage ratio of  to . Assuming year maturity, this would provide $ billion for development financing per year. This could, for instance, meet the ini tially agreed needs for climate financing for the Green Climate Fund. The Fund could collect marketbased interest payments from at least some borrowers, which it would then use to pay its bondholders. As lowincome countries might not be able to afford such loans, the Fund would also receive additional annual contributions from donors to enable it to underwrite its concessional activities. Because of the relatively high leverage ratio, this proposal would require less frequent (or smaller) issuance of sdr.A high leverage ratio, however, exposes bond holders to greater risk, thus raising the cost of borrowing. An ad ditional argument against the use of such leverage is that it breaches the original purpose of sdr, which were cre ated solely for transactions of a purely monetary nature. Leveraging sdr in such a way as to expose their holders to risks of illiquidity distorts the purpose for which they were created. The viability of the proposal thus depends on how much risk would be involved, and on designing the financial instrument for leveraging sdr carefully enough to maintain its function as a reserve mechanism. For exam ple, if considered too high, the leverage ratio could be set lower and greater SDR issuance could be considered. The risks are further limited to the extent that the proposal is restricted to using idle sdr, which is similar to the ex isting practice of a fair number of countries of moving ex cess foreign currency reserves into sovereign wealth funds.The way forwardTraditional mechanisms of official assistance are falling well short of what is required for development and global needs, such as addressing climate_change. The international com munity must recognize that it is in the common interest to provide stable and contractual resources for these pur poses. Politically, tapping revenue from global resources is difficult. In particular, new issuance of sdr has proven to be a tall order, attested by the lack of SDR issuance for almost three decades. The latest special allocation, although already agreed in , did not pass the united_states Con gress until , when it was ratified as part of the Group of Twenty (G) responses to the global financial crisis.Changing the SDR allocation formula would also be a major political undertaking. It would require amendment to the IMF Articles of Agreement, which in turn re quires approval from  per cent of member votes implying, for example, that the united_states, which holds over  per cent of the votes, would have to give its approval. But like all political decisions taken for the next generation, this should be assessed carefully against alternative scenarios, including the very dangerous one of not con fronting global challenges.The proposed forms of SDR issuance and leveraging for development purposes are technically feasible and make economic sense both from the perspective of im proving the global reserve system that is based more on collective than individual country insurance against bal ance of payments risks, and from the perspective of dealing with urgent development and global public objectives. They deserve serious consideration.Prepared byShari Spiegel, Barry Herman and Rob VosFor further information please contact:Rob Vos, Director, Development Policy and Analysis Division desa, Rm.
