Globalization, Offshoring and Economic Insecurity in Industrialized Countries
 How can one dare speak of economic insecurity in the industrialized countries when the rate of per capita GDP in Germany is  times that in Uganda, the rate of unemployment in the U.S. is /th of that in Nepal, or when the share of population below the poverty line in France is /th of that in Zimbabwe? The question itself indicates that economic insecurity is a relative phenomenon. Those who are subject to a high risk of a sudden drop in income or wealth without adequate offsetting support are facing economic insecurity, irrespective of nationality or location. Hacker (, p. ) defines economic insecurity as a psychological response to the possibility of hardship-causing economic loss. He notes, however, that a feeling of insecurity is not enough to say someone is insecure. Insecurity requires real risk that threatens real hardship.
By many accepted measures real wage growth, inequality, labors share of national income, the incidence of long-term unemployment, the number of workers displaced by foreign trade and investment real economic insecurity in industrialized countries increased in the past years. The period has also been one of rapid globalization, with international trade and capital flows reaching historic highs. The role of globalization in heightened economic insecurity has thus become a major topic of debate in the advanced countries. Throughout the paper we focus on six countries: Denmark, France, Germany, Japan, the united_kingdom and the united_states. These countries represent a broad spectrum of the advanced industrialized world, and although all have expanded their exposure to international trade and investment they have not all experienced the same degree of increased economic insecurity. We also find that the perception of economic insecurity is strong in these industrialized countries, especially in the US and in France.
The risk from a high level of rea land perceived economic insecurity in the industrialized countries is borne by both the government and private households. Household consumption and borrowing patterns may reflect the burden of risk on the household private sector. This may partly depend on the private sectors expectation of government policy. While rising economic insecurity has in some cases resulted in increased demand for state-provided social protection, these demands have met various responses from business and government on the grounds that they raise production costs and reduce a nations international competitiveness. The new wave of economic insecurity has occurred in a variety of political contexts. Although offshoring has increased in all industrialized countries and raised the degree of economic insecurity on average across the OECD, economic security varies considerably across countries, largely depending on

 Offshoring is defined in this paper as the reallocation of production across various geographical locations to benefit from low labour costs and low taxes. In large part, this process has been facilitated by fast technological innovations in telecommunication and low transportation costs. The concept of comparative advantage has been redefined to place the emphasis on the ability of firms to coordinate a geographically dispersed network of activities. Levy (, p. ).
  
the institutions in place. The ILO index of economic security gives the following rankings for the six countries that are the focus of this paper:
As we will see below, German firms have greater investments in offshore production sites than the U.S., and France has a higher rate of unemployment than Japan. But since economic security is affected by the policies and institutions that influence market outcomes, Germany has a higher economic security rank than the U.S., and France ranks higher than Japan.

During the s a good deal of research aimed at showing that technological change rather than trade had been the principal source of labor market churning in industrialized countries. This paper revisits this debate in the light of the evolution of the world trading environment, involving emergence of new and larger trading nations in the developing world, development of sophisticated global supply chains driven by lead firms in industry, financialization of the non-financial corporate sector in the major countries, and implementation of a number of regional free trade agreements that lower trade barriers and extend property rights protection to foreign investors.
This paper addresses three central questions. First, what has been the impact of globalization, and specifically offshoring through trade and foreign investment, on economic insecurity in the industrialized countries? Second, what are the specific microeconomic and macroeconomic channels through which globalization impacts economic insecurity in these countries? Third, what political responses have best addressed rising economic insecurity without inflicting damage on other countries and in particular on the low-income developing countries whose export performance has been bolstered by the new wave of globalized production?
The main findings of this paper are:
 Since the mid-s most industrialized countries have experienced a rise in economic insecurity, and in many of them the burden of economic risk has shifted from the state and corporations to private households.
 There are different models of state-market relations with respect to economic insecurity, ranging from the limited state role in the Anglo-Saxon model to a heavy state role in the Rhineland model and a hybrid model of flexicurity in Denmark and a few others.
 International trade and investment increasingly occur within global supply chains, which have reached a level of growth and depth to constitute a new wave of globalization in which trade
 The index combines measures of job security and social security, where the former includes income security and voice representation security and the latter measures access to basic needs infrastructure pertaining to health, education, dwelling, information and social protection. See ILO ().
 The term financialization is used to describe the growing influence of financial markets and institutions on economic growth and development both in the domestic and international markets. It refers to a qualitative change in the operational logic of corporations and business firms away from productive investment and into financial investments where quick and larger profits can be realized (UN : ).
 The term flexicurity has been used to designate a social security model that includes some flexibility in the labour market for the hiring and firing of workers with high levels of support for displaced workers. It is a model that has been adopted by Denmark, Finland and the Netherlands.

and technology are inextricably linked to an extent not previously witnessed. Offshoring would be unthinkable without low-cost information technology, and information technology would not be as low cost if not for the effective extension of global supply chains into low-wage countries.
 The new wave of globalization has created new sources of gains from trade and new channels for transmission of economic insecurity arising from trade and investment. Moreover, as supply chains extend to high-tech goods and higher-skill services, there are massive possibilities for future expansion of offshoring, indicating that economic vulnerability will rise across all skill and education groups rather than falling entirely on low-skilled workers, as had been the case until recently.
 Spreading and sustaining the benefits of offshoring depend on the domestic reinvestment of efficiency gains that offshoring brings. While offshoring has contributed to the rise in profits share in the national income of most industrialized countries, they are also witnessing a fall in the investment rate, as percentage of both profit and GDP. Non-financial corporations are increasingly using profits to raise dividend payments, share buybacks and purchase of other financial assets, rather than making productive investment.
 Denmarks mix of labor market flexibility, ample social protection and active labor market policies so-called flexicurity has successfully raised economic security in that country despite globalization. The U.S. labor market flexibility, combined with relatively meager social protection in the face of rapid growth of imports from developing countries, has contributed to an unprecedented rise in income inequality and economic insecurity for a large share of the American population.
 Given the macroeconomic consequences of offshoring, flexicurity arrangements alone are likely to be insufficient to sustain high levels of economic security in the industrialized world. Trade protection has largely been avoided, but other policies involving redistribution and channeling of gains from offshoring to investment and growth are likely to be more important in the near future, as offshoring expands beyond low-skilled manufacturing workers.
 Finally, the provision of a solid and portable set of social protection elements does not reduce a nations trade competitiveness and in fact may raise it as increased worker security leads to greater possibilities for innovation and growth in productivity.
We begin with an overview of recent trends in economic insecurity and the different policy regimes in industrialized countries. Then we consider in detail how globalization and offshoring might have contributed to rising economic insecurity. We conclude with a discussion of the importance of combining creative macroeconomic and microeconomic policies in order to provide more security even as economic openness continues to grow.
. Economic Insecurity in Industrialized Countries
The period from  to  is widely referred to as the Golden Age of capitalism, but it may better be termed as the period of rising economic security for people in the industrialized countries. Not only did the OECD countries experience rapid growth in real GDP, but this growth was reflected in rising median wages, even more rapid improvements in median family income, relatively low rates of unemployment, falling inequality, and improvements in the post-GreatDepression system of social protection in most countries.
  
Since  the industrialized economies have grown more slowly, as productivity growth has diminished. As can be seen from Table , all six countries in our sample had higher GDP growth rates during than during -. In some cases (for example, Japan, Germany and France) the growth rate fell by more than half. Labor productivity growth follows a similar pattern. Over the entire OECD, total factor productivity growth fell to .% per annum on average after , from rates more than twice that during the twenty years before .

The productivity growth slowdown occurred as the process of deindustrialization continued in all countries of our sample except Germany, and in many cases the pace of deindustrialization accelerated (see Figure ). Manufacturing now accounts for between % and % of total value added in the U.S., U.K., Denmark and France. The two trends are not unrelated, as productivity in services, while difficult to measure, is widely recognized to be lower than productivity in manufacturing. Thus the increase in the importance of services in economic activity relative to manufacturing contributed to reductions in economywide rates of productivity growth. By some accounts manufacturing output growth is the main driver of productivity growth, following the so-called Verdoorns Law. Moreover, the manufacturing sector traditionally offered jobs with high pay and employment protection, often the result of effective bargaining by labor unions. Service sector jobs vary in their skill requirement and pay, but generally offer lower wages and less job security and employee benefits, partly due to low rates of unionization in services industries, an issue we return to below. As the share of services sector has grown in employment and value added, productivity growth has fallen, certainly as compared to that in the Golden Age.
 Howell (), Table ..
 According to Kalmbach et al. (), the German data overstate the size of the manufacturing sector because many services are counted in manufacturing.
 According to the Dutch economist Jake Verdoorn, faster output growth is associated with an increase in productivity due to increasing returns to scale.

More importantly for the purposes of this paper, the postperiod has seen a significant increase in worker vulnerability in many industrialized countries. The average rate of unemployment (on a standardized basis) has been significantly higher in the post-Golden Age era compared to the rates of the period. The extent of rise varies, ranging from slightly higher in the U.S. to more than five times higher in France, Germany and Denmark (see Table ). In most cases, the incidence of long-term unemployment (that is, unemployment of duration greater than one year) also rose (Figure ).

The slowdown in GDP and productivity growth described above not only brought higher rates of unemployment, but occurred along with a slowdown in the growth of wages. In the U.S., real median wages have been effectively stagnant since the late s. The result of these trends is that beginning in the s, the labor share of national income began to fall across many industrialized countries. Since most labor force participants are not owners of capital, this trend in the labor share captures in a broad way the growing economic insecurity in the industrialized countries.
Even more dramatic than the rise in income inequality between wage earners and profit earners was the rise in inequality across wage earnings, and especially in the gap between the wages of skilled and unskilled workers. The rise in wage inequality has been much discussed and is documented for our sixcountry sample in Table , which shows the ratio of wages in the top decile to wages in the bottom decile of the wage distribution for ,  and . Over the entire period, the inequality has been the greatest in the US and the lowest in Denmark. Since , France and Japan were the only countries not to experience an increase in inequality. In the other four countries, inequality began to rise after , more pronouncedly in the U.S. and Germany.

There are private and public responses to rising economic insecurity of workers. Households may borrow in order to insulate their spending patterns from earnings volatility. The rise in home equity loans in the U.S. and consumer credit in the U.K. are in part explained by such responses. Rates of household saving out of disposable income fell during the s for most of the countries in our sample (Germany and France being the exceptions), indicating the need for households to limit savings in order to maintain their consumption level (OECD, a).
Government responses to economic insecurity also vary greatly. The U.S. response was to privatize the burden of health insurance and pensions (see below). In other countries, there was a decline in unemployment benefits (Table ). Among the countries of the sample, only Denmark and France increased spending (as percent of GDP) on active labor market programs since , though in France the percentage has declined after  (Table ). Responding to the rising economic insecurity, governments have also made changes in regulations on hiring and firing. However these changes have gone in different directions, becoming less strict in Denmark, Germany and Japan, and stricter in France and to some extent in the U.K. (Table ).
 Temin and Levy ().
 Taylor et al. () find that the deterioration in the U.S. current account between  and  closely tracks the rise in health care spending by Americans. This indicates that Americans were not so obviously on a whimsical buying spree, as is so often claimed, but instead were trying to retain spending in the face of stagnant real wages and rapidly rising costs of health care.

More important than shifting the burden of risk are differences across countries in terms of the degree of labor market flexibility, level of unemployment benefits, spending on active labor market programs and the level of pension benefits. Economic insecurity is higher where state protection is lower and/or social protection is more closely tied with employment. By looking at these three variablesstrictness of employment protection legislation, gross unemployment replacement rate, and public expenditures on active labor market programs, we see some clear patterns in the government response to economic insecurity. We calculated an index of the strictness of employment legislation by setting the U.S. level of employment protection level as the base and calculating the relative levels for other countries. Similarly, we constructed an index of labor support by again taking the U.S. level of gross unemployment replacement rate and public expenditure on active labor market programs as the base. A scatter plot of these two indexes is given in Figure . We next combine these two indexes, giving equal weights to each, into a single index.
Based on the values of these indexes, five distinct models emerge and they follow closely the groupings presented in Boeri (). On the lower left corner we can identify an Anglo-Saxon model
  
of low levels of regulation on hiring and firing and low levels of worker support. To this corner belong the U.S, the U.K., Canada, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand. Countries on the lower right corner follow the Mediterranean model that combines relatively strict employment legislation and low levels of worker support. This group includes Greece, Portugal, Spain, Italy, and Norway. Countries on the upper right corner of the scatter plotthe Rhineland modelcombine relatively strict employment protection legislation and high levels of worker support. To this corner belong France, Sweden, Belgium, and Germany. In the upper left corner are countries with relatively flexible labor markets and high levels of worker support. We call this the flexicurity model, and its followers include Denmark, Finland, and the Netherlands.

NB: The Strictness of Employment Legislation Index has been calculated indexing the USA=, i.e. dividing the values of all other countries by the US value. Higher values indicate stricter regulation on hiring and firing. Labor support is an index (using equal weights) composed of the indexed (USA=) Active Labor Market Expenditures (as % of GDP) as well as the indexed (USA=) Gross Unemployment Replacement Rate. Higher values indicate a higher security level. Gross Unemployment Replacement Rate: The OECD summary measure is defined as the average of the gross unemployment benefit replacement rates for two earnings levels, three family situations and three durations of unemployment
Japan has always been difficult to categorize in these schemes because although the state supports only low levels of labor market and social protection, the private sector had traditionally supported longterm employment security. We would propose an East Asian model including Japan and Korea, both of which have greater employment protection than those in the Anglo-Saxon group in Figure . It would seem that the traditional role of the private sector in Japan has vanished to a great extent, as seen by the increase to European levels of Japanese long-term unemployment and involuntary part-time employment.
The flexicurity model has attracted a lot of attention because of a superior Danish performance in trade and employment and the unusual combination of policies, with flexibility in terms of hiring and firing and strong social protection for those seeking employment, including a high level of unemployment benefits and considerable levels of spending on active labor market programs. Moreover, Denmark greatly exceeds other countries in terms of pension benefits relative to lifetime earnings (Figure ). This system of flexicurity is in part the reason for Denmarks attainment of a high level of economic security.
 See, for example, Clasen ().

By many measures economic security is the lowest in the U.S., and this is supported by the unusually high perception of insecurity and fear of globalization in the U.S. discussed in the next section. The U.S., often lauded for the flexibility of its labor markets, also stands out in terms of its low levels of unemployment benefits and limited state spending on active labor market programs (Table ). Moreover, over the past twenty years, the U.S. has experienced a dramatic shift in the burden of risk, from government to the households themselves. This has resulted from more volatile household income, increase in health insurance costs, a greater reliance on private (as opposed to public) pensions, and a continuation of government policies of low levels of unemployment benefits. Hacker () describes these changes as the great risk shift, as governments and employers shifted the burden of insuring against a rapid decline in income to the employees and households themselves. In their long-term historical analysis of the U.S. income distribution, Temin and Levy () argue that this deterioration of the social safety net, combined with the decline of other institutions such as trade unions, has been a source of the decoupling of growth of productivity and growth of wages:
[...] the recent impacts of technology and trade have been amplified by the collapse of these institutions, a collapse which arose because economic forces led to a shift in the political environment over the s and s. If our interpretation is correct, no rebalancing of the labor force can restore a more equal distribution of productivity gains without government intervention and changes in private sector behaviour (Temin and Levy , p. ).
As an indication of the changes in the U.S., Table  shows union density in our sample countries since , with the U.S. experiencing by far the greatest decline. The U.K., following a similar model, comes next, though unionization in the UK even in  remained at a much higher level than in the U.S.. Frances low rate of unionization would seem to be deceptive, since bargaining coverage of union agreements has remained very broad.

The U.S. also stands out in the area of health insurance. The U.S. is alone among our sample countries in not having universal health insurance coverage. There were  million people uninsured in 
in the U.S., reflecting a steady increase in the number (and percentage) of people uninsured since the late s (Figures , ).

C. Perceptions of Economic Insecurity
Popular perceptions of economic insecurity do not necessarily reflect objective measures of insecurity, but we find a generally high level of fear towards globalization among our sample countries and especially in the U.S. and France. According to the German Marshall Fund (), % of Americans and % of Europeans had a negative view of globalization. About half of Americans and Europeans think that freer trade results in more job loss than job creation. Between  and  American sentiment turned more against freer trade while European sentiment became less skeptical of the employment benefits of trade liberalization. Half of Americans and a slightly higher percentage of Europeans saw the growth of Chinas economy as a threat. Across countries, the survey showed that the U.S. and France show the most skepticism toward international trade and investment (see Figure ). Of all countries surveyed, these two showed the high-
est proportion of respondents,  percent in the US and  percent in France, who did not favor FDI. This contrasted with % of English and German respondents who favored FDI. Adverse attitude toward globalization went along with pessimism regarding future. In the U.S., % expect the next generation will have a lower standard of living, % said job security had declined, and % said they have to work harder to earn a decent living. Most striking, % said that outsourcing work overseas hurts American workers. While this expression of greater economic insecurity was the greatest among those with less education, expressions of higher economic insecurity were found for all educational categories.

 Anderson and Gascon (), p. 
 Even on the issue of perception of insecurity, there is conflicting evidence. Kierkegaard (, p. ) shows that among
European countries there is not a statistically significant relationship between public anxiety over offshoring (as measured by the Eurobarometer  of ) and the intensity of offshoring and offshore outsourcing.

The contrast between perceptions of globalization in France and Denmark is clear from a recent survey that asked what comes first to mind when you hear the word globalisation? Fifty-seven percent of French respondents said that the word globalisation evoked the relocation of some companies to countries where labor is cheaper. Among Danes, % responded that globalization evoked opportunities for national companies in terms of new outlets (Figure ).
. The New Wave of Globalized Production
The international trading environment has changed over the last  years during which economic insecurity has increased in the industrialized world. The changes reflect political, economic and technological changes that have together encouraged more international trade and foreign investment, altered the structure of trade, and changed the relationship between trade and foreign direct investment. Expansion of trade during this period has occurred increasingly through sophisticated global value chains, as companies in industrialized countries went offshore to perform both manufacturing and services, while retaining in home countries core competencies related to marketing, finance, R&D and design. This type of division of labor has resulted in greater reliance on imports from low-income countries. It is true that these changes in the international economy began decades ago and have spread gradually, so that we are not witnessing a sudden shift in economic relations. However, the internationalization of production has deepened in such a way in the past  years that it is possible to designate this period as one heralding a new wave of globalization, involving both quantitative and qualitative shifts in the role of international trade. Economists note that trade can now be better described as trade in specific tasks and not just as trade in goods and
Globalization, Offshoring and Economic Insecurity ... 
services. Levy (, p. ) sees offshoring as driven not by comparative advantage but by firms ability to coordinate a geographically dispersed network of activities. He notes that offshoring decouples the linkages between economic value creation and geographic location. Higher imports of cheap inputs lower production costs considerably and raise profits of the lead firm, thus contributing to the rising share of corporate profits in national income. After a brief discussion of the factors that have driven this new wave of globalization, we then turn to an analysis of the variety of linkages between this new wave of globalization and economic insecurity.
A. Political, Technological and Economic Factors
Politically, perhaps the most significant development of this period was the entry into the capitalist world economy of former-Communist and other largely-closed economies. The collapse of the Soviet Union and of communist governments throughout Eastern Europe, Chinas evolution towards a market economy, and even the opening and liberalization of Indias economy, have all served to expand global productive capacity, international trade, foreign investment and international subcontracting. Freeman () has characterized these developments as the great doubling of the world capitalist systems labor force, as they added . billion people to the pool of labor seeking work under competitive conditions. Such an expansion of labor supply alone, Freeman argues, is enough to dampen wage growth in the rest of the world, including the industrialized countries. When such a labor supply shock occurs in a period of slower demand growth compared to the Golden Age period of -, the effect on labor markets around the world is likely to be significant.
A second, and related, political development has been the rise in the number of trade agreements, covering more countries than ever in history. Hundreds of bilateral investment treaties have been signed,
and numerous regional trade agreements have gone into effect. These agreements have contributed to the ongoing process of tariff reduction and removal of non-tariff barriers, aiding at the same time the globalization of production by providing protection to foreign investors. Meanwhile, the WTO has quintupled its membership over the original GATT. As part of this broad liberalization process, many developing countries switched from import substitution policies to export promotion, using a growing network of international supply chains. For example, export processing zones have expanded in scope and number, offering foreign firms long tax holidays on corporate profits and/or unrestricted profit repatriation. These regulatory changes generally increased economic security of firms while raising the vulnerability of workers in developed countries.
Rapid progress in electronic communication has facilitated the massive expansion of supply chains internationally, with lead firms investing abroad or subcontracting with foreign producers in order to reduce costs of production and/or better serve local markets. As supply chains developed and supplier firms gained in technological sophistication and scale of operations, the dichotomy between in-house or arms-length international supply relations has given way to a multiplicity of lead firm/supplier firm relations involving various degrees of investment, technical support, long-term contracting and monitoring. In some cases, large supplier firmsespecially in autos, apparel, electronics and serviceshave captured scale economies and developed modular production systems, enabling them to produce a range of related products, and allowing them to supply inputs and finished goods to many companies within a given sector and sometimes across
 Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (), p. .
 See Milberg (a) for an overview of the expansion of EPZs in the s.
  
sectors. In many cases, however, continual entry of new developing country supplier firms has resulted in global excess capacity, declining terms of trade for developing countries manufacturers, and enhancing the scope for lead firms to induce competition among supplier firms, further lowering lead firm input costs.
B. International Trade and Investment
The end result of the political, technological and economic factors described above is the rapid expansion of world trade relative to world output. Tables a and b show the trade shares of goods and services for the six countries under review. Since , all countries have expanded their exports and imports relative to GDP. Germany recently overtook the U.S. as the largest goods exporter, a feat that is especially impressive given the size of the U.S. economy compared to that of Germany. The U.S. imports however remain more than double those of the next highest importer. Though the U.S. has the highest value of exports and imports of total goods and services, it has the lowest ratio of trade (exports plus imports) to GDP. Trade in services, while at much lower levels in terms of value, has expanded faster in many cases. In , the U.S. ran a $ billion surplus in services, while Germany ran a $ billion deficit.

 On the variety of forms of lead firm-supplier relations, see Gereffi et al. (). For a discussion of modularity in global supply chains, see Sturgeon (). For a study of scale economies in first-tier suppliers, see Gereffi ().
 Milberg () calls this the endogenous asymmetry of market structures in global supply chains. On the terms of trade issue, see recent papers on the fallacy of composition in manufacturers export expansion including Mayer () and Blecker and Razmi ().
Globalization, Offshoring and Economic Insecurity ... 
The expansion of world trade in the past years has occurred, to a great extent, within supply chains, which can take the form of either multinational corporations (leading to intra-firm trade) or armslength relations between buyer and supplier. Evidence shows that both forms of supply chains have expanded since the s. The share of world FDI going to lowand medium-wage countries has grown steadily since the mid-s. At the same time, the share of intra-firm trade in industrialized country imports has remained relatively constant, indicating that the arms-length channel has retained its competitive appeal.
Foreign investment patterns have also changed. Traditionally, foreign investment was considered a substitute for international trade and a means for tariff hopping. Today, foreign direct investment and trade are complementary, since FDI leads to input trade within global supply chains. In addition, globalization of production has reduced, to some extent, domestic investment in the industrialized countries, since considerable production activity now takes place offshore. Taking the process to its extreme, many lead firms in the supply chains have divested entirely from manufacturing. All countries in our sample have seen a decline in the ratio of domestic investment to GDP since the mid-s. During the same period, the investment-toGDP ratio has ballooned in China, a point we discuss in more detail below.
C. Offshoring of Goods and Services
The growth in trade and FDI over the past  years is not simply a quantitative shift. It reflects a structural shift led by the accelerated growth of sophisticated supply chains. There has been a rise in offshoring by firms in the industrialized countries. Table  presents recent data for Germany, the U.K. and the U.S, showing that goods and services produced in offshore production sites measured as the share of imported inputs in total (non-energy) inputs, rose in the s. Goods produced offshore account for almost % of input use in the U.K., % in Germany and over % in the U.S. In case of Germany and the U.S., these levels reflect slow but steady growth in the reliance on imported inputs, growing by about % over -. For services, the ratio of imported to total input is still low, ranging between  and  percent, but the rates of growth are higher than those for goods in all the three countries mentioned above. A number of recent studies indicate that offshoring of services is likely to expand more rapidly in future than that of goods.
The figures in Table  measure trade in inputs and thus may understate the magnitude of trade within global supply chains. Global corporations in the major industrialized countries are not strictly involved in assembly. Much of the import activity in global supply chains is in fully finished goods. In fact, the purpose of corporate offshoring, whether at arms-length or through foreign subsidiaries, is precisely to allow the corporation to focus on its core competence, while leaving other aspects of the process, often including production, to others.
Many manufacturing firms now do not manufacture anything at all. They merely provide product and brand design, marketing, supply chain logistics and financial management services. Thus an alternative proxy for offshoring may simply be imports from low-wage countries. As shown in Table , Japan and the U.S. now rely heavily on imports from low-income developing countries (% and % respectively). While the analogous ratios for them are still low, all the European countries have seen in recent years a more than doubling of the share of their imports coming from low-income developing countries (see column marked low-income in Table ). The new wave of globalized production can be put in some historical perspective by considering imports from all developing and transitional economies since , as also shown in Table .
 On the location of FDI, see Burke and Epstein () and on intra-firm trade, see Milberg ().
 For some historical data on offshoring, see Campa and Goldberg ().
  
In , these shares were especially high in countries with colonial ties, such as France, the UK, and the US, and also in Germany. The shares declined for some countries during and -, but showed considerable rise during -, reaching % in Denmark, % in France, % in Germany, % in the U.K., % in the U.S. and % in Japan.

China is the export powerhouse, hosting much of the offshoring activity, and Indias boom in business services exports has now received much attention. Chinas export to industrialized countries has been growing remarkably, especially in the past ten years, reaching % of total OECD imports in , and continuing to grow since then (Figure ). In , the U.S. ran a $ billion deficit with China, based on imports of $ billion and exports of $ billion. Most of these imports were demanded directly by U.S. corporations, such as Wal-Mart, Nike and Mattel and a number of apparel, electronics and automotive companies. About  percent of U.S. imports from China are related party imports, meaning they are between parties with at least a % common ownership interest. Those without affiliates in China often order from large Chinese contract manufacturers or from vendors who subcontract to Chinese firms. In the electronics sector, Chinese production is dominated by foreign investors from Asia.

A. Connecting Globalization to Economic Insecurity
All six countries of our sample experienced an increase in globalization (by various measures) in recent years, and in almost all cases our measures of economic insecurity also increased, most prominently in Germany, Japan and the U.S.. Two countries (Denmark and the U.K.) experienced declines in the share of long-term unemployment and also had the lowest growth in involuntary part-time work (see Table ).
B. A Closer Look at Winners and Losers from Offshoring
Trade liberalization is known to create winners and losers, and the new wave of globalization is no different in this regard, although some of the mechanisms and distributional effects may be new. Figure  depicts the variety of ways in which offshoring impacts the labor market. Offshoring, on the one hand, lowers prices of inputs and outputs, raising the demand for both and thus the demand for labor too. In addition, lower input prices should raise profit margins and profits, leading to investment that should further raise productivity and output. These gains are labeled as the mark-up, and scale effects in Figure . On the other hand, offshoring weakens labor demand by replacing foreign labor for domestic labor, creating a substitution effect. It also reduces demand for labor by raising productivity, an outcome referred to as the productivity effect.
Not the entire rise in profits is recycled into investment and labor demand, and this constitutes an important leakage in the system. As we will see below, corporations may also choose to return their net gains to shareholders, and this has occurred through higher dividend payments and share buybacks. This strategy of financialization of the non-financial corporate sector also includes the purchase of financial assets and the acquisition of other corporations (merger and acquisition). Financialization represents a drain on labor demand and, as we will see below, may play an important role in the link between globalization and economic insecurity.

Figure  is a simplification that considers all labor as one type, and leaves out some potentially significant indirect effects. Thus in addition to the direct effect of offshoring on employment and profits, economic research has also considered the effect of offshoring on different types of labor (skilled and unskilled, through the Stolper-Samuelson effect), the increased sensitivity of labor demand to wage changes at home and abroad, and the greater use of company threats to move production abroad to undercut bargaining power of unions and laborers. We briefly review the evidence on each of these channels before looking at the overall relationship between globalization and economic insecurity in the industrialized countries.

C. Profits and the Profit Share
We noticed that offshoring is one of the reasons behind the recent rise in the profit share of national income observed across industrialized countries. Figure  however shows the flip side, which is the decline in the labor share. Note that the labor share in the U.S. has declined less than in other countries. This is partly due to the fact that the large levels of CEO compensation in the U.S., including stock options, are officially counted in labor income.

A number of studies have confirmed the role of offshoring in changing the distribution of income between labor and capital. Most firm-level studies find that offshoring occurs when cost reductions can be achieved and are at least % of the labor cost. Focusing on the data for -, Milberg et al. () find that offshoring intensity is positively associated with sectoral profit shares in the U.S.. A number of recent papers have taken up the question of trade and the profit share at the aggregate level. Harrison () studies the relationship between trade openness and functional distribution of income across a large number of countries and finds that (contrary to the prediction of Heckscher-Ohlin theory) openness is generally associated with a lower share of labor in national income. Harrison concludes that rising trade shares and exchange rate crises reduce labors share, while capital controls and government spending increase labors share. A study by the IMF () finds that offshoring is a small, but significant negative factor in the determination of the labor share of income for a group of OECD countries. In this study, three aspects of globalization (related to prices, offshoring, and immigration) combined to play a large role in explaining the declining labor share. The study by Ellis and Smith () finds no connection between openness and the profit share, but links the rising profit share to increased churning in the labor market. While the authors attribute this churning to technological change, it seems likely that it also results from some of the indirect effects of globalization discussed below.
 See Milberg (b) for a review of these studies.
Labor Compensation (in % of GDP)
Globalization, Offshoring and Economic Insecurity ... 
It is important to recognize that the rise in income inequality (between labor and capital) is not inconsistent with the theory depicted in Figure . As Mann () shows, offshoring may lead to positive net employment growth provided efficiency gains from offshoring are shared between consumers and producers and both these channels promote investment. The problem is that the increase in profit share has not generally resulted in higher rates of investment. In fact, as profit shares of national income increased, domestic investment has fallen, as can be seen in Figure .
There are a number of explanations for the decline in domestic investment. The simple fact is that less domestic investment is needed when significant portions of the production process (goods and services) are moved offshore. Thus decline in domestic investment of industrialized countries goes hand in hand with rise in investment rates of countries hosting offshoring activities, such as China (Figure ).

An associated phenomenon, also shown in Figure , is the leakage of profits to the financial system. According to a number of recent studies, the decline in investment spending in the corporate sector is also tied with the shift in corporate strategy occurring in the s, when the pressure on management was to downsize the corporation and distribute profits back to shareholders at a greater pace. This process of financialization that occurred in the non-financial corporate sector was supported by the possibility of moving operations abroad through foreign direct investment and arms-length subcontracting and focusing increasingly on core competence, a process that allowed corporate managers to reduce domestic investment in order to meet shareholder demands for improvements in shareholder value. Stockhammer () documents a marked increase in the share of non-financial corporations value added going to interest and dividends since the late s in the U.S., the U.K., France, and Germany. In a firm-level study of the U.S. non-financial corporate sector, Orhangazi, O. () finds a similar relation between financialization and investment. Milberg et al. (), also focusing on the U.S., show that the rising profit share, due in part to offshoring,

occurs as the share of investment out of profits falls and the payment of dividends and the purchase of share buybacks rises (see Figure ).

D. Job Displacement and Earnings Replacement
There are a variety of ways of studying job loss resulting from international trade. One of these focuses on old-fashioned direct import competition, that is on the employment effects of a change in net exports, where these employment effects are typically based on a comparison of actual employment with employment levels that would have occurred if the trade balance (relative to GDP) had remained unchanged. Sachs and Shatz () had found that trade reduced U.S. manufacturing employment by .% in , and Wood () put the figure at .% for all developed countries, with a relatively larger share of the decline borne by unskilled workers in both studies. In general, these studies find employment gains where net exports rise and employment losses where they fall. These studies focus almost exclusively on the manufacturing sector. In our sample, for the period -, the U.S., the U.K. and France experienced increases in their trade deficit in manufacturing, while Denmark, Japan and especially Germany had improvements. The deteriora-
 It would appear that the relationship between offshoring and financialization is not just in one direction. A study of U.K. and Danish retail firms shows that the financial pressures on the U.K. firms led to much stricter conditions being imposed on foreign suppliers of U.K. firms compared to Danish firms. U.K. retailers were more aggressive in seeking low-cost suppliers and in pressuring suppliers to reduce prices. See Palpacuer et al. () and Gibbon ().
Percent (%)

tion has been the greatest for the U.S., and Scott () calculates that the decline in net exports between  and  cost the U.S. the equivalent of . million jobs.
Another line of research looks at the employment effects of foreign direct investment. This however captures only a portion of the effect of offshoring, because much of it takes place at arms length. The results proved to be ambiguous. Muendler and Becker () in a study of Germany, Brainard and Riker () in a study of the U.S. and Fors and Kokko () in a study of Sweden, found a substitution effect between employment at home and in foreign affiliates. Desai, Foley and Hines () and Borga () found complementarities between employment at home and in affiliates for U.S. transnational corporations. Harrison and McMillan () find that the effect of FDI on U.S. employment depends on whether the investment is horizontal or vertical. Horizontal FDI, seeking to serve foreign markets, is found to reduce U.S. labor demand, while vertical FDI, which seeks to reduce costs, increases the demand for labor.
An important measure of economic insecurity is the ability of workers displaced by trade to find a new job and not suffer a loss in earnings. Kletzer () has done the most extensive analysis of the reemployment rate and replacement wage for workers displaced as the result of foreign trade. In a study of the U.S. from she found that earnings losses from job dislocation are large and persistent over time. Specifically, she found that . per cent of manufacturing workers displaced during and onefourth of those reemployed suffered earnings declines greater than %. For workers displaced from nonmanufacturing sectors the situation is very similar:  percent found reemployment, and  per cent suffered pay cuts of  per cent or more.
OECD () did a similar study for  European countries for and found that reemployment rates in Europe were lower than in the U.S., but a much lower share of workers had earnings losses greater than % upon reemployment and  percent of workers had no earnings losses or were earning more than before displacement. Table  compares the U.S. and European situations for trade-displaced workers.
E. Trade versus Technology: Skill-Biased Labor Demand Shifts
Labor economists studying rising income inequality in industrialized countries over the past years often see the explanation in technological change. According to this view, the introduction of information technology (IT) and IT-enabled tasks introduced a bias in the demand for higher-skill workers. The result of such skills-biased technological change was to raise income inequality, as the wages of higher-paid workers increased faster than those of lower-paid workers who experienced smaller gains or even, in some cases, a decline in wages.
Responding to the empirical findings, many international trade economists have reformulated the traditional two factor model of trade to allow distinction between labor of high and low skill. These models generally predict that trade liberalization would raise the relative demand for skilled labor in industrialized countries and thus raise the ratio of wages of skilled labor to wages of unskilled labor. These predictions are consistent with the observed increasing trends in income inequality in these countries. In sum, trade liberalization and technological change both can contribute to the rising wage inequality in industrialized countries. The debate concerns their relative role in the phenomenon.
Wood (, p. ) finds that that trade is the main cause of the problems of unskilled workers. (See also Wood ). As the main force driving the process, he identifies increasing specialization of industrialized countries in capital-intensive manufacturers, while developing countries specialized in the production of labor-intensive goods. Wood estimates that between  and , % of the increased wage inequality in the U.S. was due to trade.
Feenstra and Hanson (,  and ) follow up the above results with a series of studies applying the extended trade model to the case of offshoring. They find that changes in offshoring between  and  explain between  and  percent of the rise in the wages of high-skilled workers relative to the wages of low-skilled workers in that period. In a study of manufacturing offshoring in the UK for the period -, Anderton and Brenton () find that trade accounted for % of the rise in the skilled labor share of labor income. Geishecker () in a study of Germany in the s finds that offshoring had a significant negative impact on the demand for low-skilled workers, explaining about % to % of the overall decline in the relative demand for low-skilled labor. Head and Ries () estimate a similar model for Japan and find a strong positive correlation between the change in the firms non-production wage share and a firms share of employment in low-income countries. (Feenstra and Hanson, , p. ). In their summary paper on the issue, Feenstra and Hanson () find that offshoring accounted for -% of the rise in the non-production wage share (i.e. the share of wages going to higher-skilled workers), while computer services and other high-tech services account for % to % of the shift to non-production labor.
Further research could not actually resolve the debate concerning relative roles of technology and trade in wage inequality rise. Also, there has been a debate about the timing of the technological change. By some accounts, inequality began to rise well before new technology was integrated into production
For some early empirical analysis, see Berman et al. () on the U.S. and Machin and Manning () on the U.K..
Wood (, ) pioneered this effort. He argued that capital could be ignored since with high international mobility had little differential effect across countries.
According to the Stolper-Samuelson theorem, trade liberalization should benefit an economys abundant factor relative to its scarce factor. In a world of highand low-skill labor, the industrialized countries were clearly relatively abundant in skilled labor and thus could expect to see the returns to skill rising in relative terms.

Globalization, Offshoring and Economic Insecurity ... 
processes. Inequality actually fell during the late s when the IT boom was the strongest. It also became clear that trade and technological change are inter-connected, and increasingly so as global supply chains developed. For example, Wood (, p. ) notes that the pace and direction of technical change may be influenced by trade...So, however one looks at it, trade and new technology are intertwined: no story that excludes one or the other of them is likely to be the whole story.
Despite these difficulties, the increased magnitude of, and public concern over, offshoring have spurred much empirical research on the labor market effect of offshoring in the s and s. Table  presents a summary of recent research, which covers studies of the U.S., the U.K., Germany and a recent study of all OECD countries, and covering both the manufacturing and service sectors. These recent studies by and large support earlier findings: offshoring in the production of goods and services leads to the rise of employment and wages of high-skilled labor and fall in the employment and wages of low-skilled labor.
Some recent research has focused separately on offshoring of services and examined its effect on overall employment. This focus is important because it gets away from the narrow theoretical confines of the Stolper-Samuelson theorem and the difficulty of testing it, and asks a more general question. Their results are not fully conclusive, but they broadly indicate that across the OECD, offshoring of services has led to reductions in overall employment. See, for example, Amiti and Wei (, ). Similarly, Scholler (a, c) offer evidence of negative influence of service offshoring on German employment between 
and . OECD (b) measures the effects of offshoring for  OECD countries, showing significantly negative effect of goods and services offshoring on manufacturing and service employment.
The perceptions of a strong link between globalization and economic insecurity cited at the beginning of this paper are likely to be driven both by current reality and by predictions about the future. A number of recent studies predict a significant expansion of services offshoring. For example, Blinder (, a, b) has done a detailed analysis of the U.S. labor force, looking especially at jobs in services and the extent to which they are personally delivered or impersonally delivered. Personally-delivered services cannot be delivered electronically, such as child care or garbage collection. Impersonally-delivered services are those that can be delivered electronically without a significant loss of quality. These would include travel reservations and computer support (Blinder a, p. ). Blinder estimates that  to  million current jobs ( to  percent of the current American workforce) are likely to fall into the category of impersonallydelivered services, and hence potentially subject to future offshoring. Blinders analysis is notable not just because the potential labor market displacement is large, but because the displacement affects all skill levels of the U.S. labor force. Blinder sees the potential wave of offshoring as driving a new industrial revolution, so that the sectoral and occupational compositions of the U.S. workforce are likely to be quite different a generation or two from now. When that future rolls around, only a small minority of U.S. jobs will still be offshorable; the rest will have already moved off shore (p. ). Blinders analysis shows that the distinction between high-skill versus low-skill labor that characterizes most of the research to date, may be much less relevant in the near future.
 The theory has not gone un-criticized, both on grounds of relevance (see Samuelson, ) and on the grounds of the difficulty of measuring high-skill and low-skill labour (see Howell, ), and its weak predictive power for the case of developing (low-skill abundant) countries see, for example, (Berg, ).

F. Increase in the Elasticity of the Demand for Labor
Rodrik () and others have noted that greater openness to international trade would also raise the elasticity of labor demand with respect to both domestic and foreign wages. This increased sensitivity of labor demand to both domestic and foreign wage movements is another result of rise of global supply chains and offshoring. Anderson and Gascon (, p. ) describe the situation well:
Globalization, Offshoring and Economic Insecurity ... 
Traditionally, trade is thought of as exchanging different goods across nations, not the shifting of production from one country to another, followed by return shipments back to the original country. For example, in the past, U.S. firms would export good x and import good y. In the New Economy, U.S. firms export the capital k needed to produce good x to a country with lower production costs and then re import good x. Theoretically, disaggregating the value chain has allowed U.S. business to substitute cheaper foreign labor, increasing firms own price elasticity of demand for labor, raising the volatility of wages and employment, which increase worker insecurity.
However, there have been very few estimates of the relationship between trade openness and the wage elasticity of labor demand. Slaughter () studied U.S. manufacturing sector for the period of  and found that the elasticity of demand rose for U.S. production workers (a proxy for lower-skill workers) but not for non-production workers during this period. The elasticity increase was the greatest in sectors that experienced the most offshoring and technical change in the form of more computer related investment. Scheve and Slaughter () find that FDI is the key aspect of globalization that raises the elasticity of labor demand. In a study of outward FDI by U.K. firms, they find that higher FDI is associated with higher elasticity of labor demand and greater volatility of wages and employment
G. Threat of Job Loss and Wage Suppression
A less easily quantifiable channel through which globalization and especially offshoring influence wages and job security is the threat by companies to move production overseas. The following is how Freeman (, p. ) describes the phenomenon:
It isnt even necessary that the West import the toys. The threat to import them or to move plants to less-developed countries to produce toys may suffice to force low-skilled westerners to take a cut in pay to maintain employment. In this situation, the open economy can cause lower pay for low-skilled westerners even without trade.
The issue has received considerable attention from theorists, but there is little empirical analy-
sis. Bronfenbrenner (, ), studying the U.S. between  and , focuses more narrowly on unionization campaigns than on wages. She finds that a firms mobility did raise the credibility of the threat to move production offshore, and it influenced the decision of workers regarding unionization .The study indicates that unionization drives have a much lower rate of success in firms with a credible threat of mobility than in those considered immobile. Similarly, Choi () looked at detailed outward foreign direct investment by U.S. manufacturers and found that increased outward FDI was associated with lower wage premiums for union members during the period -.
. Conclusion and Prospects for the Future
This paper has shown that the new wave of globalization has raised worker vulnerability in industrialized countries by increasing the likelihood of getting unemployed, reducing employment and wage growth, lowering the overall labor share of national income, and raising inequality between highand low-skilled workers. But vulnerability does not translate directly into economic insecurity. This depends on households capacity to cope with the risk of sudden loss of employment and income and on national policies to absorb such risks. The decline in household saving and massive growth in household debt reflect in part the dwindling ability of households to cope with employment and income shocks.
 See Burke and Epstein () for an overview and Rodrik () for a game-theoretic approach.
  
Different industrialized countries have implemented very different sets of policies to cope with the situation arising from the new wave of globalization, and we have identified five models. At one extreme is the Anglo-Saxon model represented by the U.S. and other Anglo-Saxon economies with lax hiring and firing regulations, low unemployment benefits, and very limited spending on active labor market policies. At the other extreme is the Rhineland model, represented by France and Germany, who have relatively high levels of employment protection, large unemployment benefits, and significant spending on active labor market programs. Denmark and a few other countries seem to have combined elements the two, devising a model of flexicurity, characterized by labor market flexibility, high replacement income programs for the unemployed, and extensive active labor market programs. In recent years, France and Germany seem to be moving toward the flexicurity model, but are still far from reaching the Danish practice of this model.
The analysis of offshoring presented in this paper indicates that flexicurity, as a way of managing state-market relations in a globalized economy, is probably not sufficient for ensuring economic security in the long run. What is instead required is re-channeling of the gains from offshoring away from finance and towards re-investment in the domestic economy. Tighter labor markets driven not by unsustainable consumer debt but by productivity-enhancing private investment is the long-term key to sharing the gains from globalization.
This conclusion raises a question about the relationship between national policy and international competitiveness. It is often heard that greater state-provided social protection constitutes a cost to producers that reduces international competitiveness. The evidence, however, indicates that the opposite may be true. The provision of greater social protection does not unambiguously reduce a countrys export competitiveness and in some cases may even increase it. In a study of OECD countries over the period -, Milberg and Houston () find that there are multiple paths to export competitiveness for industrialized countries. On the one hand there is the high-road relying on innovation, high productivity, and high levels of compensation and job security resulting from labor-management cooperation and state support for economic security. On the other hand is the low road, in which productivity growth hinges on intense conflict between labor and management rooted in job insecurity and a weak role for the state in guaranteeing social protection. This conclusion also applies to the six countries studied in this paper. Denmark and Germany, two countries with greater state intervention in sharing the burden of insecurity, have increased their trade surpluses considerably over the past  years, while the Anglo-Saxon countries have experienced massive trade deficit.
Over the past  years, the new wave of globalization has led to a rise in the share of profits in the national income and decline in the share of wages, increasing inequality in the society. Unless reversed, this tendency toward polarization is likely to get stronger as globalization gradually engulfs more sections of the labor force, including high-skilled and service sector workers, and thus spreads insecurity to wider sections of the population.
In industrialized democracies such polarization and widespread insecurity may call into question the very merit of liberal trade policies and the efficacy of the traditional (Anglo-Saxon and Rhineland) arrangements between states and markets. The response may take a variety of forms, including a dangerous protectionist backlash. It is therefore urgent to formulate policies and erect an institutional structure that can address effectively the challenges raised by the new wave of globalization.
