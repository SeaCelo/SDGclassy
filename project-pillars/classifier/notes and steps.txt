Steps and notesTraining data:Purpose is to create individual training files for each of the “pillars” based on the SG report on the work of the organization (e.g., A/RES/74/1)Steps:1. Ignore the introduction2. Start on Chapter II and copy/paste each relevant section into each file, one of each of the pillars3. Note that older reports will have different structures and headings. This will require subjective decisions on a case by case basis4. Current structure follows A74 chapter II structure:a. Growth and developmentb. Peace and securityc. Development of Africad. Human rightse. Humanitarian assistancef. Justice and lawg. Disarmamenth. Drugs crime terrorismA67 – A74 use same structure. Start using this collection as training dataset. If needed, do a mapping exercise from previous formats. But this adds complexity, so test without it for now. This is also better to keep model based on more recent language.Ensure that file encodings are utf-8. In Terminal.app 
   -navigate to directory   
      textutil -convert txt -encoding UTF-8 *.txt    <<<note the need to be in the right pathTraining the classifier
