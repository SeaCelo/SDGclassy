Executive Summary 
In 2015, the United Kingdom (UK) played a central role in the formulation and adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (the “Goals” also known as the Global Goals). The UK pushed hard for commitments on gender equality, peace and security, and the underpinning promise to Leave No One Behind – all of which remain UK priorities.
The UK is committed to implementing the Goals and the 2030 Agenda at home and around the world. While progress has been made, much remains to  be done.
Implementing the Goals
In the UK, national frameworks capture government priorities in relation to the Goals, with work taking place on multiple levels to strengthen delivery across the UK. This approach recognises and respects the devolution settlements in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Each is responsible for implementing its own policies in areas of devolved competence, resulting in approaches that respond to national and local needs.
UK data for the Global Indicators is reported to the United Nations (UN) by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the UK’s national statistics agency. 
This data is open, transparent and accessible via the ONS’ National Reporting Platform. The Platform sets out the Global Indicators for which data is available, the source, disaggregation where available, and any other relevant information.
Action on the Goals 
The UK’s first Voluntary National Review sets out clearly and comprehensively collective efforts on the Goals since their adoption in 2015. It covers domestic and international work on all 17 Goals, with a focus on the domestic. It has been produced through collaboration with and input from the devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
It not only tells the story of government but demonstrates the breadth of action and activity across the UK as a whole. This has been informed by wide-ranging stakeholder engagement. There are activity snapshots throughout the report. These, and the narrative in each chapter, highlight how much delivering sustainable development depends on engagement beyond government, particularly by civil society and the private sector.
Each Goal-focussed chapter provides coverage of the Goals at Global Target level. It takes stock of progress, highlights achievements, outlines challenges and identifies next steps. 
The UK is determined to tackle injustices at home and abroad. The Goals reflect the most significant global challenges of modern time. The issues they relate to are complex and interlinked. The Voluntary National Review shows some of the action being taken. This is a work in progress and there is more to do to meet the ambition of the Goals. 
The ONS has been able to source good data on most of the Goals – reporting data on 74% (180 of the total 244) of Global Indicators as of June 2019. The transparency and strength of the Voluntary National Review depends in part on this data. But gaps remain, particularly concerning the extent to which data can currently be disaggregated, which can make it difficult to identify those most at risk of being left behind. The ONS is continuing to work hard on this.
Notwithstanding this challenge, the UK has a strong story to tell domestically on many of the Goals, including:
• high-quality health service, free for all at the point of use;
• high and rising standards of education, including putting inclusivity at the heart of education policy, supporting the full potential of learners of all ages;
• increasing employment, with more women and those with disabilities in work;
• progress made on climate and the environment; and
• some of the world’s strongest legislation on equality issues, in order to advance equality of opportunity for all.
• At the same time, there are areas that require further work on each of the Goals, including: 
• continuing to tackle injustice to ensure no one is left behind;
• further increasing efforts to address climate and environmental issues;
• ensuring the housing market works for everybody;
• responding to mental health needs; and 
• supporting a growing and ageing population.
Internationally, the UK remains committed to spending 
0.7% of gross national income (GNI) on Official Development Assistance (ODA) to support delivery  of the Goals, in accordance with the UK Aid Strategy.  In line with the promise to Leave No One Behind, the UK also continues to meet the UN target (as part of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda agreement) to allocate between 0.15-0.2% of GNI to ODA in Least Developed Countries.
For example, the UK is strengthening global health security by helping tackle diseases including Ebola. Moreover, there is concerted effort to help the world’s poorest by tackling global challenges like pollution and climate change; addressing the root causes of extreme poverty by tackling conflict and building peace and security; and contributing to inclusive and sustainable economic growth.
Conclusion and next steps
Each chapter sets out conclusions and next steps. The success of this Voluntary National Review will partly depend on how far it galvanises further collective action to deliver the Goals. The UK presents the Voluntary National Review with a mixture of pride in what it has achieved so far, but also humility, given the scale of the challenges that lie ahead. The UK will continue striving in all areas to achieve success and it hopes that the lessons and experience distilled in this report will help others in the common effort to deliver one of the most ambitious commitments the world has ever undertaken. 

Approach to the Voluntary National Review 

As part of the process for reviewing and monitoring progress towards the Goals, all UN Member States are expected to carry out a national review of progress towards the Goals at least once in the period to 2030. This process is called a Voluntary National Review, leading to a report that is then presented to the annual UN High-Level Political Forum. This is the UK’s first Voluntary National Review. 
Taking an inclusive approach from the outset, the UK’s Voluntary National Review is the product of collaboration between the UK government, devolved administrations, civil society, business and the private sector, and local delivery partners. As a result of this approach, a diverse range of voices and accounts from across the UK are reflected throughout the report.
Principles 
The UK committed to delivering a Voluntary National Review that:
• highlights in a clear and accessible way the ‘wholeof-UK’ contribution to delivering all 17 Goals;
• is underpinned by data; and
• illustrates both the UK’s domestic and  international activity.
Co-ordination and Input
With overall leadership and policy oversight of the 
2030 Agenda and the Goals, the UK Government’s Department for International Development (DFID) led co-ordination of the Voluntary National Review working closely with the other parts of UK government including the Cabinet Office; the devolved administrations; and the Office for National Statistics (ONS) – the UK’s national statistical agency. An inter-departmental group across UK government on the Goals, co-chaired by officials in DFID and the Cabinet Office, provided governance for the overall process in the UK. Representatives from the ONS also attended meetings to ensure data remained a central feature.
Contributions from UK government were overseen by individuals acting as ‘Goal Champions’ within each relevant UK government department. In addition, lead departments were identified for the overall development of each Goal-focussed chapter, along with ‘Senior Responsible Owners’ for the duration of the production of this Voluntary National Review.
Data and monitoring
Information and data were collected from a range of sources, including:
a. The ONS’ National Reporting Platform, an online tool capturing UK data on the UN’s Global Indicators. As the Global Indicators were produced for both developing and developed countries, these do not comprehensively cover all areas that are relevant to the UK. 
b. Other government sources to fill in the gaps between UK data and the Global Indicators, to help provide a fuller picture of UK progress towards the Goals. 
c. Non-government sources to provide further objectivity and context. 
d. Single Departmental Plans – which provide a 
framework to focus the UK government’s efforts on important issues, and through which individual 
UK government departments have embedded the Goals; and
e. Government Annual Reports and Accounts 
which review activities undertaken by each UK government department over the course of the year.
Interlinkages 
From delivering economic growth and jobs to investing in girls and women and tackling inequality, the 17 Goals represent a framework for addressing the cross-cutting challenges facing the UK and the world today. The interlinkages between the Goals mean that progress in one area, such as education or gender equality, will have a direct or indirect impact on others, such as poverty, justice and decent work. 
By recognising interlinkages, government, business and civil society can collaborate to develop holistic long-term solutions that benefit multiple groups of people and contribute to several Goals at once. 
A selection of the interlinkages between the Goals within the UK context are identified in the Goalfocussed chapters. 
Stakeholder engagement and partnerships
Learning from other UN Member States about their Voluntary National Review preparations, the UK adopted a comprehensive approach to stakeholder engagement to reflect best practice and ensure inclusivity. Starting in 2018, and with frequent liaison with the key umbrella organisations to inform the approach, a range of engagement activities were undertaken, designed to capture as many views as possible. There were a number of distinct and often concurrent phases of engagement. In total more than 380 organisations were engaged through: 
a. Inviting case studies from organisations and individuals from across the UK. These illustrate the depth and breadth of activity contributing to the delivery of the Goals at home and around the world. Over 270 case studies were received by June 2019 from a wide range of groups, including organisations that are not within the remit of government.  
b. A programme of outreach to raise awareness of the Voluntary National Review and the opportunities to participate, primarily in the period July 2018 – April 2019. DFID officials spoke at events across the UK, including an event in Glasgow on 16 October 2018 alongside the Scottish Government, and on 15 January 2019 in Cardiff with the Welsh Government. A detailed list of past engagement activity is on the UK’s Voluntary National Review website.
c. Goal-focussed engagement events and 
activities undertaken by lead UK government departments for the purposes of the Voluntary National Review starting in November 2018. These were designed and delivered through a variety of formats, reflecting the diversity in approaches towards key stakeholder groups. 
d. Sector-specific engagement events supported by the Emerging Findings and Further Engagement (EFFE) document. Between 1120 March 2019, using the EFFE document as a prompt for discussions, DFID ran a series of events with Parliamentarians, international development organisations, civil society, local delivery organisations, private sector and faith groups, 
as well as regional events in Leeds and Bristol 
focussing on local delivery organisations. An online questionnaire was also available to supplement these events inviting comments on the themes and key questions in the EFFE document. The events revealed widespread enthusiasm for the Goals within a range of sectors, and real appreciation for the opportunity to inform the Voluntary National Review. More detail on key themes that arose from this engagement can be found on the UK’s Voluntary National Review website.
Devolved administrations
In Scotland, many groups with an interest in sustainability and development have been engaging with national and local government to explore ways of working and to undertake projects, programmes and initiatives. The SDG Network Scotland, an open coalition bringing together the voices of over 300 people and organisations across Scotland, was formed by the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations (SCVO) in 2017 to assist with the development of a Scotland-wide response to the Goals challenge.  
The Scottish Government has worked with the 
Network and the Convention of Scottish Local 
Authorities (COSLA) to produce material for the UK’s Voluntary National Review and full detail can be found in the Scottish Supplementary Review.  Further detail on the Supplementary Review, and the process, policies and principals for this work are available at www.nationalperformance.gov.scot/.
Wales’s approach to the Voluntary National Review built on ongoing action by the Welsh Government, the Future Generations Commissioner for Wales, the Sustainable Development Alliance and others to deliver the seven well-being goals for Wales, which translate the Goals into what matters for Wales. In January 2019, the Welsh Government with the Future Generations Commissioner for Wales held two stakeholder summits in Cardiff and Llandudno bringing people from the public and private sector, higher and further education, and civil society together to see how to intensify efforts for sustainable development and the Goals, and how Wales is contributing to the 2030 Agenda with its own  well-being goals. The Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 has built in mechanisms for review, which include the role played by the independent Future Generations Commissioner for Wales and the Auditor General for Wales. The National Assembly for Wales has also taken an interest in how the Welsh Government and others are delivering Wales’s sustainable development agenda. To guide Wales’s input into the UK’s Voluntary National Review, a ‘Wales and the Goals’ working group was established, which also helped prepare a Welsh Supplementary Report. A copy of the report can be found here www.gov.wales.
All Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS) departments take responsibility for meeting commitments to the delivery of the draft Programme for Government (PfG) and the Goals. Appropriate actions are taken either by individual departments, or, where a better outcome can be achieved, through departments working in collaboration. 
As lead for providing Northern Ireland input to the 
UK’s Voluntary National Review, the Department of 
Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) Climate Change Unit worked closely with NICS departments and other public bodies in Northern Ireland to meet the UK’s reporting obligations.

Incorporating the Goals in policy and planning frameworks

Across the UK
The UK’s approach to Goal delivery reflects its unique constitutional arrangements. 
Since 1999, devolution has transformed the way the UK is run. The UK Parliament legislates for England as well as on reserved issues that cover the whole of the UK. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland each have their own legislature and government and are responsible for implementing policy in areas of devolved competence. Below is a high-level summary of some of the policy areas that are broadly devolved and reserved in each part of the UK. Each devolution settlement is unique and the distinction between devolved and reserved powers can sometimes be complex. 
Issues reserved to

The wider UK family also includes 3 Crown 
Dependencies and 14 Overseas Territories. The 
Crown Dependencies consist of the Isle of Man, the Bailiwick of Jersey and the Bailiwick of Guernsey. The Crown Dependencies are not part of the UK but are self-governing dependencies of the Crown. This means they have their own directly elected legislative assemblies, administrative, fiscal and legal systems and their own courts of law. Overseas Territories, such as Gibraltar and the Falkland Islands, fall under the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the UK. The majority are self-governing, with the UK retaining responsibility for defence and foreign policy. 
Single Departmental Plans in the UK
Following the UK’s key role in the 2015 negotiations of the 2030 Agenda and the Goals, the UK government published Agenda 2030: Delivering the Global Goals (2017) to provide more detail on UK government activity to support Goal delivery both domestically and internationally. 
All of the Goals are now reflected throughout the UK government’s programme of work collectively delivering activity on social, economic, and environmental issues. Each UK government department has embedded the Goals in its Single Departmental Plan – an established process to focus government efforts on important issues. Each department’s Single Departmental Plan outlines how planned activity will support the delivery of the Goals. These plans are published annually. Each department also works with its partners and stakeholders to deliver these priorities. The progress of activity that supports the Goals is reported publicly in 

Departmental Annual Reports and Accounts, enabling scrutiny by Parliament and the public.
The Secretary of State for International Development has overall leadership and policy oversight for the Goals, with the Minister for Implementation in Cabinet Office playing an important role in ensuring a coordinated cross-government approach to the delivery of the Goals. Officials in the UK government’s Department for International Development (DFID) and the Cabinet Office co-chair a cross-government group, which meets regularly and provides a platform to coordinate Goal implementation, integrate the Goals into departmental activity, and consider progress towards their implementation. This group also oversaw preparations for the Voluntary National Review. 
The National Performance Framework in Scotland
Scotland’s National Performance Framework (NPF) is the main mechanism for localising and implementing the Goals in Scotland. The NPF and the Goals share the same aims: encouraging transformational social, economic and environmental change to achieve increased well-being and a more peaceful and prosperous future. The NPF is underpinned by law and is intended to inform discussion, collaboration and planning of policies and services across Scotland – encompassing public sector, businesses, civil society and communities. It provides a national purpose to create a more successful country with opportunities for all to flourish through increased well-being and sustainable and inclusive economic growth. It highlights the broad National Outcomes that support the purpose and provides measures for progress. The NPF is also underpinned by values to guide Scotland as a society which treats all people with kindness, dignity and respect, respects the rule of law and acts in an open and transparent way. The NPF provides a focus on tackling inequalities so that no one in Scotland is left behind. As natural allies the NPF embeds the Goals through mapping to the National Outcomes. In Scotland the effort is amplified by the SDG Network Scotland, an open coalition bringing together the voices of over 300 people and organisations.
The Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 in Wales
Wales has a long history of taking action to advance sustainable development. In 1998 Wales  was one of the first nations to put sustainable development into its founding legislation. In the lead up to the agreement of the Goals, Wales carried out a national conversation on ‘The Wales We Want’ to inform its ambitions for sustainable development. Since 2015 Wales’s efforts have been shaped by the groundbreaking Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 which puts sustainable development on a significantly stronger footing in the legislative and policy landscape in Wales. 

The Act enshrines Wales’s commitment to sustainable development and seeks to strengthen efforts to tackle key intergenerational challenges, such as climate change, poverty and inequalities. The Act localises the 17 Goals into domestic legislation through Wales’s own 7 sustainable development goals (wellbeing goals), a legally binding common purpose to work towards the 7 well-being goals, the inclusion of a culture as a fourth dimension of sustainable development, and the establishment of statutory partnerships to advance sustainable development. It places a duty on public bodies in order for sustainable development to be the central organising principle of government and specified public bodies in Wales. The Act also establishes the world’s first statutory independent Future Generations Commissioner for Wales to be the guardian of future generations in 
Wales and support the transformation needed. The Auditor General for Wales also has obligations to examine this change. At a local level, partnerships have been formed to plan and deliver long term change across communities in Wales through Public Services Boards.
Using legislation to drive positive action is Wales’s blueprint for localising the Goals, and whilst most of the initial efforts have been focussed on those public bodies subject to the Act, civil society, businesses and the wider public sector are playing a key role in implementing Agenda 2030. 
The draft Programme for Government in Northern Ireland
Northern Ireland has incorporated the three dimensions of sustainable development; economic, social and environmental, into the Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS) strategic plans, rather than through separate sustainability strategies. This has resulted in the principles of sustainable development being embedded in the Northern Ireland Executive’s highest- level strategy, the draft Programme for Government (PfG). The approach to sustainable development and the UK Voluntary National Review in Northern Ireland has therefore been through the draft Programme for Government.
Around the world
The UK’s development expertise and commitment to spending 0.7% of gross national income (GNI) on Official Development Assistance (ODA) means it is one of the leading international contributors to the Goals. The UK Aid Strategy (2015) sets out how the UK uses its development and diplomatic leadership to address some of the most pressing issues that the world faces, including the fight against disease, the empowerment of women and supporting a reduction in global carbon emissions – by putting international development at the heart of UK national security and foreign policy. 
Under the UK’s devolution settlement, international relations remain the responsibility of the UK government.1 However, the devolved administrations can choose to allocate funds to development programmes that contribute to overall UK ODA spend. 
Scotland places great importance on being a good global citizen. This means playing a part in tackling global challenges including poverty, injustice and inequality. In 2016, following a public consultation, the Scottish Government published Global Citizenship: Scotland’s International Development Strategy, which sets out Scotland’s contribution to the international community and is specifically designed to align with the Goals. The Strategy is focussed on four partner countries: Malawi, Rwanda, Zambia and Pakistan; and has an International Development Fund to support and empower those four partner countries.
Wales has, through its Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015, set a well-being goal for ‘a globally responsible Wales.’ This is described in law as ‘a nation which, when doing anything to improve the economic, social, environmental and cultural well-being of Wales, takes account of whether doing such a thing may make a positive contribution to global well-being.’ Ways of measuring this goal include National Indicator 14 ‘The Ecological Footprint of Wales’. Work to deliver this goal includes the Wales for Africa Grant Scheme, a flagship initiative enabling community groups and organisations in Wales to access funding for smallscale projects that contribute to Wales’s delivery of the Goals and deliver benefits to Wales and Africa.

Delivering the Goals through shared endeavourThe 2030 Agenda is not just for and about government initiatives; it involves many stakeholders including the private sector, civil society, local communities and individuals. For example, the UK Parliament has carried out a number of inquiries on the Goals and their delivery, including the International Development Committee, the Environmental Audit Committee, and the Women and Equalities Committee. The All-Party Parliamentary Group on the United Nations Global Goals for 
Sustainable Development (APPG) also brings together Members of Parliament to discuss and promote the Goals.
Many sectors are  making substantial efforts to raise awareness, form partnerships and use opportunities in the UK and globally to deliver the Goals, going beyond “business as usual” to make a real impact. Through partnerships and as guided by the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, both public and private funding will be necessary to achieve the Goals. 
This chapter explores in further detail the roles of three UK sectors whose work contributes to delivering the Goals. It is intended to provide examples of nongovernment activity from across the UK, rather than being an exhaustive list. 
Civil Society 
Civil society is at the heart of the UK’s communities. A healthy, independent and influential civil society is a hallmark of a thriving democracy and key to leaving no one behind. The UK’s civil society is highly respected internationally and is looked to as a model for creating an enabling environment for civil society to thrive.
Through the UN’s Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), civil society organisations played an active role in shaping the Goals, and they continue to play an even more critical role in communicating and implementing them.
How is UK civil society contributing to the Goals? 
UK civil society contributes in a number of ways including: 
• direct implementation, through their programmes and services; 
• raising awareness, both at home and overseas, through campaigns and community engagement; 
• reviewing progress toward achieving the Goals and holding government to account; and
• working collaboratively with other sectors to achieve the Goals. 
Civil society is central to tackling big societal challenges and thus achieving the Goals. In 2018, the UK government published the Civil Society Strategy (2018). The Strategy set out a bold new vision for how government will work with and support civil society in the long term. The Strategy is encouraging people, organisations and businesses to help make a difference; it is the beginning of an ambitious, evolving programme to help build a strong society and future for the UK that works for everyone. 
The UK’s civil society organisations also do extraordinary work around the world to support delivery of the Goals, in some of the most challenging settings. From delivering life-saving assistance when disaster strikes, to addressing the underlying causes of deprivation, they have led the way in innovating and in challenging existing ways of working in development in order to strengthen efforts to end extreme poverty, reach the most marginalised, and deliver on the 2030 Agenda. In early 2019, the UK government confirmed new funding to make it easier for small charities and humanitarian organisations to access the UK aid budget and support delivery of the Goals.
Examples of good practice 
In the UK, civil society coalitions such as the UK Stakeholders for Sustainable Development (UKSSD) and Bond international development network play an important role in driving domestic and international implementation of the Goals and sustainable development more broadly. For example, the UKSSD network, which includes over 1,000 partners from a range of sectors, works to ‘inspire, influence and inform people, communities and organisations to transform the UK into a truly sustainable society’. Many individual civil society organisations across the UK are also working to raise awareness of the Goals in their local communities.
Volunteers are making a critical contribution to the delivery of the Goals and there is growing recognition of the importance of volunteering for development outcomes, including the Goals. Official estimates indicate that volunteering contributes 2.4% to global gross domestic product (GDP), and the United Nations Volunteer programme estimated in 2018 that across the world one billion people are giving up their time to volunteer.3 In the UK, there is emerging evidence of the contribution that volunteers are making to deliver the Goals. For example, research by the Kings Fund in 2013 highlighted the contribution of the 3 million volunteers who support health and social care organisations, including 78,000 volunteers in acute hospitals across England, who together contribute more than 13 million hours a year.4
Volunteering can play an important role in helping to further strengthen people’s ownership of the Goals and contributes, in different ways, to achieving the Goals. The UK government’s vision, as articulated in the Civil Society Strategy (2018), is for people from all backgrounds and of all ages to be able to thrive, connect with each other, and give back to their communities – building an integrated society that works for everyone, in which people have a sense of control over their future and that of their community.
The UK remains at or near the top of the global league tables for philanthropy and volunteering, with people in the UK giving more to charitable causes than any other country in Europe5, and the majority of the population volunteering, in some way, over the course of a year. In 2017-18, 64% of people in England took part in a volunteering activity at least once.6 Volunteers are also making a significant contribution to the UK’s international development programmes overseas, for example, through the UK aid-funded International Citizen Service programme. Business and the private sector
The UK business community has long been considered a leader in ethical and responsible business practice. Now, under the banner of the Goals, UK business has both the opportunity and obligation to make an even more profound commitment to wider society.
The UK’s Industrial Strategy (2019) prioritises longterm business growth as central to national prosperity, and the Civil Society Strategy (2018) sets out a vision for supporting responsible business as a force for good in UK society. Responsible businesses are essential to building a stronger society that works for everyone and, as outlined in the Civil Society Strategy, the UK’s leading businesses increasingly put social and environmental responsibility at the heart of what they do.
Why should business contribute to the Goals? 
Evidence continues to mount that commitment from business is not just good for society, it is good for business. Across key stakeholder groups, expectations are rising that businesses should clearly demonstrate their contribution to sustainable development. For example, in the UK 62% of prospective employees have a strong expectation that their employer will have a “greater purpose”, and their job “a meaningful societal impact”7, and 79% of the public agree that “CEOs should take the lead on change rather than waiting for government to impose it”.8 Businesses whose core activities contribute to sustainable development not only realise their stakeholders’ expectations, but future-proof their business and enhance their long-term commercial performance as well. For example, 70% of turnover growth at Unilever last year was driven by its sustainable brands; this was the fourth consecutive year that they had out-performed average growth.9 For businesses, the Goals offer value in two key ways.
• As a strategic framework to help the business future-proof against the risks of not meeting the Goals and pursue the business opportunities that achieving them will unlock. 
• As a universally recognised brand to clearly signal their commitment to sustainable development to stakeholders.
Technology offers unprecedented opportunities to rethink the way in which the Goals are tackled. The UK’s technology sector has the potential to play a leading role in this. London is the acknowledged centre of Europe’s tech sector, producing one in five of the continent’s fast-growing technology unicorns  with a value of £118 billion (US$148 billion), and from 2013 to 2018, the UK received £28 billion (US$35 billion) of venture capital investment in tech.10 This extraordinary acceleration of the UK’s tech sector has happened for many reasons. The UK has four of the world’s top 10 universities and produces more than 5,000 Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)  PhDs each year. World-class expertise in Artificial Intelligence and deep tech, as well as advanced robotics, advanced manufacturing and automotive experts are contributing to responsible, sustainable growth. 
Activity snapshot: 
Business in the Community (BITC) works to inspire and engage businesses to become more responsible and tackle some of society’s biggest issues. In 2018, BITC created the Responsible Business Map and Tracker based on the Goals to support business to identify and improve on the key issues that businesses need to address to achieve long-term financial value, enabling both society and the planet to thrive. In partnership with Deloitte and supported by Arm and the Global Goals Leadership Team, BITC also launched the ‘Towards the Tipping Point: Global Goals Guide for Business’ report to identify practical ways businesses can engage with the Goals.
Achieving the Goals has a clear business rationale. The 
Business and Sustainable Development Commission (BSDC) estimates that globally in four economic sectors alone (food and agriculture, cities, energy and materials, and health and well-being), achieving the Goals has the potential to open up US$12 trillion of market opportunities, in turn creating up to 380 million jobs a year by 2030.11
How is UK business contributing to the Goals? 
In mid-2018, the UK Government commissioned Deloitte to assess the current level of UK business engagement with the Goals. Engagement with the Goals was defined as the degree to which businesses integrate a commitment to sustainable development into their core activities, and the degree to which they use the Goals to do so.12
Through this study, Deloitte characterised four engagement archetypes:13
• Not engaged: Business activity is not linked to sustainable development 
• Explorers: Some business activity is linked to sustainable development or the Goals
• Fellow travellers: Sustainable development is core to the business model, but Goals are not referenced or deployed
• Champions: Sustainable development is core to the business model, and linked to the Goals
They then assessed a sample of UK businesses and providers of capital to map the current landscape (see diagram on page 16). The study showed that 
UK public businesses are the most engaged with the Goals, with the majority making a public commitment to the Goals agenda and over half beginning to align their business activity to the Goals. Few private businesses championed the Goals, although many were highly engaged with sustainable development. However, over half were beginning to explore how they could contribute to both the Goals and sustainable development.
Small- and medium-sized-enterprises (SMEs) evaluated had extremely low levels of Goal awareness, despite 22% of SMEs serving a social mission and the growth in new business models such as Certified B Corporations that align to a common shared purpose.14 Those businesses that were engaging noted that the Goals brought value to conversations with partners and clients. Investors were highly engaged with sustainable development, often using environmental and social indicators to support responsible investment decisions. 
The UK Government is currently leading research to better understand how people want their savings, pensions and investments to be invested and what opportunities for responsible investment they would like to see.
Engagement is also evidenced through reporting initiatives, such as Shift’s UN Guiding Principles Reporting Framework, designed to increase reporting and investor interest in human rights. Similarly to public businesses, just under half of investors used the Goals to signal their commitment to stakeholders. They also used the Goals as a thematic guide to channel impact investments and support long-term investment decision making. While they did not measure impact directly against the Goals, 22% of investors linked their existing reporting frameworks to the Goals. Investors most highly engaged with the Goals were large institutional investors, national Development Finance Institutions and smaller funds specialising in sustainable investing.
Examples of good practice:
Where businesses do engage with the Goals as a tool to deliver impact, they deploy them as a:
• signal of their commitment to sustainable development;
• thematic framework to enable strategic choice, collaboration or innovation;
• tool to support non-financial reporting; and
• framework for direct financing e.g. for climate resilience, or by investing in businesses and projects that are providing solutions to one or more of the Goals. It is estimated that there is a US$2.5 trillion annual investment gap to achieve the Goals in the developing world, and injections of private sector funding will be essential in narrowing this gap. 
There are also a range of resources already available to help businesses begin to engage more deeply, including the UN Global Compact Network UK’s Sustainable Development Goal Roadshow aimed at stimulating Goal-related business action and partnerships across the UK. Some businesses are increasingly using tools to measure their impact, for example the World Benchmarking Alliance, comparing corporate performance against the Goals.
Local delivery 
The UK’s cities, local authorities and local partners play a key role in supporting delivery of the Goals in the UK, while helping to ensure no-one, and no community, is left behind. It is estimated that 65% of the 169 Global Targets need local stakeholders to be involved if they are to be achieved.15 There are great examples of local communities taking responsibility for sustainable development and reaching out to help others do so too.
How are local actors contributing to the Goals? 
Local authorities are often responsible for many of the services and environments people interact with daily. From providing social care (Goal 3) to safe education (Goal 4) to effective transport planning (Goal 11), local authorities are vital to the domestic delivery of the Goals. In return, the Goals offer an effective framework to support local authorities with developing plans, strategies and supporting overall progress on sustainable development. 
Local authorities are well placed to provide the vital link between local communities and businesses and the Goals by connecting local priorities with the Goals and raising awareness of their importance amongst stakeholders. They can also reflect the needs and unique circumstances of their residents and communities to ensure resources are directed in the most effective ways.

The Welsh Local Government Association represents the interests of local government and promotes local democracy in Wales. Local Authorities were one of the early adopters for the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 and have produced a range of targeted resources to help councils adapt to a new way of doing business.
Using their position as a bridge between national government, civil society, businesses and citizens, local authorities can convene and support networks of domestic and international partners. This can amplify their efforts significantly and ensure best practice is shared with partners around the world.

The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA) is the national association of Scottish councils and is the voice of local government in Scotland. It has been engaged with the agenda prior to and since the Goals were approved in 2015. As well as agreeing a common strategic approach for the Goals, COSLA has worked with the Scottish Government on the meaningful localisation of the Goals by councils and communities and ran a summit on localising the Goals in early 2019.
Cities have the potential to make great strides in support of the Goals through the promotion of sustainable consumption, environmental sustainability and social inclusion. For example, the London Sustainable Development Commission provides independent advice to the Mayor of London on sustainable development. Other cities in the UK are being used as hubs to coordinate action and encourage cross-sector engagement.

The 2030hub in Liverpool was set up to help support the UN’s Local2030 initiative. It aims to raise awareness of the Goals and the value they can add, facilitate innovation and bring together domestic and international actors to deliver against the Goals.
Activity snapshot: 
Following Bristol’s role as European Green Capital in 2015, a number of local stakeholders, keen to build on the city-wide momentum, organised workshops which led to the creation of the Bristol SDG Alliance in 2016. The Alliance now consists of more than 110 stakeholders, including Bristol Council officials, who advocate for the uses of the Goals. The work of the Alliance resulted in the integration of the Goals into Bristol’s strategic planning processes and the production of the UK’s first City-level review of Goals progress (or Voluntary Local Review) which will be launched at the UN High-Level Political Forum in July.

In Scotland, Dundee City Council is undertaking three key actions under each of the Goals. To implement Goal 11 the Council intends to; build 1,000 new affordable homes; develop the city’s electric vehicle charging infrastructure and the Council’s own fleet of electric vehicles and; improve neighbourhood bus services, develop a financially sustainable model of accessible transport and implement a range of ‘active travel’ projects.
Activity snapshot: 
Led by International Service, the Bring the Global Goals to York project aimed to embed the Goals locally, conducting rapid assessment of city strategies and plans and their alignment with the Goals, analysing the results and recommending ways to strengthen Goal delivery at a local level. The project increased understanding of the Goals amongst city stakeholders and their relevance to the UK and specifically at a city level. This was demonstrated through the inclusion of the Goals in all new strategies and plans, through the lens of the city’s One Planet York framework.
Community, neighbourhood, parish and town councils across the UK can also engage with citizens at a micro-level and develop a grassroots approach to sustainable development. Their work helps to improve the quality of life of local populations and environments while their strong links to communities are essential for the Leave No One Behind agenda.

Carmarthenshire County Council and Dolen 
Cymru Lesotho are partners in the Walk the 
Global Walk project, led by Oxfam Italia and Regione Toscana, to deliver training and resources to schools on specific Goals. The project promotes dialogue, participation and youth leadership and in its first year has been taken up by seven secondary schools and one primary school in Carmarthenshire.
The Royal Society of Arts (RSA) has brought together a group of its local members to act as honorary consultants to Thame Town Council. They have been working to develop a Green Living Plan for the market town of Thame and surrounding areas. In doing so they have consulted widely with local residents and business to take this forward and have produced a Green Living Plan template to help other communities accelerate their own sustainability ambitions.
Next steps
Within all three sectors, awareness of the Goals is varied. Whilst momentum is building across the UK, with more and more partners recognising the economic and societal value of a commitment to the Goals, further work is needed.
There are a range of opportunities for all sectors to further increase their support for and delivery of Goals. In addition, more could be done to better engage civil society, businesses and local partners to increase awareness of the Goals and the opportunities they present both in the UK and globally; and to provide support and continued advice on how sectors can deeply and practically contribute to delivery of the Goals.

Using Data and tracking progress towards the Goals

The UK played an integral role in the negotiation of the Goals’ indicator framework, with the UK National Statistician chairing the UN Statistical Commission in 2015/16. The UK is one of a few countries to report data on more than 70% of the Global Indicators. The UK is also collaborating with other countries to develop statistical capacity and share expertise, and to help others measure progress towards the Goals. Across networks of statisticians, researchers, analysts and data scientists, the UK is committed to finding innovative solutions to the measurement challenges all countries face in monitoring progress on this ambitious agenda.
The importance of data 
“All of the core activities of government involve data, including making decisions on individual cases; tracking the outcomes of policies; and deciding on the need for new policies.
“And these data serve a wider public purpose too: helping a huge range of people (citizens, parliamentarians, media, businesses, voluntary organisations) make sense of the world and make important decisions in their work and their life.” Source: UK Code of Practice for Statistics
Good quality, timely and comprehensive data show what is happening in society, the economy and the environment all around the world. For the first time, under the 2030 Agenda, developed and developing countries are working toward the same Global Targets and Indicators. Unless otherwise specified, this chapter uses ‘indicator’ to mean ‘Global Indicator’. 
With pioneering data innovations and diverse collection methods, the UK has one of the world’s largest and most developed data systems. 
Key Figures: 
• The 2030 Agenda comprises 17 Goals, 169 Global Targets and 244 Global Indicators. 
• As of June 2019, UK data are reported on 180 (74%) of the 244 Global Indicators, one of the highest proportions in the world.
• UK data are reported for all of the Global Indicators that underpin three of the Goals (Goal 5, Goal 7 and Goal 13).
• Over 70% of the 180 reported Global Indicators have data for at least one disaggregation such as sex, age, or geographic location.
• UK data are reported on 83% of those indicators classified as Tier 1 by the UN (“indicator is conceptually clear, has an internationally established methodology and standards, and data are regularly produced…”).
Proportion of Global Indicators for each Goal that have data reported on the UK National Reporting Platform, as at June 2019
Current reporting by the UK
With responsibility for collating UK data for the indicators, the UK’s Office for National Statistics (ONS) is committed to sourcing data that gives the clearest picture of the UK’s contribution to the Goals and checking the validity of the data using the UK Code of Practice for Statistics. 
As of June 2019, the ONS reports UK data on 180 (74%) indicators of the total 244. 
This data is reported on the ONS’ National Reporting Platform in an open and transparent way, showing the indicators the UK has data for, their data source and any other relevant information. The National Reporting Platform may not always use the same data source as the UK’s Voluntary National Review. For example, while the Global Indicator 3.4.1 asks about deaths related to non-communicable diseases including diabetes, the Voluntary National Review looks at those at risk of developing diabetes because this information is more useful in the UK when considering preventative measures. 
Case study: Designing a free, reusable and customisable national reporting platform for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
“Open SDG” is a reporting platform developed for managing and publishing data and statistics related to the Goals. Built exclusively with opensource libraries and tools, it is freely available for any country or organisation to reuse and can be hosted and maintained using free services. 
The Open SDG platform is the result of collaboration between the US Government,  the UK Office for National Statistics, and the non-profit Center for Open Data Enterprise. It merges early versions of the US and UK platforms, including new options for data visualisations and multilingual functionality. It is free, can be modified to fit a variety of user needs, and comes with many customisable tools and features. Several other countries around the world have adopted the Open SDG platform, including Ghana, Poland, Armenia and Rwanda.
 
The National Reporting Platform aims to report data which meet the global metadata for each indicator as closely as possible, whereas other data sources may be more relevant in a UK context.
Inclusive, disaggregated data
Timely, comprehensive and disaggregated (broken down) data is necessary to achieve leaving no one behind and to make the invisible visible. Data is only disaggregated in a way that does not identify individuals, in accordance with the UK Code of Practice for Statistics but draws attention to the groups who may need the most support. Highlighting these vulnerable groups will help decision makers and civil society organisations to understand who is at risk of being left behind, to develop targeted, effective policies and programmes. 
Of the 180 indicators for which UK data is being reported, over 70% are disaggregated by at least one variable. The UK is committed to filling disaggregation gaps and plans to disaggregate data for the Goals by: age, sex, disability status, ethnicity, income, geography and migratory status, wherever possible.  This commitment is outlined in the Inclusive Data Action Plan (2018). This action plan was developed by the ONS in collaboration with the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data (GPSDD) Leave No One Behind Data Collaborative.
Some indicators specify additional disaggregations, for example, pregnant women, or industry sector. The UK disaggregates data by other characteristics, where relevant; for example, the ONS is reporting disaggregated data on domestic abuse by sexual identity (Global Indicator 5.2.1).
The Data Picture: The power of data disaggregation
Data disaggregation is key to understanding which groups are at risk of being left behind. For example, the Global Indicator on violence against women and girls tells us: 
In 2017/18, 6.3% of women experienced partner abuse in the last 12 months (Global Indicator 5.2.1). This has remained fairly stable since 2015/16. Non-sexual partner abuse was one of the most common forms of abuse against women. 
However, when data is broken down by disaggregation it becomes evident who is most at risk.
Women are more likely to experience partner abuse if any of the following apply: • Are under 24 years of age
• Have a disability or long-term illness
• Identify as bisexual
• Have more than one ethnicity 
• Live in a household with an income of less than £10,000
• Live in social housing

A programme of transformation across the UK Government Statistical Service aims to increase impact and reach of statistical data. In line with this transformation, and to meet changing user needs, the ONS plans to use new and innovative types of data, such as Earth observation. Earth observation describes a wide set of data collection tools (such as meteorological stations) that describe the Earth’s surface but is usually used to describe satellite imagery. The ONS plans to use administrative data to report on some of the Global Indicators. This data is built up through daily activities and record keeping. Examples include health records and tax data. 
With the introduction of the Digital Economy Act 2017 there will be an increase in the type and amount of data that the ONS can access, including administrative data and big data. This will help with the development of new ways of measuring UK progress towards the Goals. It will enable the ONS to bring together information from numerous sources, which could be linked and allow the UK to carry out more detailed research. This can also provide further break downs to help highlight the groups who are being left behind. For example, linking deaths from suicide data to higher education data provided new information about student deaths.16 As the ONS starts to use more administrative and non-official data sources, and innovative data types, the UK will be able to report more of the characteristics required for disaggregation. Non-Official Data
Organisations and businesses own or collect data which can be a rich source of information that can be used to complement government data. A good example is the use of the data that the company LINK owns about cash machine locations and characteristics. Through the Digital Economy Act 2017, the ONS is working with LINK, to get access to detailed data which can then be used to analyse where cashpoints are and what functions they have, such as how accessible they are to those living in rural communities, or whether they have technology to assist partially sighted people. This approach is helping to provide data for indicators and disaggregations that the ONS currently are unable to report.
To ensure the robustness of data from non-official sources, the ONS is applying the UK Code of Practice for Statistics which sets the standards for official statistics to ensure the public can have confidence in them. Geographical coverage 
The UK’s devolution arrangements mean that data availability and definitions have diverged, as statisticians in devolved administrations collect and produce data that best meet the needs of the local policy context. This means that compiling data for the whole of the UK can be a challenge in some areas. The UK is working towards reporting data from across the whole of the UK and statisticians from across the UK are working with the ONS to consider the best way of achieving that outcome. Nevertheless, the fact that data is collected in the UK in different ways, to suit different policy requirements, is in line with the spirit of the Goals. 
Challenges and next steps
Access to, and a general lack of, appropriate data is the main challenge to fully reporting on UK progress towards the Goals. This can take many forms and is not a challenge unique to the UK. 
UN Tier data
The ONS is currently reporting UK data on 83% of the UN Tier 1 indicators. The full 100% cannot be reported on because in some cases the data is not routinely collected in the UK, such as the prevalence of stunting (impaired growth and development in children). In cases like this, the ONS is working with topic experts to identify the best data source available to the UK.
The indicators have been divided into tiers by the UN, depending on the existence of agreed standards or methods and the availability of data: 
• Tier 1: indicator is conceptually clear, has internationally-established methodology and standards, and data is regularly produced for at least 50% of countries and of the population in every region where the indicator is relevant.
• Tier 2: indicator is conceptually clear, has internationally established methodology and standards, but data is not regularly produced by countries.
• Tier 3: no internationally established methodology or standards available yet, but methodology or standards are being 
(or will be) developed or tested
Number and proportion of indicators for each tier that have data reported on the  UK National Reporting Platform, as of June 
2019
Where indicators are not accompanied by agreed methods and/or standards (UN Tier 3), it can be difficult to report progress towards them. However, the ONS is using proxy data to report data for 47% of UN Tier 3 indicators, details of which can be found in the Statistical Annex. In these instances, the ONS reports the most relevant source of data based on the indicator title. The data for these indicators will be reassessed once global methodologies are agreed. The ONS is contributing to the development of these methodologies. For example, Global Indicator 9.1.1 (proportion of the rural population who live within 2 km of an all-season road). The methodology for this indicator was developed by the ONS in 2018 through collaboration with Ordnance Survey (OS). As OS data is not available in other countries, work is continuing to identify potential data sources that could provide globally-consistent estimates for this indicator. 
New data
Stakeholder feedback during the development of the Voluntary National Review has shown that the UK needs to source better data to fully understand interlinkages between the Goals, Global Targets and Global Indicators, for example, where those in poverty may be more likely to have poorer health. 
Over the next year, the ONS plans to:
• introduce mechanisms for data exchange; 
• identify new methods and innovations for data collection; 
• look at the economic case for the Goals in a project designed to engage university students in the 2030 Agenda; 
• work on interlinkages between Global Targets based on user research; and
• strengthen user research activities by having largerscale user research, usability testing and accessibility testing of the National Reporting Platform.
Case study: Goal 2, food insecurity
To improve official statistics on food insecurity, the ONS collaborated with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) (the Custodian Agency for this indicator) and academic experts to convene a roundtable bringing together representatives from across UK government alongside civil society organisations, such as the Independent Food Aid Network, Food Foundation, and Feeding Britain. The event centred around the strong and growing user need for better statistics on food insecurity, and culminated in inclusion of food insecurity questions on the UK’s Family Resources Survey (FRS). This will allow for increased disaggregation in various characteristics including geography, disability and economic factors. 
Data used in the Voluntary National Review
In the UK-focussed parts of the Voluntary National Review, the following data sources have been used:
• Global Indicator data where appropriate. This data can be explored further in the Statistical Annex or via the National Reporting Platform. The Global Indicators have been produced for both developing and developed countries, so they do not cover everything that is relevant in the UK; 
• other government sources are drawn upon throughout the Voluntary National Review to fill the data gaps left by the Global Indicators – such as statistics on the Gender Pay Gap. This paints a fuller picture of UK progress towards the Goals. These statistics are communicated in the chapters via detailed narrative and data picture boxes. A link to the data source is provided; and
• some non-government sources to add objectivity and contextual information. Examples of nongovernmental data used include comparison to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) international education survey and use of Waste and Resource Action Programme (WRAP) data on the amount of food waste.
Wherever possible, the data used is sourced or calculated from publicly-available documents, in such a way that members of the public could reproduce the figures. Decisions on data use, such as how best to balance the relevance and public availability of data sources, have been made by the statisticians in each nation.
The Voluntary National Review is a snapshot in time. 
Source links can be used to investigate updated data. 
Data relating to Scotland draws on the most appropriate and relevant data to describe performance and challenges in realising the Goals, Scotland’s National Performance Framework  (NPF) indicator data features throughout this Voluntary National Review where it effectively highlights performance and challenges in realising the Goals. In addition, data from official and non-government sources has been identified to supplement NPF indicator data on specific targets and issues where it is important to illustrate progress with data closely matching the relevant Goal, Target or Indicator. The UK’s Voluntary National Review does not reflect all relevant Scottish specific data, this can be found in the Scottish Supplementary Review here:  www.nationalperformance.gov.scot. 
In Wales, the measurement framework for sustainable development is set out through the Well-being of Future Generations Act. This mechanism ensures that Welsh Ministers are monitoring progress towards the seven statutory well-being goals through 46 national well-being indicators and the annual Well-being of Wales 2017-18 report. These also provide the context for understanding Welsh progress against the Goals using the indicators that are most relevant to Wales and that were developed through significant public engagement. The Well-being of Wales 2017-18 report from September 2018 has been drawn heavily upon for this report and hence some of the data may not be the most recently available. 
Welsh statisticians have developed an online tool to illustrate how these national indicators map against the Goals demonstrating that there is good coverage across the Goals. Within the annual Well-being of Wales report, statisticians also draw on a range of data sources (both official statistics and otherwise) to develop a rounded narrative of well-being and other aspects of the Goals.
The Northern Ireland contributions to the Voluntary 
National Review draw on Northern Ireland’s draft Programme for Government (PfG) Indicators. A mapping exercise has been carried out to highlight how the draft PfG (12 Outcomes and 49 population Indicators) aligns with the Goals. The monitoring arrangements for the draft PfG will show how Northern Ireland is progressing towards the Goals. Northern Ireland’s data can be investigated further using the Outcomes Viewer. 
UK action around the world 
The UK is a global leader in data and is at the forefront of supporting statistical capacity building around the world:
• At the country level: the UK supports countries in strengthening and modernising their national statistical systems to enable them to gather and analyse good quality disaggregated data. This includes programmes in Nepal and Malawi and strategic partnerships, through the ONS, in Ghana, Kenya, Rwanda and the UN Economic Commission for Africa. These partnerships are progressing well and the ONS is now expanding this work to more countries. 
• At the global Level: the UK is pressing the international system to coordinate support for data and to align behind the priorities of countries they are supporting. The UK is working on common priorities across countries, including:
• a Goal monitoring programme operating in  
19 countries;
• the ‘Statistics for Results Facility’ which includes eight countries;
• work on economic and agricultural statistics; and
• a geospatial programme aiming to improve population estimates. 
 
 
The UK supports co-ordination bodies such as PARIS21 which work with national statistics offices to develop strategies, gain funding for them and share good practice. The UK also backs the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data (GPSDD), a network of governments, private sector, and civil society organisations dedicated to harnessing the data revolution to achieve the Goals. The ONS is supporting other countries by explaining how data are collected and how relevant sources are selected from a variety of different places, including using non-official data and creating new methodologies.
for improved population estimates.
Case study: Innovation in Geospatial Data
Many developing countries lack the up-to-date, local level estimates of population, that are needed to plan services. GRID3 is helping developing countries better understand where populations are distributed, and the location of key features such as roads, hospitals and schools. This enables better planning of public services and more intelligent targeting of resources. The programme is currently working in Nigeria, Zambia, Mozambique and Democratic Republic of Congo and has conducted scoping missions to Tanzania, Ethiopia, and South Sudan. 
This programme is jointly funded by DFID and the Gates Foundation and works with the University of Southampton, Columbia Earth Institute and the United Nations Population Fund. It develops models to produce local level population estimates using satellite imagery which are then ‘ground-truthed’ with data from micro-censuses.
In Nigeria the data is also being used to plan vaccination campaigns and other services. The use of mobile phone data is now being explored to provide more accurate local level population estimates.
Case study: ONS international development
Rwanda and Ghana were two of the first countries to replicate the UK National Reporting Platform. Two members of the ONS team visited Rwanda to train the National Institute of Statistics Rwanda and the Ghana Statistical Service to prepare, manage and upload data and metadata to their national reporting platforms. This included: identifying data sources, cleaning and transforming data, providing tutorials and guidance, and ensuring attendees had the system permissions and the experience needed to continue the work after the visit. In the long-term, it is hoped that Rwanda and Ghana might use this training to assist other African countries in the development of their own websites.
The week resulted in over 30 indicators being published across 11 multi-disciplinary Goals. Most were disaggregated by geography, and some by sex. Indicator 3.2.1 (under-5 mortality) included an interactive map based on code from the ONS Geography team. The speed with which this was achieved demonstrates the commitment of these countries to measure the Goals, and the importance of face-toface interaction during statistical capacity-building overseas.• Through innovation: The UK supports innovations that have the potential to be transformative, including the use of satellite imagery and big data 

The UK government’s Department for International 
Development’s (DFID) Inclusive Data Action Plan (2019) sets out how the UK will achieve the vision of the Inclusive Data Charter (2018) that the Goals “should be disaggregated, where relevant by income, sex, age, race, ethnicity, migratory status, disability and geographic location, or other characteristics, in accordance with the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics” General Assembly Resolution 68/261. The UK advocates for and supports partner countries in undertaking national censuses and to build their civil vital registration systems as a fundamental building block to assist all types of data disaggregation.
UK engagement on age statistics and agedisaggregation has been instrumental in bringing together a coalition of committed partners. The ONS, with help from DFID, has led on the establishment of a new international group to improve data on ageing and age disaggregation – the Titchfield City Group on Ageing and Age-disaggregated Data. This was agreed by the UN Statistical Commission in March 2018 and will play a leading role in driving quality in ageing and age-disaggregated data systems around the world. 

Case Study: Making disability visible in schools in Zimbabwe
The Improving Gender Attributes, Transition and Education Outcomes (IGATE-T) programme has been running in Zimbabwe since 2017 and is part of DFID’s Girls’ Education Challenge Fund. It aims to support the learning of over 70,000 girls and help them transition from primary education to secondary school or community-based learning. The IGATE-T team recognised that inclusion of children with disabilities is fundamental in achieving the Goals – especially Goal 10: Reduced Inequalities. There is a cycle of disability and poverty which can only be broken by systematically ensuring that persons with disabilities are included in, and benefit from, education. Due to stigmatisation, discrimination and societal barriers, people with disabilities fail to access opportunities on an equal basis with others.
To address this, IGATE-T ran a baseline survey using the Washington Group questions on disability to better understand the girls targeted by the programme. The survey revealed that a higher proportion of learners in the IGATE-T schools had a disability than had originally been expected. As a result, the IGATE-T team increased its focus on disability inclusion, taking an explicitly inclusive approach to address the needs of all learners alongside introducing positive inclusive messaging. The evidence provided by disaggregating data by disability has been critical to the IGATE-T team in adapting the programme to deal with disability inclusion.
Meeting the promise to Leave No One Behind

The UK played a key role in ensuring that Leave No One Behind became a core principle of the Goals, and pledged to put the last first by ensuring that;
• every person has a fair opportunity in life no matter who or where they are;
• people who are furthest behind, who have least opportunity, and who are the most excluded are prioritised; and
• every person counts and will be counted.
This commitment to Leave No One Behind reflects the value placed on each and every individual across the world, irrespective of sex, disability, age, race, religion or belief, or sexual orientation. It is a recognition that when people are marginalised or excluded, societies are less stable and economies are weaker. When people are left behind, everyone suffers the consequences. 
At all levels the UK works to understand who, where, and why people are being left behind; include people by delivering targeted programmes and services to those who are seldom heard; and empower people to be agents of change by working with others to challenge discrimination and harmful social norms. Understanding who is being left behind 
Access to good quality disaggregated data enables decision-makers to understand who is being left behind (or is at risk of being left behind) and support the development of inclusive policies. 
For example, the Race Disparity Audit (led by UK government) is challenging society to “explain or change” disparities in how people from different backgrounds are being treated by public services. Findings from this Audit indicated that women from Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds are the least likely to be employed.17 Using these findings, combined with data on areas with high levels of ethnic minority unemployment, some Jobcentres have implemented local plans to tackle this and other issues identified in the Audit. For example, in Birmingham, Pakistani and Bangladeshi women have been offered 1-2-1 employment drop in services to help them move into work or take up training.
Activity snapshot: 
Governments are not alone in using disaggregated data to inform policies and programmes. The ‘Everybody Counts’ project by Sightsavers is looking into new ways of collecting data on inclusion of people with disabilities in development programmes. Using the Washington Group Short Set of Questions which assess level of functioning in six different areas has enabled Sightsavers to collect more accurate data on disabilities than national censuses. This has facilitated identification and removal of potential physical barriers to Sightsavers’ development programmes and has had a positive impact on health workers’ understanding and attitude towards people with disabilities.
Including those being left behind 
Ensuring that everyone is included in economies, societies, institutions and service provisions requires government, employers, local authorities and individuals to step up. 
For example, the Loneliness Strategy in England seeks to tackle the drivers of loneliness through a cross-government fund that has supported 126 organisations to tackle loneliness, as well as the development of 60 new policies by making changes to organisations, infrastructure and culture. Many of these policies seek to tackle loneliness, particularly among at risk groups, including:
• Children and young people – Primary and secondary school children in England will be taught how to build healthy relationships and understand the impact of loneliness, particularly on mental health. 
• Disabled people, people with poor health or longterm illness, and carers – All local health and care systems in England will be helped to implement social prescribing connector schemes by 2023. Social prescribing connects people to community groups and services through connector schemes where ‘link workers’ introduce people to nearby support based on their individual needs. 
• Isolated Older People – A collaboration between the UK government, Royal Mail, private enterprise, local authorities and the local voluntary sector will trial ‘Safe and Connected’. This innovative digital solution will see postal workers calling on lonely older people who sign up to participate, as part of their usual delivery rounds. Postal workers will ask a standard set of questions to assess individual needs. Answers will then be analysed by a professional who will direct the individual to friends, family, or local voluntary sector services, as necessary. 
Empowering those being left behind
In order to spur meaningful change, vulnerable and excluded groups must be given the tools and opportunities they need to change their own lives. Greater participation in the community, the economy and in local decision-making by those who are disadvantaged, is an essential ingredient for sustained growth and prosperity.
For example, in England the Integration Area Programme is working with five local authorities to produce locally-focussed integration strategies. This includes Walsall Council which is creating an English Language Intelligence Unit that will act as a single point of contact linking those in Walsall who speak English as their second language to appropriate English language courses. Improving English language skills is crucial to supporting and empowering potential learners to access the services they need, including employment opportunities.
Internationally, the UK prioritises work that targets the most vulnerable and disadvantaged, the most excluded, those caught in crises and those most at risk of violence and discrimination. The Voice and Accountability Programme in Pakistan – AAWAZ – has contributed to more open, inclusive and accountable governance in two provinces in Pakistan by protecting and expanding public spaces for poor and excluded people, especially women, minority groups and transgender people in 4,500 villages. Now over 30,000 women hold leadership and decision-making positions in citizen groups and networks, as members of local women’s assemblies, change-makers, peaceconnectors and youth leaders.18
Devolved administrations
Scotland’s National Performance Framework (NPF) has reducing inequalities at its heart. A range of legislation, plans and policies in Scotland support the agenda to Leave No One Behind. Building on the Public Sector Equality Duty, the Fairer Scotland Duty was introduced in April 2018. It places a legal responsibility on the Scottish Government and a range of public bodies in Scotland to actively consider how they can reduce inequalities of outcomes caused by socio-economic disadvantage, when making strategic decisions. This is supported by the Equality Evidence Finder - a key resource for finding equality evidence to inform decision-making.
 ‘A more equal Wales’ is one of seven well-being goals in the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015. This sets out an ambition for ‘a society that enables people to fulfil their potential no matter what their background or circumstance’. When working towards this goal, public bodies in Wales are expected to work in a way that involves the full diversity of people from across society. Locating fair work within the aim to make Wales a more equal society is vitally important. The definition of fair work in the recently published Fair Work Wales (2019) report will help inform the actions needed to achieve the seven wellbeing goals. 
In Northern Ireland, the Outcomes Delivery Plan is prepared around 12 outcomes in key areas of societal and economic well-being. It sets out how the work of the Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS) will contribute to the objective of ‘improving well-being for all – by tackling disadvantage and driving economic growth’.

Goal 1: No Poverty
End poverty in all its forms everywhere
Summary 
Poverty is complex. Income transfers alone do not break the cycle of long-term disadvantage. Poverty statistics take account of welfare spending that people receive as income from government but do not show the impact of additional spending on services such as education and health which will also have a positive impact on people’s lives. 
The UK is committed to tackling all forms of poverty, including childhood disadvantage and in-work poverty, at home and abroad. The UK government supports full employment and higher pay as the best long-term route out of poverty. Growth in UK employment rates over the last decade has benefitted the poorest 20% of households, whose employment rate is now more than 7 percentage points higher than in 2007/08.19
While an increase in employment has driven up earnings in recent years in real terms, the UK government believes strongly in supporting those not in work and also spends £55 billion on support for disabled people and over £120 billion on support for pensioners.20
The Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland Civil Service have different and distinct approaches to ending poverty.
Internationally, the UK’s Aid Strategy (2015) commits to tackling extreme poverty by promoting inclusive economic growth, quality jobs and trade alongside investment in social protection.
Ending poverty is contingent on making progress across many Goals. This chapter focusses on assessments of absolute and relative poverty for various groups across the UK, and policy responses through direct measures, particularly employment and welfare strategies. Food security (2), health and education (3 and 4), affordable energy (7), equality (10), and affordable housing (11), are discussed in greater detail in other chapters.
Leave No One Behind examples:
• The UK is investing up to £115 million of funding to support the work and health agenda to enable investment in new models and to build the evidence of what works – this includes more than doubling the number of Employment Advisers in Improving Access to Psychological Therapies services.
• In Scotland, the Fairer Scotland Duty introduced in April 2018 requires local and national government and a range of other public bodies to consider how they can reduce inequalities of outcome caused by socioeconomic disadvantage when making strategic decisions. 
• Wales is committed to introducing the socio-economic duty to promote prosperity and tackle inequality. Wales has also appointed an independent Fair Work Commission to make recommendations on how to encourage and promote fair employment practices with a view to making Wales a fair work nation. 
• Northern Ireland’s Food Poverty Plan for Belfast, a collaborative response from 27 organisations, tackles food poverty across seven themes, including holiday hunger and diet-related ill health. 
• Internationally, investment in the economic empowerment of women and girls is a critical step to end poverty sustainably. Since 2014, the UK-funded SPRING (Assets to Adolescent Girl’s Programme) business accelerator has reached over 589,000 girls through its businesses, surpassing its target of reaching 200,000 globally.

Action in the UK
The UK is committed to addressing poverty in all its dimensions and believes that, in the long run, the cycle of inter-generational poverty can only be broken through a focus on the root causes of poverty. 
Tackling All Forms of Poverty (1.1 and 1.2)
Poverty data and measurement
The UK has long been at the forefront of understanding and measuring poverty and invests significant resources in maintaining and improving a rich set of data on household income, wealth and opportunities.21
Activity snapshot: 
In September 2018, the Social Metrics 
Commission (SMC) published the ‘A New Measure of Poverty in the UK’ report in which they proposed a new method for measuring poverty. The SMC is an independent commission that was formed with the aim of developing a new approach to poverty measurement that both better reflects the nature and experiences of poverty that different families in the UK have and can be used to build a consensus around poverty measurement and action in the UK. In May 2019 the UK announced it would be publishing new experimental statistics based on the SMC approach and would be working with the SMC and other stakeholders to develop these statistics further.
Working age households 
Working age poverty rates in the UK have reduced slightly since 2009 for absolute poverty and have been broadly stable for relative poverty. 
The Data Picture:  
Working age poverty
Coverage: UK
In 2017/18, 13% of working age individuals in the UK were in absolute poverty before housing costs (BHC) and 20% were in relative poverty after housing costs (AHC). AHC rates of poverty fell between 2015/16 and 2017/18 while BHC rates of poverty remained stable.

Child poverty and lone parent families
Absolute and relative child poverty rates have been broadly stable in the UK over the past decade.
The Data Picture: Child poverty
Coverage: UK
Rates of absolute and relative child poverty since 2009/10 have stayed around 20% BHC and around 30% AHC. Between 2015/16 and 2017/18 AHC rates of poverty remained stable or declined while BHC rates of poverty rose.

Children of lone parents
Coverage: UK
In 2017/18, 31% of lone parent families were in relative poverty BHC and 47% AHC. The percentages for absolute poverty were 26% and 43% for BHC and AHC respectively. 
Since 2015/16, relative AHC rates of poverty for children of lone parents have remained stable, but rates of BHC poverty and absolute AHC poverty have risen.

HBAI 2017/18
Child poverty rates are markedly higher in the UK in lone parent families, 86% of which are headed by women.22 In 2017/18, 47% of children in lone parent households were in relative poverty after housing costs (AHC) compared to 25% of children in households made up of couples.23 The UK recognises the barriers lone parents face in working full-time, particularly in accessing suitable and affordable childcare. To address this, the UK invests in free and subsidised childcare, including offering a reimbursement of up to 85% of childcare costs in Universal Credit, a 20% top up to childcare costs through Tax-Free Childcare and spending around £3.5 billion on early education entitlements in England.24
Activity snapshot: 
To target particularly disadvantaged children, around 150 local authorities across England are delivering the Troubled Families Programme to support families with multiple and overlapping disadvantages. The second phase was launched with a £920 million investment in 2015 to support a further 400,000 families by 2020 through dedicated and coordinated ‘whole-offamily’ support. From September 2014 to March 2019, over 20,000 families achieved continuous employment outcomes. 
Disabled people
Health and disability issues affect the working lives of millions of people, with around 18% of working-age UK adults reporting having a disability.25 Individuals in families with a disabled member face a higher risk of poverty than households without any disabled members. The UK government’s 2019/20 spending on the main disability benefits – Personal Independence Payment (PIP), Disability Living Allowance (DLA) and Attendance Allowance – is forecast to be over £6 billion higher in real terms than in 2009/10, and more than £2 billion higher than in 2015/16 (see Goal 10).26 
The Data Picture: Disability poverty
Coverage: UK
Absolute poverty measures for families with a disabled member have fallen since 2013/14. Relative measures have remained more stable over the same time period.

Pensioners
Around 18% of the UK population were aged 65+ in mid-2017 and this is projected to increase to over 20% by 2027 according to the ONS population estimates. 
For pensioners, a commitment is in place until 2020, guaranteeing that the basic and new State Pensions will rise by the highest of average earnings growth, price inflation, or 2.5%. In 2018/19 the increase was 3%.27 From 2015/16 to 2019/20 the value of the basic state pension increased by 11.4% (£115.95 to £129.20). 
The Data Picture: Pensioner poverty
Coverage: UK
Average pensioner incomes have grown significantly in real terms over the last two decades (average weekly income in 1994/95 was £161 a week AHC, in 2017/18 prices, compared to £304 a week in 2017/18), driven by increases in the contributory basic state pension and the level and increases in the means-tested benefit, as well as increases in income from occupational pensions.
Rates of poverty for pensioners have remained stable between 2015/16 and 2017/18, except for relative BHC rates which have increased.

Social Protection and access to resources and services for all (1.3, 1.4, 1.b)
In terms of public spending in the UK, including additional investment in the National Health Service in England, the poorest 10% of households in the UK receive over 70% more than the richest 10%.28 Not all public spending is captured in income-based measures.
Welfare reform and fiscal policy
The UK government is part-way through the biggest welfare reform programme for a generation. Universal Credit is replacing the six main means-tested benefits and tax credits with one single, monthly payment. Strong employment incentives are reinforced by the National Living Wage and the rising Personal Tax Allowance, which work together to promote independence from benefits. 
The increase in the National Living Wage to £8.21 in April 2019 will benefit at least 2.1 million people.29
Tax changes introduced by the UK government will make basic rate tax-payers over £1,200 better off in real terms from April 2019, compared with 2010.

In-work poverty
UK-wide, the percentage of working age adults in working families in poverty has remained stable since 2009/10 at around 15% on a relative AHC basis and around 9% on an absolute poverty before housing costs (BHC) basis. More people in work has resulted in a shift between the number of people in in-work poverty and the number of workless people in poverty. There were 4.8 million adults in working families in relative AHC poverty in 2017/18 compared to 4.1 million in 2009/10, while for adults in workless families this figure had fallen to 3.2 million in 2017/18 from 3.8 million in 2009/10.30
In 2017/18, for couples with children, there was only a 7% risk of children being in relative poverty (after housing costs) if both parents worked full-time. However, this increased to a 66% risk of child poverty for couples with only part-time work.31
Promoting full-time work and making sure it sufficiently pays is a key plank of the UK government’s anti-poverty strategy. In the UK, unemployment in the three months to March 2019 fell to 1.3 million and the number of people in work was at a near record high at 32.7 million. There were over 1.5 million more people in work from Jan-March 2019 compared with Jan-March 2015 and over 85% of the growth has been in fulltime work, which substantially reduces the risk of poverty.32 Average wages in the UK have grown faster than inflation in the 14 months to March 2019 (see Goal 8).33
Housing costs 
Poverty rates are higher when measured after, rather than before, housing costs. In 2017/18, 15% of individuals in the UK were in absolute poverty BHC and 19% AHC. This reflects higher housing costs for private renting and trends in tenure with more working-age families renting privately than owning their home (see Goal 11).34 High housing and energy costs also contribute to fuel poverty (see Goal 7).
Activity snapshot: 
A pioneering “pop-up” hostel by Salvation 
Army Ilford and Redbridge Council, aimed at tackling homelessness in Ilford, received planning permission in 2018. Project Malachi aims to create a temporary hostel for rough sleepers and homeless people to rebuild their lives. It will use recycled shipping containers to create and provide training to teach bicycle repair skills to people classified as ‘No Recourse to Public Funds’ by local authorities, meaning they are not able to claim most benefits, tax credits or housing assistance paid by the state.
Reducing Vulnerability and Building Resilience 
(1.5) 
The Resilience Capabilities Programme aims to increase the UK’s capability to respond to and recover from civil emergencies, working with a wide range of stakeholders. The programme coordinates preparedness efforts to build the resilience of all in the UK, including those in vulnerable situations, and to reduce overall exposure and vulnerability. 
The National Risk Register outlines key risks that have the potential to cause significant disruption to the UK, along with actions that people and businesses can take to protect themselves. Partnerships with business, civil society and other stakeholders have been established to develop new and innovative data approaches to measure domestic targets set out in the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, and to create new estimates of disaster mortality which align with hazards listed in the National Risk Register (see Goal 11).
Activity snapshot: 
Public Health England (PHE) completed a review of progress against the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction in 2017. The review demonstrated how PHE is delivering on the framework’s level of ambition within the UK and strengthening the UK’s worldleading preparedness expertise. This includes ensuring local and cross-England disaster risk reduction strategies are in place by 2020, on which England has already made great progress through development and implementation of extreme weather plans. 
Scotland
Scotland’s National Performance Framework, underpinned by legislation, has a specific National Outcome that “we tackle poverty by sharing opportunities, wealth and power more equally.” Universal access to healthcare and free education with more progressive taxation are an important backdrop. 
Tackling poverty and creating a fairer Scotland (1.2)
It is estimated that 24% of children in Scotland were living in relative poverty after housing costs in 201518 and in-work poverty for working age adults has continually increased to 60% in 2015-18.35
The complexity of tackling poverty is recognised. Scotland has a range of policies, plans and actions in place relating to this Goal, including targets in law (Child Poverty (Scotland) Act 2017) towards the eradication of child poverty, supported by a delivery plan and funding (Every Child, Every Chance).
The Data Picture:  
Absolute and relative poverty
Coverage: Scotland
After housing costs, 18% of people in Scotland were living in absolute poverty in 2015-18 and 20% of people in Scotland were living in relative poverty in 2015-18, representing approximately one million people each year.

Report on persistent poverty based on Understanding Society survey data
Actions to create a fairer Scotland include:
• Establishing a Poverty and Inequality Commission to provide independent advice to Scottish Ministers on reducing poverty and inequality.
• Not-for-profit social lenders providing affordable lending and savings in the heart of communities to protect people from predatory lenders and unmanageable debt.
• Local authorities and the third sector working in partnership to establish shared premises hubs to make it easier for people to access advice and support services.
• A new Financial Health Check service accessed through Citizens Advice network in Scotland which helps parents maximise incomes, reduce household costs, and help avoid the ‘poverty premium’ of paying more for essential goods and services.
• Empowering Communities Fund, supporting 450 community bodies and organisations since 2015 to deliver community led-projects such as skills and learning to increase employment opportunities and increased access to affordable childcare.
• Poverty Truth Commission bringing people in poverty together with people in positions of power.
• Affordable Housing Supply Programme helping to revitalise some of the most deprived areas in Scotland with over £3 billion investment in the delivery of 50,000 affordable homes, 35,000 of which will be for social rent.

Scotland is in the midst of an unprecedented level of investment in early years of life, to support better outcomes for children and their families. Universal measures including the expansion of early learning and childcare to 1,140 hours for all three- and four-yearolds by August 2020, relevant to this and other Goals, will save a family around £4,500 per child a year.37 The Leave No One Behind agenda is supported by funded early learning and childcare for around a quarter of two-year-olds where parents are in receipt of specified benefits or are seeking asylum.
Scotland is taking forward a new social security system based on dignity, fairness and respect, being shaped by those with lived experience. Scotland has invested significantly in mitigating the impact of welfare reform on people’s lives (£125 million in 2018-19), however this remains a challenge.
A range of actions and policies, within Scotland’s devolved powers, are designed to boost household incomes at local and national level. This includes the Council Tax Reduction Scheme and, to support those in crisis, the Scottish Welfare Fund.
Sustainable and fair work is a long-term route out of poverty and 80.6% of employees in Scotland are paid the living wage38 with targets in place to lift at least a further 25,000 people to earning the living wage. 
To tackle the inequalities that older people face, A Fairer Scotland for Older People: framework for action was published in April 2019. The framework is shaped by the voices of older people and focuses on older people in their communities; accessing services; and financial security. For example, the Scottish 
Government and Age UK worked together to raise awareness of the financial support available to older people. An estimated £292 million in Pension Credit and Housing Benefit goes unclaimed each year.39 Increasing public awareness of these benefits would help lower poverty levels among older people. 
Wales
Tackling All Forms of Poverty (1.1 and 1.2) 
Relative poverty in Wales has remained steady for over a decade and is highest amongst children. Relative income poverty is a measure of income inequality, not a direct measure of living standards. There are fewer people estimated to be in material deprivation than in relative income poverty.40 Wales has focussed relentlessly on the root causes of poverty - giving children the best possible start in life and helping people into sustainable jobs.
Child poverty
Children are the population group most likely to be in relative income poverty, with the latest data showing that 29% were living in income poverty.41 This has fallen over the past few years. The Child Poverty Strategy underlines the importance of a preventative approach to tackling child poverty, focussing on the early years and employability.
Flying Start supports more than 36,000 children under the age of four and their families each year in some of Wales’s most disadvantaged communities. The Families First programme aims to bring about a change in prevention and early intervention services for children and families. The early years provision in Wales’s new curriculum builds strong key skills and embeds health awareness, well-being, and resilience in children from the earliest stage. Wales is developing Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) aware public services which can take a more preventative approach to tackling ACEs and mitigating their impact through improving the resilience of children and young people.
Older people
There are over 100,000 pensioners living in poverty in Wales. Over the longer term there has been a large reduction in the rate of poverty for pensioners,42 however in recent years this increased slightly. Wales is co-producing a strategy for an ageing society with the Older People’s Commissioner for Wales and older people which adopts a rights-based approach that promotes equality and social justice.
The Data Picture: Children in workless households
Coverage: Wales
In Wales there was a decrease in the percentage of children living in workless households from 2015 (13.7%) to 2017 (12.6%), and a significant fall from a peak of 20% in 2009. In 2017, 27.2% of children in Wales live in a household where at least one (but not all) adult works, and 60.3% live in a household with all adults in work.

Disability
The employment rate among disabled adults aged 16-64 remains lower than among those who are not disabled.43 This gap has remained stable in recent years. The Communities for Work (CfW) programme has supported disabled people in finding training and work by helping them overcome barriers to employment. Action on Disability: The Right to Independent Living will ensure improved access to help, advice and services for disabled people in Wales.
Employability
Wales’s Employability Plan sets out how people can be supported to increase their skills and ensure a coherent pathway for them to enter and progress in employment. Wales’s employability programmes, Jobs Growth Wales, ReAct, CfW, CfW+ Parents, Childcare and Employment, and others have supported tens of thousands of people into work over the last decade.
Working Wales is the all-Wales employability advisory service which provides individualised advice and guidance to support people into Employment. 
Wales’s childcare offer will provide eligible working parents with 30 hours of government-funded early education and childcare for three- and four-year-olds for up to 48 weeks a year.
Fuel poverty 
The recently published headline estimates for fuel poverty in Wales suggest that 155,000 households in Wales are living in fuel poverty, 12% of all households in Wales.44 The installation of energy efficiency measures to more than 50,800 homes in Wales via the Warm Homes Programme has been a contributing factor to the significant reduction in the levels of fuel poverty since 2008. The new fuel poverty estimates will inform a new plan to tackle fuel poverty due to be published in 2020.
In-work poverty 
Underemployment and in-work poverty is a challenge, with many in short-term insecure and low paid jobs. Over half of working-age people living in poverty in 
Wales live in working households.45 In March 2019, Wales’s independent Fair Work Commission reported on these issues and the results are being considered.
Social Protection and Access to Resources and 
Services for All (1.3 and 1.4) 
Welfare reform and fiscal policy
Responsibility for the policy development of welfare reform is not devolved. Wales does not have the resources available to fully address the impact of these changes, however, it continues to mitigate, where possible by providing additional funding to support those most affected. For example, additional investment has been made in frontline advice services to ensure coordinated, cost effective provision and there has been additional funding for the Discretionary Assistance Fund (DAF) which provides crisis payments for people experiencing an emergency and one-off payments to help people to live independently. Other initiatives include the Council Tax Reduction Scheme (CTRS) for those on a low income and the free school meals programme. 
The Wales Centre for Public Policy is exploring the case for the devolved administration of certain aspects of the benefits system and looking at where things might be done differently in Wales.
People in Wales benefit from services outside of direct welfare income that improve people’s lives (known as a “social wage”). These include the education maintenance allowance for those in further education; free transport for over 60’s; free prescriptions; and free school breakfasts.
The Data Picture: Relative 
Income Poverty 
Coverage: Wales
Relative poverty rates in Wales have changed little over the last few years. Over the longer term there has been a large reduction in the rate of poverty for pensioners. However, in recent years 
 	this has begun to increase. The poverty rate is 
much lower for pensioners than other age groups (20% for pensioners, 24% for working-age adults and 28% children).

Fusion is a programme that concentrates on helping Welsh communities experiencing economic disadvantage. These communities traditionally face barriers in accessing culture and heritage, and the benefits they can bring. Between 2015 and 2017, over 5,000 people took part in Fusion activities, working with local authorities, heritage sites, theatres, schools, museums, archives and libraries among others to help over 100 people gain a qualification, create over 300 volunteering opportunities and support more than 1,500 pupils in doing better at school.
Northern Ireland
Recent figures show that the percentage of the population in Northern Ireland living in absolute poverty (before housing costs) has reduced from 20% in 2014/15 to 15% in 2017/18.46 While this is welcome news more needs to be done in tackling poverty and disadvantage and in supporting those who need it most. 
Northern Ireland is continuing to help economically inactive people to move towards the labour market and to find and retain good jobs. The percentage of the Northern Irish population in employment has risen to 
71.3%.47
Business in the Community Northern Ireland delivers a Community Resilience Programme to guide businesses in strategically investing time, skills money and expertise to tackle social issues in those communities most in need.
UK action around the world 
Tackling Extreme Poverty (1.1, 1.a)
The UK is the only G7 country to have enshrined in law a commitment to spend 0.7% of its Gross National Income on Official Development Assistance every year. The UK Aid Strategy (2015) commits to tackling extreme poverty and helping the world’s most vulnerable, striving to eliminate extreme poverty by 2030 and supporting the world’s poorest people to ensure that every person has access to basic needs, including prioritising the rights of girls and women.
Economic growth is essential for overcoming global poverty and for allowing human potential to flourish. The UK has scaled up its work on economic development to deliver ambitious outcomes, more than doubling spending from 2012/13 to 2015/16  
(£1.8 billion).48
The UK’s global investment in cash transfers and broader social protection is a key contributor to Goal 1 and Leave No One Behind. Support to developing country governments helps them to increase the coverage, quality and sustainability of their social protection systems. The UK has increased its focus on girls and women and people with disabilities, on the poorest and most vulnerable in fragile states, and on building social protection systems that can respond to crises, to prevent development gains being reversed. 
Activity snapshot: 
Children’s charity Global Care UK has developed a sponsorship scheme in which children who are marginalised through poverty or disability around the world are matched with a financial sponsor from the UK who supports them with essentials such as education and food. The scheme is delivering additional projects to meet community needs including school buildings and betterquality housing.
Access to Land Rights (1.4)
Secure property rights are a foundation of economic development and social justice. The UK supports many programmes that ensure men and women have equal rights to land and property. Since 2010, the UK has funded land registration programmes across Africa that have issued more than 11.4 million land documents and helped over 6.6 million women improve their rights to land.49 Through LEGEND, a global land governance programme, the UK has promoted responsible investment in land; innovative approaches to land registration, such as the Cadasta Platform used to map land rights using mobile phones; and improved data on land governance, including Prindex, a new global survey of people’s perceptions of land and property rights which will also be used in the UK by the ONS. Women’s Economic Empowerment (1.1, 1.4, 1.b)
The UK is supporting the economic empowerment of women and girls as a critical step to end poverty sustainably. At the global level, the UN High Level Panel on women’s economic empowerment, with the UK’s leadership and influence, has pushed for further action by producing practical toolkits to address the main factors affecting women’s and girls’ economic empowerment. The UK is investing £7.4 million from 2018 onwards in the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative (WeFI), providing women entrepreneurs  with critical financial services.50
Activity snapshot: 
Global Citizen is an online advocacy and campaigning platform in the UK, encouraging young people to learn about and take action to achieve a world free from extreme poverty by 2030. Its unique model rewards Global Citizens for their voice, offering free tickets to events. Current membership totals 2 million globally. Global Citizens have taken over 21 million actions, resulting in nearly US$38 billion in commitments to tackle extreme poverty – whether from governments, businesses or philanthropists. These commitments are set to affect the lives of 2.25 billion people around the world.
Challenges and next steps
Poverty is complex, and income transfers alone do not break the cycle of long-term disadvantage. The UK is committed to tackling all forms of poverty, including childhood disadvantage and in-work poverty, at home and abroad.
Multi-dimensional child poverty and measurement
The proportion of children in UK households with a combination of low income (below 70% of median income) and material deprivation, including access to essentials and inclusion in activities, has declined from 13% in 2010/11 to 12% in 2017/18.51 The UK will continue to monitor poverty trends closely and develop further measurements, including using the new Social Metrics Commission’s measure of disposable income for analysis, in order to understand the causes, consequences and solutions to poverty. To further build evidence on multi-dimensional poverty, Scotland is investing in the new Scottish Poverty and Inequality Research Unit (SPIRU), based at Glasgow Caledonian University. SPIRU is a multi-disciplinary research group providing an independent, evidence-based commentary on poverty, inequality and social policy in Scotland.
Labour market strategies 
There is more to do to tackle the drivers of long-term poverty. Since the 2008 financial crisis, the UK has faced a very challenging fiscal position. The benefit freeze will conclude at the end of 2019/20. By 2022, Universal Credit will provide an additional £2 billion annually compared to the system it replaced.52 For most low-income families more income from employment than benefits has become the norm. The poorest 20% of working-age households and households containing children in 2017/18 received over 50% of their total income from earnings53, up from 43% in 2009/10.54  But there is more to do to tackle in-work poverty.  In the UK, employment will continue to be promoted as the best route out of poverty, with further increases planned to the living wage and personal tax allowance. A focus on in-work progression (to help tackle  in-work poverty) and on the availability and affordability of housing (discussed in Goal 11), will  also continue. These actions complement those outlined in Goal 4 to reduce inequalities in education outcomes, which is a key part of the longer-term  anti-poverty strategy. 
Income Supplement
The development of an income supplement in Scotland is an important next step relating to this Goal. It is a significant commitment that will be guided by two principles: 
• The additional income is targeted on those families who need it, and that it is therefore helping to lift the maximum number of children out of poverty;
• There is a robust and viable delivery route to get the additional income to those families, and that the delivery costs are reasonable.

Goal 2: Zero Hunger
End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture
Summary 
Across the UK, steps are being taken to improve the sustainability of farming and food production and help all consumers to improve the overall balance of food and drink they consume and to choose healthier diets. 
A view of food security requires consideration of the consumer, the UK supply chain and the global context. To better understand food needs and ensure support is targeted at those who need it most, the UK is increasing monitoring of the cases and severity of household food insecurity.
Sustainable agriculture is at the heart of the UK’s ambitious commitment to leave the environment in a better state than it was inherited. Agriculture is important to the UK economy, has environmental value and supports UK supply chains. Land managers are also uniquely placed to address some of the most significant environmental challenges. 
The UK is using its global leadership, expertise and finance to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture for the poorest communities around the world.
This chapter sets out the UK’s approach to ensuring the food system delivers healthy and affordable food for everyone and is built upon a resilient and sustainable agriculture sector, supporting all sectors in contributing positively to the environment. 
Leave No One Behind examples:
• E ngland is helping the most vulnerable afford and have access to nutritious food through initiatives such as the Healthy Start scheme and free school meals for disadvantaged pupils.
• In Scotland, free school meals are provided universally to every pupil in primaries 1 to 3 at all  publicly-funded schools, with free school meals continuing throughout school years for all pupils who meet relevant eligibility criteria in relation to their own or family circumstances, saving families around £400 a year. The Scottish Government’s £3.5 million Fair Food Fund supports dignified responses to food insecurity which help to tackle the causes of poverty.
• The Welsh Food and Fun/Bwyd a Hwyl programme supports schools in areas of high deprivation to provide a nutritious breakfast, lunch, education about healthy eating and wider enrichment activities. In 2018 approximately 2,500 learners benefited across 56 schools. The aim of the scheme is to address issues like food insecurity, holiday learning loss and social exclusion.
• In Northern Ireland, the Belfast Food Network is a founding member of  	Sustainable Food Cities, an alliance of organisations and businesses committed to taking a joined up, holistic approach to food. Key projects include the creation of five Community Shops across the region with £1.5 million secured in funding.
• T he UK is driving global progress through its support as a founding member to the London-based Power of Nutrition financing platform to mobilise US$1 billion in new resources to reduce incidences of stunting by 600,000 around the world. 

Action in the UK
The UK is taking action to deliver food security and improved nutrition for all, and to promote sustainable agriculture and effective land management with a view to improving productivity and growth. Food security and good nutrition (2.1, 2.2)
Food Security
The UK has a high degree of national food security, built on access to a range of sources, strong  domestic production and global imports. Several indicators monitor levels of overall food security on  an ongoing basis. 
The UK Food Security Assessment is a comprehensive analysis of all aspects of food security and was last published in full in 2010. A review is currently in progress, including: Global Food Security; Global Resource Sustainability; UK Availability and Access; UK Supply Chain Resilience; Household Food Security; and Consumer Safety and Confidence.
The challenges in household food insecurity are closely tied to those in Goal 1. The UK government is fully committed to supporting vulnerable people and the approach to tackling poverty in all its forms is set out  in Goal 1. 
Challenges also remain in measuring and addressing every aspect of household food security (discussed further at the end of the chapter). For instance, some food bank networks publish data on the number of parcels they supply, but not all do so,  and current measures of household food security are not at UK level (discussed further at the end of this chapter).
The UK government is exploring how it can build on current good practice to make it as easy as possible for food banks to identify and refer back to the local Jobcentre anyone who may, for a variety of reasons, not be receiving the full formal support to which they are entitled. To shape future evidence-based policy in this area, a review is underway on the drivers of food bank use and will be published before the end of 2019. 
Securing Good Nutrition 
Three Healthy Food Schemes are helping children in the UK receive good nutrition and are reducing health inequalities.   
• Healthy Start Food Vouchers encourage a healthy diet for pregnant women, families and young children from low-income households in England, Wales and, currently, Scotland. Recipients are also eligible for free Healthy Start vitamins.
• The School Fruit and Vegetables Scheme provides children aged four to six at state-funded primary schools in England with a portion of fresh fruit or vegetables each day.  
• The Nursery Milk Scheme provides a reimbursement to childcare providers for a daily portion of milk to children and babies.
From 2018-2020, up to £26 million from Soft Drinks Industry Levy revenues in England will be invested in a breakfast club programme. The programme will introduce or improve breakfast clubs in over 1,700 English schools and will be targeted at the most disadvantaged areas to ensure every child gets the best start in life.

Diet and Healthy Weight
England’s 2016 Childhood Obesity Plan (Chapter One) and the UK-wide 2018 Soft Drinks Industry Levy led to significant changes in the food and drinks industry and its products. In England, a Sugar Reduction programme announced in 2017 included a cross-industry ambition to achieve a 20%55 reduction in sugar levels. By 2018, there had been early reductions in five out of eight food categories where progress was measured.56 Industry guidelines for calorie reduction are also being developed, in order to achieve a 20% reduction by 2024 in products that contribute significantly to children’s calorie intake. 
In England, following part one of the Childhood Obesity Plan, in 2018 Chapter Two made a bold ambition to halve childhood obesity and significantly reduce the gap in obesity between children from the most and least deprived areas by 2030. Key measures include consulting on restricting promotions of unhealthy products by location and price, further advertising restrictions and mandating calorie labelling in restaurants (see Goal 3).

In January 2019, Change4Life launched a national campaign in support of Public Health England’s sugar reduction and reformulation programme, encouraging parents to cut back on sugar by making simple swaps. The campaign encouraged an extensive range of manufacturers and retailers to feature a new ‘Good Choice’ badge in advertising to help families easily spot lower sugar food and drink options.  The campaign also reached 16,500 state-funded primary schools in England with nutrition  take-home resources and teaching materials.
Resilient and productive agriculture, and 
sustainable and innovative food production  (2.3, 2.4)
In the UK 72% of land is used for agriculture.57 
In 2018, the UK government published a 25 Year Environment Plan. Since the UK government is responsible for a number of policies and programmes which affect sectors across the UK and internationally, some aspects of the Plan will apply to the UK as a whole. In other areas environmental policy is devolved and responsibility rests with the Scottish Government, Welsh Government and the Northern Ireland Civil 
Service. The proposals in the 25 Year Environment 
Plan apply to England only. A key component of the Plan, and the subsequent Agriculture Bill, is a new environmental land management system that will deliver environmental benefits and provide flexibility  for farmers by putting decision-making more firmly  in their hands. 
The UK supports agricultural innovation through measures such as the agriculture technologies  (agri-tech) strategy, launched in 2013, which has improved the flow of ideas and solutions from laboratory to farm. It includes £160 million of investment, over five years, in a Catalyst fund and  four world-class centres for Agricultural Innovation. 
The UK’s Plan for Public Procurement: Food and Catering Services aims to simplify the public procurement process and open up the market to more small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and local producers. It provides tools, including the balanced scorecard, to help contracting parties to balance a range of criteria beneficial to the consumer, the environment, and to producers.
Activity snapshot: 
The Coca-Cola Foundation is supporting World 
Wide Fund for Nature-UK, Norfolk Rivers Trust and The Rivers Trust to implement water sensitive farming in East Anglia - restoring healthy rivers and supporting sustainable agriculture supply chains. Since its start in 2012, the project has worked on over 140 farms, improved more than 2,100 hectares of farmland through sustainable land use practices, and raised awareness with over 2,500 farmers. In total, 1.2 billion litres of water have been replenished to the environment.
Increasing Productivity and Driving Growth
The overarching objective of the UK’s Industrial Strategy is to improve living standards and economic growth. The agri-food sector is a significant employer across the UK. From farming through to retail and catering the sector employs 4 million workers, 14% of all UK employment.58
The UK’s Food and Drink Sector Council is developing a new agenda for the industry, capable of boosting productivity, Gross Value Added and securing the UK’s position as a global leader in affordable, safe, sustainable and high-quality food and drink.
The UK has been working with the Food and Drink 
Federation (FDF) to develop a Food and Drink Sector Deal, an industry-led partnership to boost productivity, with proposals focusing on three priority areas: innovation, exports and skills. 
The Transforming Food Production Programme, which has £90 million of funding through the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund, launched in 2019 and focuses on four major challenges to productivity.  These are biotic stress management, to address damage from other living organisms; efficient use of resources for crop production and livestock; resilience to climate variation; and digital connectivity.
Seed, plant and animal diversity (2.5)
The UK is working with a broad range of stakeholders to maintain the genetic diversity of seeds, plants and animals. To deliver this ambition the UK funds three genebank collections and four crop Genetic Improvement Networks (GINs). The GINs were renewed in 2018 and unlock the potential of the genetic material stored in genebanks by identifying beneficial traits that support productivity, sustainability, resilience and quality. GINs work with growers, seed companies and breeders to ensure that improved genetics are incorporated in elite UK crop varieties.

Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew’s global seed banking network, the Millennium Seed Bank Partnership (MSBP), is the largest ex situ plant conservation programme in the world with over 2 billion seeds. Its focus is plant life faced with the threat of extinction and plants of most use for the future; Kew’s 2016 ‘State of the World’s Plants’ report highlighted that 21% of global plant species are threatened with extinction. Seeds are conserved as an insurance against  the risk of extinction in their native habitat.  The project aims to collect and conserve seed from more than 350 species of Crop Wild Relative, facilitating their use in breeding  new and improved crops better adapted to climate change.
Scotland
A modern and successful Scotland, with abundant natural resources, does not tolerate anyone going hungry. The right to food is protected in human rights law.59 A whole systems approach is taken to tackle poor health outcomes, diet and food insecurity and the Good Food Nation approach links farms to plates. 
Food security and good nutrition (2.1, 2.2)
Data on household food insecurity in Scotland was published for the first time in 2017. This showed that 8% of adults experienced food insecurity in the previous 12 months, defined as worrying about running out of food due to lack of money or other resources. Household food insecurity was more prevalent amongst adults living in the most deprived areas and with the lowest incomes.60
Scotland’s Good Food Nation ambition is that by 2025 people from every walk of life will take pride and pleasure in, and benefit from, the food they produce, buy, cook, serve and eat every day. National and local government, civil society and communities are all working to tackle food insecurity. For example, the Scottish Welfare Fund provides a safety net for people on low incomes and a holistic approach to prevent future crises.
Community Food initiatives help people across Scotland access fresh, healthy food and develop the skills needed to prepare nutritious meals for themselves and their families. Regional networks in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Lanarkshire and the North East of Scotland help to link national priorities to local needs. A partnership approach to provide dignified access to food and trial new approaches to food insecurity in school holidays, through the Fair Food Fund, is underway. From summer 2019, smart payment cards will replace Healthy Start Food Vouchers to reduce stigma and increase choice for families in accessing good value healthy foods.
The Scottish Grocers Federation (SGF) Healthy Living Programme is helping to increase the range, quality and affordability of fresh produce and other healthier products in over 2,200 local convenience stores across Scotland, particularly in low income areas. The Programme has also reached over 10,000 young people, teachers and parents through their Big Breakfast and Healthy Living Days. These events link local retailers, schools and communities together by helping young people to learn about nutritious food.
The Data Picture: Food Insecurity
Coverage: Scotland
Data on food insecurity in Scotland was collected for the first time in 2017. The data show that the proportion of adults who at some point in the last 12 months were worried they would run out of food because of a lack of money or other resources is higher by 15 percentage points amongst adults living in the 20% most deprived areas compared with adults living in the 20% least deprived areas.

Oxfam Scotland, Child Poverty Action Group in Scotland, Nourish Scotland and Poverty Alliance, the project works to improve policy and practice in responding to food insecurity by increasing access to cash entitlements and welfare rights advice.
A Healthier Future: Scotland’s Diet and Health Weight Delivery Plan published in 2018 set out the ambition to halve childhood obesity by 2030 and significantly reduce diet-related health inequalities. With a focus on prevention, the plan sets out a wide range of action 
to make it easier for people to eat well and have a healthy weight, including: more support for children, young people and their families to achieve a healthy weight; additional investment in weight management services for people with, or at risk of, type 2 diabetes; and proposals to tackle junk food promotions and the marketing of unhealthy food.

Sustainable food production and farming  
(2.3, 2.4)
A range of plans and policies are in place to support sustainable agriculture, including the:
• Scottish Rural Development Programme, funding a mixture of farm and non-farm schemes to help achieve sustainable economic growth in rural areas;
• Knowledge Transfer and Innovation Fund implementing projects aimed at increasing farmers skills and knowledge; and 
• Agri-Environment Climate Scheme, offering  land-managers a five-year funded agreement and currently supporting more than 2,500 farming businesses across Scotland.
Sustaining new entrants into agriculture is crucial to the vitality, resilience and competitiveness of the agricultural sector. Scotland has introduced a Farming Opportunities for New Entrants (FONE) group and, by end 2018, FONE helped provide over 70 new land opportunities across over 5,000 hectares.61
Crofting contributes towards the social, economic and environmental sustainability of Scotland’s rural and remote rural areas. There are approximately 20,500 crofts and over 33,000 people live in crofting households.62 Scotland provides support to the environmental sustainability of agricultural practices and improve the livelihood of crofters.
Scotland has an active Women in Agriculture Taskforce, which seeks to promote women’s role in the industry with funding of £250,000 for 2018-20.
Wales
Food security and good nutrition (2.1, 2.2) 
Securing Good Nutrition  
Welsh initiatives to help improve nutrition include:
• The School Milk Subsidy Scheme which aims to increase consumption of milk and milk products by primary and secondary school children. 
• Free School Breakfasts. All children at primary schools maintained by a local authority can have a free breakfast at school, if provision is available.
• Free school meals are available to eligible pupils who attend school full-time.
Food poverty is one of five key priorities in the revised Child Poverty Strategy. Research shows that in Wales, some people are reporting food poverty: the  2016-17 National Survey for Wales reported that 1% of households had received food from a food bank in the last 12 months.63
In Wales, the Keep Wales Tidy programme works with ten Eco-Schools in deprived areas to develop food growing. This work has lasting important food poverty benefits and will encourage children of all attainment levels to develop practical skills
Activity snapshot:
The Welsh Food Poverty Network has been set up to bring together key charities and local authorities in Wales. The Network’s aim is to engage stakeholders in the food poverty agenda in Wales and provide learning about the activities of the Food Poverty Alliance Wales.
Diet and Healthy Weight 
The Public Health (Wales) Act 2017 has made a national obesity strategy a statutory requirement in Wales. In January 2019 the consultation ‘Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales’ was launched, setting out national ambitions to prevent and reduce obesity across Wales. The proposals include bringing forward legislation for the first time to help tackle obesity - this includes addressing price promotions, calorie labelling on foods eaten out of the home, and banning the sale of energy drinks to children. 

Resilient and productive agriculture, and 
sustainable and innovative food production  (2.3, 2.4) 
Agriculture is vital for Wales. Together, farm and common land accounts for 1.8 million hectares, 88% of the total (2.1 million hectares) land in Wales.64  The agricultural land in Wales is dominated by grass. 
Implementation of the Rural Development Plan 2014-20 and previous programmes in Wales, has maintained a focus on promoting agricultural productivity and promoting sustainable agriculture. Projects such as the Sustainable Production Grant and the Farm Business Grant directly sought to increase production and efficiency levels while encouraging greater levels of environmental performance through energy efficiency and low carbon technology and equipment. 
Farming Connect provides farm businesses with a range of services which aim to improve resilience and promote transformational change delivering a coordinated and integrated package of knowledge transfer, innovation and advisory services. It aims to improve resilience and promote transformational change in agriculture, forestry and rural communities, supporting a wide range of activities which improve competitiveness in the agriculture and forestry industries, safeguard and enhance the rural environment and foster competitive and sustainable rural businesses and thriving rural communities. Seed, plant and animal diversity (2.5) 
The Food Business Investment Scheme is designed to help primary producers of agricultural products in Wales to add value to their outputs by providing support to those businesses that do first and/or second stage processing activities. 
Wales has been at the forefront of the development of agri-environment schemes, such as the Glastir scheme, which seek to identify and deliver real environmental improvements as part of a ‘whole farm’ approach to sustainable agriculture. Through the Glastir scheme, Welsh farmers are encouraged to maintain traditional landscape features and habitats to benefit Wales’s native biodiversity. This activity also contributes to  the economic sustainability of farms and the wider rural community.
Northern Ireland
Northern Ireland is working to ensure those entering, and already in, the agricultural-food industry have the competency to take forward the sustainable development of the sector. Implementation of new action across key sectors of the Northern Irish economy will contribute to improved water quality and better nutrient management. 
In Northern Ireland, the Farm Business Improvement Scheme (FBIS) Capital scheme, launched in October 2016, is worth £40 million in its initial phase.  The Scheme is part of a package of measures aimed at the sustainable growth of the agriculture and horticulture industries. The scheme will prioritise investments aimed at improving on-farm efficiency  and environmental outcomes.
Activity snapshot: 
Belfast Food Network is delivering Zero Hunger – A Right to Quality, Affordable Food, with partners in Scotland and Wales, to strengthen existing networks, build knowledge, share learning and test methods for implementing a Right to Food approach.
Official control programmes are implemented to  ensure compliance with agricultural-food legislation in support of the competitiveness of the food and farming sectors. The Northern Ireland Regional  Food Programme (NIRFP) also supports initiatives  that raise the profile of quality regional food.  
The programme encourages collaboration within the local agricultural-food supply chain to develop and expand profitable and sustainable markets.
UK action around the world 
The UK is taking ambitious action to implement Goal 2 internationally and to integrate it with wider action across the Goals. Agriculture is critical for food and nutrition security, poverty reduction, growth, climate action and sustainable natural resource management. The UK has adopted an Agriculture Policy and Economic Development Strategy that set out how it will deliver decent jobs and incomes, good nutrition, women’s agri-tech empowerment, and climate resilience. Achieving this supports the world’s poorest and most vulnerable people with their food security, sustainable jobs and livelihoods, and boosts agricultural trade and investment, while ensuring that better nourished, more productive workforces overseas also benefit the UK. Results so far are mostly to be seen in inclusive growth, nutrition, and research: UK global agriculture programmes help reduce chronic hunger. 
The UK is also supporting the implementation of Goal 2 directly, such as through the Global Agriculture and Food Security Programme (GAFSP) which targets the poorest and most vulnerable. GAFSP has already supported over 9 million farmers, is expected to create 1.1 million jobs for youth, and leverage more funding from the private sector.65 Its current focus is on fragile poor geographies who have increasing numbers of the global hungry.
Securing good nutrition (2.1, 2.2)
Globally, 1 in 9 people (821 million) are chronically hungry.66 The UK’s Global Nutrition Strategy defines a high level of ambition to tackle this crisis.  
At the UK-hosted Nutrition for Growth Summit in 2013, the UK pledged over £1.25 billion of additional funding for nutrition-specific programmes and for programmes which increase the nutrition impact of work in related sectors (for example in water and sanitation, health, agriculture or social protection).  The UK also plans to reach 50 million people with nutrition interventions between 2015 and 2020, and is on track to meet these commitments. By 2018, the UK had reached 42 million children under five, adolescent girls, and women of childbearing age with relevant services.67 The UK is a global leader on tackling malnutrition, working both at country level and through the global Scaling Up Nutrition movement.
Activity snapshot: 
Mugu District, Nepal has an extremely high number of young children with acute malnutrition. PHASE Worldwide, a UK registered charity, with its partner NGO PHASE Nepal, is delivering a project to sustainably address the immediate and underlying causes of malnutrition among 1,600 ‘left behind’ children. The project will support 800 poor and vulnerable facilities to improve agricultural productivity and improve resilient practice of small-scale production. This will ensure access to safe and nutritious food all year round and reduce stunting and wasting in children.
Resilient, sustainable and productive agriculture (2.3, 2.4, 2.a)
With support from the UK, the international agriculture research system CGIAR (the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) is supporting crop productivity to help 30 million people exit poverty by 2022. In 2017 the CGIAR reported results which included 9.6 million households with improved rice varieties in Africa and 10 million households reached to date with biofortified crops.68
The UK’s support to AgResults, a £145 million multilateral initiative incentivising agri-tech investment in underserved markets, is delivering new evidence on how to develop and effectively scale new agriculture technologies. It has successfully stimulated market development for aflatoxin control agents in maize in Nigeria, leading to an annual net income increase for smallholders of US$318.69 Agricultural trade (2.b, 2.c)
Since 2015 the UK has continued to positively engage with multilateral reform to address restrictions and distortions in global agricultural markets. The new UK World Trade Organization goods schedule reflects zero export subsidies for agriculture. The UK also participates actively in multilateral initiatives to address food price volatility, such as the G20 Agricultural Market Information System.
Challenges and next steps
Significant work is already underway across the UK and there are a number of successes, but more needs to be done. This includes a renewed focus on Goal 2 and strong commitment to its delivery.
Whole-of-system food strategy
A National Food Strategy will be published to create an overarching, integrated strategy for England. This will address issues across the food system and ensure food manufacturing, production, and consumption play their part in producing good environmental and health outcomes.
Measuring and addressing household food insecurity 
The Food Standards Agency’s 2018 Food and You Survey of England, Wales and Northern Ireland found that:
• 80% of respondents lived in households with high food security;
• 10% in households classified as marginally food secure; and
• 10% reported living in household with low or very low food security. 
These proportions are at similar levels to the 2016 survey. However, figures are not at UK level. The Food Agriculture Organization (FAO) publishes household food security statistics at UK level, but due to the small sample size, these are presented as three-year averages. The FAO statistics show that the proportion of people experiencing severe food insecurity in the UK declined from 4% in 2014-16 to 3.4% in 2015-17.70
The UK government is fully committed to supporting vulnerable people and tackling poverty in all its forms (see Goal 1). In order to improve the understanding of  household food insecurity, the UK, has worked with food security experts to introduce a new set of food security questions into the Family Resources Survey from April 2019. These questions replicate the internationally recognised Adult Food Security Survey Module, first introduced by the United States Department of Agriculture, and will allow the UK to monitor the prevalence and severity of household  food insecurity from spring 2021
Small-scale agriculture
Many of those who work in the UK agricultural sector work on small-scale farms. However, relatively little is known about the characteristics of such farms as a group. In Scotland, over half of farms are below 10 hectares in size, and over 40,000 farms do not require the labour of one full-time worker.71 To create a vibrant tenanted sector, Scotland is undertaking research which aims to identify data gaps on small farms in existing datasets and literature; starting to explore small farmers as a social and economic group using qualitative research methods; and to provide recommendations and options for future research based on the project results. The challenges of European Union (EU) exit to sustainable farming and food production in Scotland are recognised. Scotland has proposed a period of stability and simplicity until 2024 to maintain certainty for farmers, crofters and land users.
Good nutrition
Internationally, the Global Nutrition Summit in 2020 will be a critical moment for the world to make new commitments capable of ensuring delivery of Goal 2.2 by 2030. The UK attaches the highest importance to the Summit and is working closely with Japan, as host, to prepare ambitious Summit outcomes. 

Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being
Ensure healthy lives and 
promote well-being for all at all ages
Summary
Health is one of the UK’s primary assets and the health and care system is playing its part to create a healthier, fairer and prosperous future through promoting health, happiness and the economy while preventing disease.
Despite the challenges of a growing, ageing and diversifying population, combined with the increasing burden of behavioural and lifestyle diseases, the UK maintains its historical pledge to a high-quality health service, free for all at the point of care. 
The UK is determined to harness the potential to transform health and the delivery of healthcare. This is not only for the benefit of the health of the nation but also as a world leader in emerging technologies, which have the potential to make a positive impact on health promotion, protection and treatment.
Prevention is better than cure. Making the healthy choice the easy choice is the key to longer and healthier lives for all. The UK approach includes a crucial focus on the prevention of illness as well as tackling inequalities to improve the health of the poorest fastest. 
The UK is a leading global health donor, committed to tackling disease, ensuring global health security and strengthening health systems to achieve quality health outcomes for all.
This chapter looks at the UK’s approach to delivering health and care for everyone and covers actions and recent progress under all nine Global Targets for Goal 3. Health services in the UK are devolved. Each of the four nations takes its own approach under its respective government and the chapter considers each nation’s work in turn.
Leave No One Behind examples:
• In England, the Prevention Vision launched in November 2018 set out how technology, workplace strategies and local communities can prevent the onset of ill health, support people with health issues and prevent worsening health. The vision is a call to action for every part of society. 
• In Scotland, a new Suicide Prevention Action Plan, Every Life Matters, was published in August 2018. This sets out ten measures to continue the strong decline in the rate of deaths by suicide, including a target to reduce the suicide rate by 20% by 2022 (from a 2017 baseline).
• In Wales, the 2025 Movement was formed in 2015 to support people living in areas of higher deprivation in North Wales who are likely to live 11 years less than those in other areas. Its mission is to end avoidable health inequalities by 2025. Membership has grown to over 300 organisations and people.
• In Northern Ireland, the Family Nurse Partnership (FNP) will break the cycle of disadvantage and transform children’s lives by raising the profile of nurse’s partnerships with teenage mums. The FNP significantly improves outcomes for parents from disadvantaged communities facing multiple adversities. 
• Globally, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a significant challenge that risks achievement not just of 
Goal 3 but Goals 1, 2, 6, 8 and 12 affecting areas such as poverty, food, water and sanitation. The UK vision for AMR by 2040 is supported by a five-year national action plan. AMR disproportionality impacts people in low- and middle-income countries which the UK supports through the Global AMR Innovation Fund. 

Action in the UK
All UK nations maintain their commitment to a National Health Service (NHS) free for all at the point of use, providing high-quality care based on clinical need. 
England
In England alone, NHS health checks have reached over six million people since 2013, making it one of the largest prevention programmes in the world, with people from the most disadvantaged communities benefitting the most.72
The NHS England Long-Term Plan, published on 7 January 2019, represents another step change in this ambition for preventative services, which, together with primary and community care are now at the centre of health and care service planning. 
These advances are underpinned by the UK’s largest funder of health and care research, the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR). NIHR people, programmes, centres of excellence and systems together represent the most integrated health research system in the world. Maternal, neonatal (Goals 3.1, 3.2)
In England, since 2010, stillbirths have fallen by 18.8%, neonatal mortality by 5.8% and maternal mortality by 8%.73 This achievement has been supported by an investment of nearly £40 million in England’s maternity services over this time. Since 2017 more than £9 million of additional funding is supporting activities such as safety training for multidisciplinary maternity teams. This supports the aim to reduce the rate of stillbirths, neonatal deaths, maternal deaths and brain injuries in babies soon after birth by 50% by 2025. 
However, to make real inroads towards this Global Target demands a real focus on populations most at risk across all four nations of the UK. Women from the poorest backgrounds and mothers from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) groups are at higher risk  of their baby dying in the womb or soon after birth.74  The number of deaths of children in England under 5 years per 1,000 live births has slightly risen from 4.2 in 
2015 to 4.4 in 2016, following a steady decline from 
2005 to 2015.75
The Data Picture: Maternal mortality rate
Coverage: UK
The UK maternal mortality rate decreased between 2003-05 and 2012-14 but in recent years it has risen again from 8.5 (2012-14) to 9.8 (2014-16) per 100,000 maternities. Mothers who identified as black had a higher mortality rate (39.7 per 100,000 maternities in 2014-16) compared to other ethnicities.

Sexual and reproductive health (3.7) In England, there is an established network of open access sexual health services, as part of the universal service offered by the NHS. There were 1.85 million contacts with dedicated sexual and reproductive health services in England in 2017/18. This represented a decrease of 9.1% on the number of contacts in 2015/16 (2.03 million).76
As part of preventive action against cancer, the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccine programme is being expanded to include 12 and 13-year-old boys (year 8) from academic year 2019/20.
Women in England can easily access abortions free of charge. The long-term trend in the rate of abortions has declined in England and Wales, compared to 2007, and in 2017 it was 16.7 per 1,000 resident women. However, this is a slight increase from the 2015 rate of 
16.0 per 1,000.77
Communicable diseases (3.3, 3.6, 3.8)
England’s commitment to end new transmissions of HIV by 2030 has so far seen a 28% reduction in new incidences in England since 2015, with 3,973 new incidences in 2017 compared to 5,485 in 2015.78
After clean water, vaccination is the most effective public health intervention that protects children and adults against diseases and the World Health Organization (WHO) has included vaccine hesitancy as one of their ten threats to global health in 2019. 
Uptake is high for most childhood vaccination programmes across the UK, including MenB (92.9%), MMR (91.7%) and rotavirus (90.6%), and work is underway to increase this.79 The flu vaccine is freely available to those aged six months to 65 years in clinical risk groups, pregnant woman and carers and to everyone aged 65 and over. As part of the extension of the national flu immunisation programme to children, all those from ages 2 to 9 were offered flu vaccination from autumn 2019, to provide protection and reduce onward transmission. 
Preventing infection, through vaccination and good Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) practice, is a key component of tackling one of the biggest threats facing the world’s population: antimicrobial resistance. There has been significant progress to reduce the inappropriate use of antimicrobials in recent years: in the UK total antibiotic use in humans has reduced by more than 7% from 2014-2017 and the sales of antibiotics for use in food-producing animals dropped 40% in the same time period.80
Healthy and safe environment (3.6, 3.9)
The UK-wide Clean Air Strategy sets out ambitious plans to address one of the biggest threats to public health in the UK. In 2017, 5.1% of adult deaths in England were attributed to particulate air pollution.81 The Strategy builds on a commitment to halve the number of people living in areas breaching WHO guidelines on particulate matter by 2025. 
The safety of those travelling on UK roads is paramount. UK roads are among the world’s safest, and there remains a commitment to invest both in routine maintenance and in technologies or upgrades that maintain and improve the safety record of the UK’s road networks. For Great Britain, in 2017, there were 1,793 reported road deaths, similar to the level seen since 2012, and 170,993 overall road traffic casualties, a decrease of 8% compared to 2015.82

Healthy minds, bodies and lifestyles (3.4, 3.5, 3.8) The risk of cardiovascular disease increases with age. In England and Wales, the mortality rate attributed to cardiovascular disease in 65 to 69 -year- olds was 266 persons per 100,000 population in 2017, a slight decrease from the rate in 2015 (272 per 100,000). Action is being taken to address cardiovascular diseases and other non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and cancer.83
At the forefront of this drive is the development of Genomics. This marks the age of precision medicine and has huge implications for the understanding and treatment of rare diseases, cancer and infections. The UK will maintain its commitment to the development of this cutting-edge technology with its potential to significantly improve the quality of human lives.

This project is part of England’s world-leading commitment to 1 million genomes and to analyse 5 million genomes. A National Genomic Healthcare Strategy will be published, detailing how the NHS will provide genomics as part of routine care and support research for improved healthcare.
In England, childhood obesity is a real concern. In 2015/16 22.1% of reception children were overweight or obese. In 2017/18 this increased to 22.4%.85 Action to address this is covered in Goal 2. 
The Data Picture: Obesity prevalence rate 
Coverage: England
For 4-5-year olds in 2017/18, obesity prevalence was over twice as high in the most deprived areas (12.8%) than least deprived (5.7%). Between 2006/07 and 2017/18 the gap between obesity prevalence for the most and least deprived areas increased by 1.6 percentage points due to obesity prevalence remaining similar in the most deprived areas and reducing in the least deprived.

In England, over 1 million people are accessing Improving Access to Psychological Therapies services each year.87 A £15 million investment is being made to ensure at least 1 million people are trained in basic mental health first aid skills. The Time to Change initiative is reducing mental health illness stigma and utilising technology to develop digital tools to maintain good mental health. These will help predict future behaviour, such as risk of self-harm or suicide. 
The Five Year Forward View for Mental Health sets a commitment to reduce suicides in England by 10% by 2020/21, compared to 2015. Between 2015 and 2017, the number of suicides in England reduced by more than 7% from 4,820 to 4,451,88 showing good progress towards achieving the target. All areas in England now have a multi-agency suicide prevention plan in place. This is supported by a £25 million investment. The National Suicide Prevention Strategy highlights men as a high-risk group and a proportion of the £25 million funding will test different approaches to reaching men in local communities.

Maternal mental health is also a priority, with maternal suicide the leading cause of direct deaths occurring within a year of pregnancy from 2014-16.89 £365 million will be invested in perinatal mental health services from 2015 to 2020. Progress in 2017/2018 has exceeded expectations more than three-fold, with 7,000 more women accessing services by March 2018 against a target of 2,000.90
Scotland
Increased well-being is at the heart of Scotland’s National Performance Framework. It is a necessity to close the gap between the health of the wealthiest and poorest communities to deliver an overall improvement in population health. While many of the targets are met in Scotland, there is a long-term strategic approach underpinning the challenges, focussing on excellent healthcare services and preventative population health approaches.
Prevention and treatment (3.3, 3,4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7)
Public health challenges in Scotland include smoking, alcohol, drugs and diet (link to Goal 2), and action is being taken to tackle these. 
Building on previous work and policy initiatives such as minimum unit pricing for alcohol, the Alcohol Framework 2018: Preventing Harm has a key focus on reducing health inequalities.
A five-year plan was published in June 2018 with an ambition to create a tobacco-free generation by reducing smoking rates to 5% or less by 2034.
Scotland is also committed to preventing and reducing the impact of Adverse Child Experiences (ACEs) and supporting resilience to overcome adversity.
An expert group will examine the key drivers of drugsrelated deaths and advise on what further measures could help save lives and reduce harm. 
The Data Picture:  
Drug-related deaths

Global Target 3.5 highlights the need to strengthen the prevention and treatment of substance abuse. In 2017, 934 drug-related deaths were registered in Scotland in 2017, the highest since records began in 1996, and more than double the 455 deaths in 2007. Males accounted for 70% of the drug-related deaths in 2017.

Global Target 3.6 (Indicator 3.6.1) aims to halve the number of global deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents. The number of deaths from road accidents, across all modes of transport, declined by 13% between 2015 (168) and 2017 (146). Modes with the largest share of deaths in 2017 were car (65 deaths) and pedestrians (38 deaths).

Sexual and reproductive health (3.7)
It is widely recognised that short inter-pregnancy intervals of less than 12 months are associated with an increased risk of obstetric and neonatal complications including preterm birth, stillbirth and neonatal death. The provision of post-partum contraception (PPC) has therefore been a policy priority for the Scottish Government for some time. It is set out in the 
Refreshed Maternity Framework (2011), the Sexual 
Health and Blood Borne Virus Framework Update (2015) and the Pregnancy and Parenthood in Young People Strategy (2016). 
The provision of long acting reversible contraception (LARC) methods as part of PPC is particularly key, as these provide a high level of efficacy and are independent of adherence for their effectiveness. However, it is essential that women are always offered 
LARC as a choice within a range of methods (if any 
is desired) so that they remain in control of their own reproductive health.
Mental well-being
There has been a steady and significant increase in the proportion of adults who have two or more symptoms of depression (8% in 2010/11 to 11% in 2016/17).91 Since 2002, the rate of suicide has generally been on a downward trend to 12.8 deaths per 100,000 population in 2017. The 2017 male suicide rate of 19.9 per 100,000 was over three times that for females (5.7 per 100,000). There is a strong relationship between deprivation and suicide, with the rates of suicide in the most deprived 10% of Scotland more than two and half times greater than the least deprived 10% (21.9 per 100,000 compared to 7.6 per 100,000) in the 2013-17 period.92
Scotland’s Mental Health Strategy 2017-2027 sets out actions to tackle poor mental health for people to get the right help at the right time, expect recovery and fully enjoy their rights free from stigma. The delivery of a package of support in schools, colleges and communities is underway that will see new school nurses and counsellors and bespoke support for new and expectant mothers.
A Suicide Prevention Action Plan: Every Life Matters sets out further measures to continue the decline in suicides, with a target to reduce the rate by 20% by 2022 (from 2017 baseline).
Activity snapshot: 
Glasgow City Health and Social Care partnership are pursuing proposals to pilot a safer drug consumption facility in the city centre – designed for an estimated 400-500 people who inject publicly and experience high levels of harm. The facility is expected to reduce the risk of further outbreaks of blood-borne viruses.
Wales
In Wales, the ability to live healthy lives is central to overall well-being for Welsh people. It filters through all other inter-connected aspects of people’s lives, including the ways in which people grow, learn, work, interact and age. 
The complex and interrelated causes of health inequalities need a combination of approaches to tackle them. Action on inequalities is a key feature of a broad range of policies and programmes, including 

upstream actions to help people cope, targeting actions to address unhealthy behaviours, and improving access to healthcare. 
Good health and well-being depend on more than provision of good health services. This principle is driven forward through Wales’s long-term plan for health and social care, ‘A Healthier Wales’, a long-term future vision of a whole-system approach to health and social care, including greater emphasis on health promotion and preventative approaches. 
Most adults report good overall health, with 70% saying they were in ‘good’ or ‘very good’ health in the National Survey for Wales 2017-18.93
The Data Picture: Life Expectancy
Coverage: Wales
Life expectancy has risen by 2.8 years for men and 2.2 years for women since the period 200103, with the gap between male and female life expectancy closing. A girl born in Wales between 2014 and 2016 could expect to live to her 82nd birthday while a boy could expect to reach his 78th.

Teenage Conceptions (3.7)
Teenage conceptions reached a record low in Wales in 2016 and have fallen dramatically since 2008. The rate for those aged under 18 has more than halved over the last decade94 to 24.3 in 2015 and 20.2 women under 
18 in 2017.95
Well-Being and Healthy behaviours (3.4, 3.5)
Smoking rates96 and the percentage of people consuming excess alcohol in Wales have both reduced over time. Smoking-attributable mortality has also decreased. However, tobacco is the leading single cause of premature death in Wales and a major contributor to health inequalities, at around one in every six of all deaths in people aged 35 and over.97 In order to help smokers give up, all smoking cessation services are accessed via a single contact point, ‘Help Me Quit’.
The Data Picture:  
Estimated Smoking Prevalence 
(Persons aged 16+)
Coverage: Wales
The percentage of adults who self-reported smoking decreased steadily from 26.4% in 2003/04 to 19.4% in 2015. There was little change in smoking rates between 2016-17 and 2017-18.1

National Survey for Wales 
In 2017, a reduction in the number of adults drinking over the weekly guidelines was reported, at 18%, down from 20% in 2016.98 There were 185 deaths from drug misuse in 2017, a decrease of 4% from 2016.99 Prevention is at the heart of the Welsh substance misuse strategy ‘Working Together to Reduce Harm’. The services on offer are aimed at all individuals and families, particularly those who are most disadvantaged.
DAN 24: Wales Drug and Alcohol Helpline is a free and bilingual telephone helpline providing a single point of contact for anyone in Wales wanting further information and / or help relating to drugs and / or alcohol. The service is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and assists individuals, their families, carers, and support workers within the drug and alcohol field to access appropriate local and regional services.
One of the key achievements for Wales is the passing of the Public Health (Minimum Price for Alcohol) (Wales) Act 2018. Minimum pricing is a targeted measure, which aims to reduce hazardous and harmful levels of drinking. 
Results from the first Welsh Adverse Childhood 
Experiences (ACEs) study show that suffering four or more harmful experiences in childhood increases the chances of high-risk drinking in adulthood by four times, being a smoker by six times and being involved in violence in the last year by around 14 times.100 The Welsh Government has therefore prioritised the tackling of ACEs and has supported Cymru Well Wales in establishing an ACE Support Hub to tackle the negative impacts of Adverse Childhood Experiences.101
Obesity is a leading public health concern in Wales. Almost a quarter of adults and 12.4% of children are obese.102 The causes of obesity are complex and personal. ‘Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales’ will set out Wales’s ambitions to prevent and reduce obesity in Wales, with a focus on leadership, creating healthy environments and settings, and providing the opportunities and inspiring people to achieve and maintain a healthy body weight. 
In 2016-17, there were 8,723 admissions to mental health facilities in Wales, a decrease of 6% from 2015-16.103 ‘Together for Mental Health’ strategy aims to improve the mental health of everyone in Wales and the lives of people using mental health services, and their carers and their families, through a range of support, from helping people to feel better and manage their own mental health to services for people with severe, long-lasting mental illness.
Air Pollution Mortality (3.9)
A 2017 report published by Public Health Wales estimated the equivalent of 1,604 deaths of people aged 30+years was attributable to PM2.5 and an estimated equivalent of 1,108 deaths to NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) each year.104 Wales has taken a proactive approach to tackling air quality and the main air pollutants hazardous to health have been steadily declining since the 1990s.105
Road Safety (3.6)
Wales provides strategic direction and funding to partners to deliver education and engineering road safety interventions across Wales through the Road Safety Capital & Revenue Grants, and funding to Trunk Road Agents. There has been good progress made against Wales’s targets for casualty reduction in the whole population and amongst young people, with a 
25% reduction for all people killed or seriously injured in road traffic accidents and a 41% reduction in young people compared with the 2004-2008 average.106 Northern Ireland
Northern Ireland has put in place a wide range of programmes, information and support mechanisms to underpin delivery of health and well-being outcomes. In addition, Northern Ireland is working together with communities to create the conditions to support improved health and encourage healthier choices. 
In Northern Ireland, resources continue to be devoted to ensuring that initiatives and actions taken result in meaningful improvements for people in terms of their health and well-being, life expectancy and quality of their healthcare experience. An example is in relation to smoking cessation, obesity prevention, alcohol and drugs misuse and early treatment of stroke patients. 
Progress towards the overall Goal of ‘Good Health and Well-being’ reflects the fact that many of the influences on health and well-being are inter-dependent and require significant focus over an extended period of time. This is to deliver clear, positive and measurable change. Just as changes in Healthy Life Expectancy at birth are expected to be gradual, reducing the Healthy Life Expectancy gap between the most and least deprived is a significant challenge which requires sustained collaboration both at regional and local levels.
Belfast Healthy Cities delivers the ‘Health Literacy Programme’. The programme aims to ensure that capacity-building resources are available to strengthen health literacy within Belfast and Northern Ireland by delivering oneday Health Literacy Communication Training to interested stakeholder groups and health professionals.
Nursing Now Northern Ireland was launched in January 2019. It aims to improve health by raising the profile and status of nursing worldwide. This is to ensure Northern Ireland-based nurses are well-placed to tackle the health challenges of the 21st century.
In Northern Ireland, while it is encouraging to see positive change in preventable mortality and confidence of older populations (measured using selfefficacy), progress is slower on lowering the proportion of the population with possible mental health problems and on healthy life expectancy, including narrowing the deprivation gap. 
Activity snapshot: 
Business in the Community Northern Ireland delivers a well-being programme to support local businesses in tackling key issues across physical and mental health including key societal issues such as obesity, drugs and alcohol awareness and stress at work.
For individuals, families and communities to take greater control over their lives and be enabled and supported in leading healthy, active lives, collaboration is needed across government and with local authorities, the community and voluntary sector, private businesses and other organisations and delivery partners to address the factors which impact on health and wellbeing. In Northern Ireland the focus is to improve healthy life expectancy and reduce preventable deaths; to reduce health inequalities; to improve the quality of the healthcare experience; and to improve mental health.
Work remains to build on successes and to address those indicators where no change is identified at present, or where measurement data is being developed.

UK action around the world
The UK is the second largest global health donor and is committed to supporting progress globally towards Goal 3.107 This includes tackling diseases, such as HIV/
AIDS, Tuberculosis (TB), malaria and the Neglected Tropical Diseases; ensuring global health security through supporting countries to prevent, identify and manage disease outbreaks and to minimise the risk of AMR; and strengthening health systems to ensure that everyone, even the most disadvantaged, has access to quality essential health services, without risk of financial hardship.
Communicable diseases (3.3)
To tackle specific diseases, the UK is investing up to 
£1.2 billion (2016-2019) in the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria. The Fund ensured 17.5 million people received antiretroviral therapy for HIV and 197 million mosquito nets were distributed for malaria in 2017.108 The UK also delivered 144 million treatments to prevent and treat neglected tropical diseases in 2017109  and is the largest funder of Gavi,110 the Vaccine Alliance, which is on track to vaccinate 300 million children globally between 2016 and 2020. So far, in 2016 and 2017, 127 million children have been vaccinated.111
Activity snapshot: 
In 2017, the International HIV/AIDS Alliance collectively provided or linked nearly 1.6 million adults, adolescents and children to HIV treatment, care and support and reached nearly 2 million people with integrated HIV and sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) services to marginalised groups. 
The UK has been at the forefront of responding to global health threats. Since responding to the West Africa Ebola outbreak, the UK has supported regional preparedness in over 20 countries through the WHO Africa regional office. The UK Public Health Rapid Support Team responds to disease outbreaks, conducts research and builds capacity. The UK, through its Tackling Deadly Diseases in Africa Programme (£95 million), is supporting the WHO and international development company DAI to enhance country capabilities to prevent, detect and respond to deadly diseases in 47 countries, including in the Sahel.
Non-communicable diseases, healthy and safe environments (3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.9, 3.a)
The UK hosted the first Global Ministerial Mental Health Summit in 2018 and its Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) 2030 project supports tobacco control in 15 countries. The UK works closely with the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction and hosts the World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centre for public health management of Chemical Exposures. 
Road crashes are the biggest killer of 5 to 29-year-olds globally. The UK has funded the Global Road Safety Facility since 2013, contributing £4 million between 2015-2017 and, in 2018, committing £10.6 million more by 2022.112 Through this work, 2,159 road deaths and injuries were avoided in 2017.113 Funding also contributed to the development of the Latin American Road Safety Observatory and the inception of an African Road Safety Observatory.
Activity snapshot: 
Plan International UK have reached more than 500,000 young people in 7 countries through the Young Health Programme, a partnership with AstraZeneca. The programme tackles the significant threat of non-communicable diseases by aiming to prevent or reduce the practice of associated risk behaviours among young people such as use of tobacco, harmful use of alcohol, unhealthy diets and physical inactivity.
Capacity building and research and development 
(3.b, 3.c, 3.d)
The UK invests over £1 billion in research, which underpins Goal 3, including product development for vaccines, medicines and other tools to tackle diseases, and applied health research to improve health outcomes in the poorest countries. 
One example of UK-funded research specific to AMR is the £50 million Global AMR Innovation Fund (GAMRIF) that supports early-stage innovative research in underfunded areas of AMR research and development for the benefit of people in low- and middleincome countries. GAMRIF works with researchers, governments and industry to fund research into potential future innovations to tackle AMR throughout the world. This includes innovation in vaccines, alternatives to traditional antibiotics, and diagnostics.
The Fleming Fund is a £265 million UK aid investment supporting the generation and use of AMR data in low- and middle-income countries. It builds partnerships and leverages UK and international expertise to improve laboratory capacity and surveillance, helping countries to tackle this critical issue.
Maternal, child, and sexual and reproductive health (3.1, 3.2, 3.7)
On maternal and child health, the UK invested approximately £1 billion a year across bilateral programmes and multilateral organisations from  2014-17.114 In 2017, the UK invested in the Global Financing Facility to increase financing of evidencebased maternal and child health interventions in 27 countries.
The UK is a global leader on sexual and reproductive health, co-hosted the 2017 Family Planning Summit, and is investing an average of £225 million per year in voluntary family planning from 2017-2022. Between April 2017 and March 2018, 14 million women and girls were reached with voluntary modern contraception, preventing 4.4 million unintended pregnancies, 1.2 million unsafe abortions and saving 4,900 women’s lives.115
Universal health coverage (3.8)
The UK’s health systems strengthening work ranges from working directly with partner governments to strengthen elements of their health services, such as the provision of good nutrition, water and sanitation and funding the WHO across their work and in their drive to achieve Universal Health Coverage. 
Activity snapshot: 
Healthcare UK is investing £1 million in a Healthcare Artificial Intelligence Catalyst (HAIC) which will bring some of the best AI healthcare companies and organisations to work with ongoing health programmes in India, including Ayushman Bharat. The solutions will focus on AI technology that can support the Indian healthcare system in diagnosing life-threatening or debilitating conditions early as a critical step towards treating or managing them.
Challenges and next steps
Tackling childhood obesity 
Obesity is a leading public health concern in the UK. The burden of childhood obesity is greatest in the most deprived areas, with children growing up in low-income households more than twice as likely to be obese than those in higher-income households. Children from black and minority ethnic families are also more likely than children from white families to be overweight or obese and this inequality gap is increasing.116
The causes of obesity are complex. All sectors have a part to play in making food and drink healthier and supporting healthier choices for children. England’s Childhood Obesity Plan sets an ambition to halve childhood obesity and significantly reduce the gap in obesity between children from the most and least deprived areas by 2030. Wales’s Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales also sets out an ambition to prevent and reduce obesity, with a focus on leadership, creating healthy environments and settings, and providing the opportunities and inspiring people to achieve and maintain a healthy body weight.
Evaluating mental health
Recent increases in funding and action to tackle poor mental health across the UK will require good evaluation to understand which interventions have the biggest impact. One commitment in Scotland’s Mental Health Strategy is to develop a mental health strategy data framework, recognising that good mental health is not the sole preserve of health services, or even public services. The framework comprises two elements: a mental health quality indicator profile to illustrate the quality of services; and a mental health population framework to provide an accessible overview for those seeking to understand Scotland’s mental health and well-being at the population level. A full progress review of the Mental Health Strategy will be held in 2022 to ensure that lessons are learnt from actions to that point.
Addressing global health security
AMR threatens the achievement of many of the Goals. The UK has played a leading role in raising the profile of this issue globally and strengthening the level of international co-ordination. A review commissioned by the UK and prepared by former World Bank Chief Economist Lord O’Neill had global impact in highlighting the risks of AMR, both to lives and to the economy. It reported that drug-resistant infections are estimated to contribute to over two thousand deaths in the UK each year and are predicted to cause 10 million deaths per year globally by 2050 (O’Neill Review). A significant contributor to AMR-related deaths is multidrug or rifampicin-resistant TB, which in 2016 caused an estimated 240,000 deaths.117
With the publication of a 20-year vision for AMR in 2019, the UK has committed to take a long-term view as to how to sustain action and contribute to the global effort to contain and control resistance, working with partners across all sectors. The UK must continue to display strong leadership and work to ensure AMR is at the top of global agendas, whilst supporting other countries in their efforts to combat this threat. 

Goal 4: Quality Education
Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all
Summary
Education transforms lives. Every generation should have better access to a good education than the last, while ensuring that no one is left behind. 
In the UK, standards are high and rising, producing good levels of literacy and numeracy. Education providers have significant levels of accountability and autonomy and well-developed curricula. National testing systems (in England, Wales and Northern Ireland), alongside data monitoring and tracking, are informing the development of innovative programmes and policies. However, much more needs to be done to close the attainment gap between disadvantaged young people and adults and their more affluent peers. The UK also needs to raise the quality and perception of technical education to match academic education to ensure the economy has a skilled workforce to support it in the future. This needs to be done while maintaining an engaged and effective teaching workforce. 
Inclusivity is at the heart of education policy and the UK is committed to bringing out the full potential of all learners of all ages across the UK. Overseas, the UK is a world leader in helping tackle extreme poverty through education and is steadfast in its efforts to reach the most marginalised groups. 
This chapter explores the UK’s approach to delivering education and opportunities for all and covers actions and recent progress under all ten Global Goal 4 Targets. Education in the UK is devolved, with each of the four nations taking its own approach under its respective government. To reflect this, the chapter considers each nation’s work in turn.
Leave No One Behind examples:
• In England, the 2017 Social Mobility plan is helping to build an inclusive education system, with social mobility at its heart. The plan commits to raising standards for all and leaving no community behind, targeting efforts and resources at the people and places that need it most. 
• Opportunity Areas will receive an additional £72 million over three years to support local partnerships to address stubborn local challenges stopping people from fulfilling their potential and begin sustainable, long-term change.
• The Scottish Attainment Challenge launched in 2015, and supported by £750 million Attainment Scotland Fund, has a particular focus on closing the poverty-related attainment gap and supporting pupils in local authority areas with the highest concentrations of deprivation. 
• In Wales, the way children and young people (aged 0 to 25 years) with additional learning needs are supported is being transformed. This includes legislative reform, workforce development, a focus on person centred practice and a shift in culture.
• In Northern Ireland, the Sure Start programme provides targeted support to around 39,000 children 4 years old or under (and their families) to promote the physical, intellectual, social and emotional development of children in areas of greatest disadvantage. 

Action in the UK
England
Quality Primary and Secondary Education  
(4.1, 4.6)
All school-age children have access to a free education, provided in a variety of settings, with 85% of schools in England rated ‘Good’ or ‘Outstanding’ by Ofsted as at December 2018, compared to 82% in August 2015 and 68% in August 2010.118 In November 2017, over 95% of full-time equivalent teachers in all state-funded schools in England had Qualified Teacher Status.119
England achieved its highest ever score in reading in 2016120, moving from joint 10th in the previous survey in 2011121 to joint 8th in the most recent Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) rankings. Pupils in England also performed, on average, significantly above the international mean in maths and science in the most recent Trends in International 
Maths and Science Study (TIMSS) 2015.122
Early Years and childcare (4.2) 
Early years education and childcare play an important role in tackling social disadvantage and narrowing gaps in later attainment. A 2018 analysis by the Education Policy Institute showed that, on average, disadvantaged children are four months behind at age 5. That grows by an additional five months by age 11, and a further nine months by age 16.123 Universal early education is addressing this by giving children in England 15 hours a week of free early years education for 38 weeks after their third birthday, or second birthday for disadvantaged children. Since 2017, working families with three to four-year-olds have been eligible for an additional 15 hours a week of free childcare on top of the universal entitlement. These policies are delivering near universal participation in organised education one year before the official primary school entry age.124

The Data Picture: Phonics 
Coverage: England
The Phonics screening check is identifying five and six-year-olds who need extra help with reading. In 2018, 38,000 more Year 1 pupils in England met the expected standard compared to 2015. This represented 82% of pupils meeting the standard, compared to 77% in 2015 and 58% in 2012. Since 2012, a greater proportion of girls than boys have achieved the expected standard.

Activity Snapshot:
A £4 million Education Endowment Foundation scheme will trial projects in England to provide tools and advice to parents to support children’s early language and reading at home. The trials range from home visits, to a texting initiative to nudge parents to undertake more activities that develop reading, arithmetic and emotional development. Alongside this, an £8.5 million programme has opened for local authorities to fund projects to improve early language and literacy development for disadvantaged children.
Technical, Further and Higher Education (4.3)
The UK government provides equal access to affordable and quality technical, vocational and tertiary education, including to its world-class universities. As of OctoberDecember 2018, an estimated 11.3% of 16 to 24-yearolds were not in education, employment or training in England, a slight though not statistically significant decrease, from 11.6% in the same period of 2015.125 From August 2019, Higher Education providers will be required to publish disaggregated student application and performance data to highlight which institutions need to widen access and improve outcomes for all their students. 
The Data Picture: Entry to Higher 
Education (HE)
Coverage: England
In 2018, 20.2% of 18-year olds from the most disadvantaged areas entered full time HE, an increase from 13.5% in 2010 and 18.0% in 2015. The participation of local areas (POLAR) classification sorts local areas into five groups based on the proportion of 18-year olds who enter HE.

Apprenticeships are a key pillar of a skilled workforce. Since May 2015, over 1.7 million apprenticeships have been taken up in England.126 An apprenticeship reform programme has seen employers with an annual pay bill of £3 million or more levied 0.5% of that bill to fund quality apprenticeship training and deepen employer engagement in this valuable area. 
In England, employer-designed T Level programmes will be a new gold standard in technical excellence and a high-quality alternative to academic education. An additional £500 million per year will be invested in T Levels, once they are fully rolled out in 2020. 
Activity Snapshot:
Business in the Community Business Class brings together businesses and schools strategic partnerships. Over the past ten years, almost 29,000 business volunteers from over 1000 businesses have reached over 277,000 young people. Businesses and schools have worked together on employability and enterprise, supporting school leaders, curriculum projects and wider community issues.
Skills for decent work (4.4, 4.6)
Lifelong learning is essential to future-proof the economy. Since 2015, advanced learner loans (ALLs) have helped adult learners in England undertake qualifications. In the academic year 2017/18, 98,900 learners benefitted from ALL payments, worth £217 million.127 A £100 million adult National Retraining Scheme will start in 2019, designed to give every worker the opportunity to upskill or retrain.
The Adult Education Budget (AEB) supports adults in England who have not achieved secondary schoollevel English and Maths qualifications. It helps them to overcome barriers to education or training; such as childcare and transport costs; or any reasonable adjustments for those with a learning difficulty or disability. 
Activity Snapshot:
Jobcentre Plus Work Coaches are providing free personalised employment support for benefit claimants. They can help claimants identify suitable local skills and training opportunities, such as vocational courses, traineeships and basic maths and English courses offered by local colleges and training providers.
Inclusive Education (4.3, 4.5) 
The Children and Families Act 2014 sets out a presumption of mainstream education for pupils in England with special educational needs and disability. This enables children and young people, no matter their needs, to develop the social skills they will need to lead happy and fulfilled lives and succeed in future education and employment.
Activity Snapshot:
Send My Friend to School is a UK civil society coalition of international development nongovernmental organisations (NGOs), teachers unions and charities. The project is a Goal 4 awareness-raising campaign to demand quality education for all children across the globe. Over 200,000 young people from UK schools and youth groups get involved each year campaigning for the right to education of all children.
Civil society organisations are delivering programmes to tackle homophobic, biphobic, and transphobic bullying in schools throughout England and, between 2016-19, completed interventions in 1,200 schools.128
The Data Picture: Participation in education
Coverage: England
Participation rates in adult education do not differ significantly depending on the sex of a respondent, with 11.2% of women and 9.6% of men undertaking formal learning in the 12 months before a 2016 survey. However, respondents who were disabled and/or had work-limiting disabilities were less likely to have participated in formal education than respondents who did not have a disability (7.5% compared to 12.0%).

Several programmes in England aim to increase girls’ engagement in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) subjects. In 2018, 27.1% of A-Level entries by girls were in STEM subjects, an increase of 3.3 percentage points since 2015.129 STEM ambassadors are raising awareness of the range of careers that STEM qualifications offer.
Teaching the Goals (4.7)
In England, the national curriculum provides teachers with the opportunity to teach pupils about Global Goal topics which teachers are free to expand on if they choose. For example, the Citizenship curriculum teaches pupils about the rule of law, justice system and how laws are shaped and enforced. Citizenship also teaches about the diverse national, regional, religious and ethnic identities in the UK and the need for mutual respect and understanding. The British Council is helping to create a school resource, focussed on Goal 4.7, designed to teach students across the UK about the Goals. 
Activity snapshot:
• Barrowford Primary School in Lancashire is teaching its pupils about the Goals through the primary national curriculum. Pupils hold half termly exhibition evenings to display their knowledge of the Goals, to raise awareness of them and to change the habits of community members.
• The University of Warwick has developed an undergraduate degree in Global Sustainable Development - the first course of its kind - and encourages students to run sustainability campaigns on campus.
• Secondary Geography trainee teachers at the University of Worcester are introduced to the Goals early in their course with a taught session exploring the World’s Largest Lesson. They choose a Goal to focus on in their inaugural lesson and deliver an ‘Environment Day’ at a local secondary school. Trainees plan lessons introducing pupils to the Goals in their entirety and a closer look at eight specific Goals.
Effective learning environments (4.a)
In England, the Keeping Children Safe in Education guidance requires all schools to create safe and accessible learning environments. Schools are contractually obliged to ensure building designs do not disadvantage pupils with disabilities, in terms of access to teaching, learning and social spaces. 
To tackle the impact that the costs of period products can have on education, it was announced in April 2019 that all primary and secondary school pupils and college students in England will have access to free period products in their place of study. 
Scotland
Scotland is focussed on closing the poverty-related attainment gap and has a strong Leave No One Behind approach to this Goal.
Early learning through to school years (4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 4.6, 4.7)
Scotland has near universal uptake of funded places of early learning and childcare (99% in 2017)130 and Goal 1 sets out Scotland’s commitment to doubling the provision to 1,140 hours per year by August 2020. 
The Children and Young People Improvement Collaborative has been set up to make early years, health, family services and schools more effective and responsive in tackling inequality and improving children’s outcomes.
Through the Curriculum for Excellence, children and young people in Scotland are supported to become successful learners, confident individuals, responsible citizens and effective contributors to society.
An attainment gap still exists between children from Scotland’s most and least deprived areas although this is narrowing. For example, in 2009-10, the gap between the proportion of school leavers from the most and least deprived areas with one pass or more at Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework level 4 or better was 11.3 percentage points. By 201718 this had narrowed to 6.1 percentage points.131 Similarly, at SCQF level 5 or better the gap narrowed from 33.3 percentage points to 20.3 percentage points whilst at SCQF level 6 or better it narrowed from 45.6 percentage points to 37.4 percentage points.132
There is also a gap in attainment between boys and girls: in 2017-18 69% of female school leavers achieved SCQF level 6 or better, compared to 56% of male school leavers.133
The National Improvement Framework was introduced in January 2016 and brings together a comprehensive range of performance data and information to support targeted improvement activity across Scottish education.
Children in schools across Scotland are entitled to study Learning for Sustainability as part of the Curriculum. This aims to provide pupils with the skills, knowledge and values to live socially, economically and environmentally sustainable lives in a global society. The Scottish Government will publish an action plan to further promote Learning for Sustainability in June 2019. 
‘Respect for All: The National Approach to Anti-bullying for Scotland’s Children and Young People’ was updated in November 2017. This guidance is for everyone working with children and young people and provides a holistic approach to anti-bullying.
Guidance is in place to bridge the gap between legislation, policy and day-to-day experience, ensuring that children and young people have equitable access to a quality education which meets their needs and helps them achieve their full potential.
Activity Snapshot:
My Rights My Say service is a partnership between Children in Scotland, Enquire, Partners in Advocacy and Cairn Legal. The project aims to support young people ages 12-15 to access new rights to have a say in decisions about their learning.
Beyond school (4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6) 
To ensure every child, irrespective of background, has an equal chance of entering and succeeding in higher education A Blueprint for Fairness: Final Report of the Commission on Widening Access (2016) made 34 recommendations covering the whole education system which were accepted in full. This led to publication of Implementing ‘A Blueprint for Fairness’: Progress Report in 2017. Scotland’s aim is that by 2030, 20% of students entering university will be from Scotland’s 20% most deprived backgrounds.
The Data Picture: Young people’s participation
Coverage: Scotland 
Global Target 4.3 highlights the importance of ensuring equal access for all women and men to affordable and quality technical, vocational and tertiary education, including university. In 2018, the participation rate for 16 to 19-year-old females is 92.5%, in comparison to 91.2% for males.

• No Knives Better Lives (NKBL): Since 2009, 
Scotland and the NKBL National Delivery Team (based at YouthLink Scotland) have supported partners in 11 local authorities to implement NKBL locally. This support is now available to all local authorities in Scotland.
• Closing the Attainment Gap: A Youth Work & Schools Partnership programme, funded under the Scottish Attainment Challenge, promoting and expanding the role of youth work in closing the poverty-related attainment gap. 
Wales
Action to effective learning (4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4)
Wales is delivering positive educational results for children and young people to the end of compulsory schooling, at 16 years old. Results have been improving, with the percentage of pupils achieving five secondary school grades A*-C including maths and English / Welsh rising from just over 4 out of 10 pupils in 2007 to 6 out of 10 pupils in 2016.134
The Data Picture: Working-age population with level 4 qualification or above
Coverage: Wales 
The qualification profile of the Welsh population has been improving over time. The proportion of the working age population qualified to Credit and Qualifications Framework for Wales (CQFW) Level 4 or above has increased from 28% in 2008 to 37% in 2017. In terms of the highest qualifications held by the working-age population females are more likely to hold qualifications at Level 4 or above (higher education or equivalent level (40% of females, compared to 35% of males).

Well-being of Wales 2017-18 (2018)
In 2018, for the Foundation Phase and Key Stages 2 to 4 girls’ achievement was higher than boys. (Statistical Release January 2019). This figure is reflected at the tertiary level with 17% more women than men receiving undergraduate qualifications in Wales in 2017/18135, and were more likely to be in apprenticeship programmes.136
‘Education in Wales: Our national mission’ pulls together the educational reforms needed to secure the effective implementation of Wales’s new curriculum. It calls upon international best practice and the education performance expertise of the global Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
The ‘four purposes’ for the new curriculum link directly to the Goals. They seek: 
• Ambitious, capable learners ready to learn throughout their lives. 
• Enterprising, creative contributors ready to play a full part in life and work. 
• Healthy, confident individuals ready to lead fulfilling lives as valued members of society. 
• Ethical, informed citizens ready to be citizens of Wales and the world. 
The education system is increasing the number of individuals able to speak Welsh to one million by 2050. Bilingualism gives more opportunities for people, helping to reduce inequalities of opportunity. In 2017/18, 22% of six to seven-year-olds were assessed in Welsh first language, which will ensure that they become bilingual.137 Cymraeg 2050: One Million Welsh Speakers will increase this to 40% by 2050. 
The work of Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol and the National Centre for Learning Welsh, will increase the availability of post-compulsory education provision in Welsh and ensure that everyone in Wales can develop the language. To facilitate this growth, £51 million of funding will go towards Welsh-medium education.
Early Years (4.2, 4.6)
All 3 and 4-year-olds in Wales are entitled to early education via the Foundation Phase nursery programme. The Foundation Phase is built on learning through play, as evidence shows that this is a powerful tool which can help children to develop and extend their language and communication skills. Around 6 in 10 pupils aged 4 are at a stage of development 
in maths, language, literacy and communication in English that would be consistent with, or greater than, their age according to the framework. Around 9 in 10 pupils are within one stage of development consistent with their age.138
Additional learning needs (4.5)
New legislation for additional learning needs (ALN) has been adopted in Wales for children and young people aged 0-25 as part of a wider ALN transformation programme.
Under the new system, planning will be flexible and responsive, skilled professionals will be confident in identifying needs and deploying strategies to help learners overcome their barriers to learning, and the focus will be on the learner. These reforms have been designed collaboratively with stakeholders having a key role in their development.
Technical, vocational and tertiary education (4.4)
From September 2018, eligible first-time undergraduates will get support to help fund their day-to-day living costs during term time, regardless of where in the UK they study.
Activity Snapshot:
The UN Regional Centre of Expertise (RCE) Cymru is part of an international UN-led network, facilitates collaboration across Welsh Universities to research, develop and promote  a greater understanding of sustainability and  well-being of current and future generations.  It is central to co-developing the sustainable ‘Wales we want’.  
 
RCE Cymru is a community guided in part by the Welsh Universities’ Future Generations Group (HEFGG).
A fi nance package for Postgraduate Master’s study has been introduced, similar to that which is available for undergraduate study. Improved support will encourage more people to qualify at this level, developing their skills and careers. 
Global Education (4.7)
Education for Sustainable Development and Global Citizenship (ESDGC) is delivered throughout compulsory education in Wales. A 2014 review discovered that pupils’ understanding of the key concepts of sustainable development and global citizenship develops appropriately as they progress through school and is secure for each of the seven themes for ESDGC. 
Wales’s new curriculum takes a transformational approach that embeds ESDGC throughout the curriculum through an international dimension, aiming to develop pupils to be ethical, informed citizens. 
Wales’s International Education Programme provides individuals with the knowledge and skills necessary to contribute in a global community, with elements of the project relevant to ESDGC, ESDGC teacher training and Wales-Lesotho teacher placements. 
Activity Snapshot:
ChangeMakers is a global citizenship project which has been delivered since 2012 by partners including Welsh Centre for International Affairs, Fair Trade Wales, Oxfam Cymru, Christian Aid, CAFOD and the Centre for Alternative Technology. ChangeMakers develops young people as global citizens. In the two years since 2016 for which data is available, the programme has focussed on the global topic of refugees and asylum seekers, working with seven schools and 119 ChangeMakers. ChangeMakers have delivered peer learning to over 4,000 of their peers, raised awareness in their communities, and schools have started the journey to become Schools of Sanctuary, all led by ChangeMaker students. Participating schools have embedded the topic into their curriculum and increased their confidence in teaching this topic.
Activity Snapshot:
Ysgol Bro Hyddgen was established as 
Machynlleth local authority’s first all-through (primary plus secondary) school in 2014. The next stage of the project will see the construction of a flagship school building that will, for the first time, bring the primary and secondary campuses on the same site with brand new sporting and community facilities. The new school will be the first all-through school in the UK with Passivhaus accreditation. This means it has been built to exacting standards to require a minimum of energy for heating and cooling. Work is expected to start on site in 2019 with the school due to open by September 2020.
Northern Ireland 
In Northern Ireland several programmes and initiatives are being delivered to ensure children have access to quality child development and learning services.
One year of funded pre-school education is being provided for every child in their immediate pre-school year whose parents want it. In 2018/19, over 23,000 children were offered a funded pre-school place and in the last six years, at least 99.8% of children whose parents stayed with the admissions process received the offer of a funded pre-school place.139
The ‘Getting Ready to Learn’ programme aims to empower pre-school settings to help parents engage effectively and increase awareness of and involvement in their child’s development.
In 2018/19, 77% of settings are participating in the programme.140 In 2017/18, 13,300 families engaged with the programme which delivered improved home learning environments and outcomes for children such as parents reading, playing with them, reduced screentime and increased physical activity.
The 3+ Review is a collaboration between education, health practitioners and parents which takes place in the pre-school setting. It aims to review the child’s development and identify any intervention required. 
In 2017/18, around 85% of pre-school practitioners felt parents and children benefitted from the 3+ Review.141
An Executive Ten-Year Childcare Strategy is being developed (subject to Northern Ireland Executive approval).
A 2018 parental engagement campaign “Give your child a helping hand” is emphasising the importance of parents supporting their child’s learning.
The Extended Schools Programme delivered 3,455 additional services and activities before, during and after the normal school day, including literacy and numeracy support, parental and community engagement, promoting healthy lifestyles and breakfast clubs. 
Activity Snapshot:
Business in the Community Northern Ireland delivers an Education Programme aimed at engaging businesses to work with schools to help children develop vital skills around literacy and numeracy and raise their aspirations by inspiring them about the world of work.
In Northern Ireland, between 2015 and 2017, the percentage of people in employment qualified to level 4, 3 and 2 education had increased by 2.8, 3.0 and 1.5 percentage points respectively. However, this has slightly reduced for level 1 - 0.1 percentage points people in employment.142 Care leavers in education, training or employment have also now increased to 65% in 2017-18, compared to 61% in 2016-17.143
In 2016/17, in Northern Ireland, 30% more pupils who were entitled to Free School Meals (FSME) left secondary education without five A*-C grades than pupils who did not receive FSME. Over the same period the proportion of pupils achieving five A*-C grades and not in receipt of FSME increased 58.5% to 77.4%, while for those in receipt of FSME this attainment level increased from 26.4% to 47.5%.144
A range of interventions have been aimed at improving the life chances of children and young people. The ‘Sharing the Learning Programme’ in West Belfast is one such example. In 2017-18, the programme improved attainment levels across the education spectrum for children and young people experiencing disadvantage through poverty, exclusion and social, emotional and behavioural difficulties. The following was achieved145:
i. 700 more families with nursery-aged children received support than planned;
ii. 662 additional 5 to 11-year-old children received literacy and numeracy support;
iii. 353 additional children and parents availed of the After Schools literacy and numeracy support and Family Learning;
iv. 233 children received support through the Summer Transition Programme;
v. 85% of parents of nursery children reported that they are involved with their children’s education at home and understand what is required of their child;
vi. 75% of participating children showed an increase 
in levels for literacy, numeracy and information and communications technology;
vii. 70% of participating schools demonstrated increased community use of schools; and
viii. 64.3% of students involved in the programme achieved five or more GCSEs (A*-C) or equivalent including English and Maths.
Activity Snapshot:
Keep Northern Ireland Beautiful has every school in Northern Ireland committed to engaging in the pupil-led Eco-Schools programme, delivering inclusive and equitable quality education that supports critical thinking and the acquisition of knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable lifestyles.

The UK’s Get Children Learning policy is focussed on helping the 330 million children in developing countries who are not expected to be able to read or do basic maths by the end of primary school. The UK works in close partnership with 23 countries to improve teaching, strengthen systems, and reach the most marginalised children. The UK supports a further 66 countries through global programmes like the Global Partnership for Education (GPE). Through Education Cannot Wait the immense challenge of education in crises is addressed and through the Safe to Learn campaign work is done to end violence in schools. 
In April 2018, the UK launched the Leave No Girl Behind campaign calling for 12 years of quality education for all girls. In June 2018, 152 UN Member States signed up to a UK-led joint statement on girls’ education. In tandem, the UK launched a second phase of the Girls’ Education Challenge supporting up to 1.5 million marginalised girls with access to basic education and skills for life up to 2025.

Connecting Classrooms through Global Learning (CCGL) is the UK’s principal development education programme. £38 million is being invested in CCGL, from 2018 to 2021 and aiming to reach 3 million children. CCGL focusses on children aged 7 to 14 and supports partnerships between primary and secondary schools across the UK and developing countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, the Middle East and North Africa. Through their participation, the children will gain the skills, knowledge, attitudes and values that they will need to live and eventually work in the global economy. The programme provides training for 60,000 teachers and school leaders in the UK and developing countries, on topics such as working together on the Goals, teaching global citizenship, teaching transferable skills and ensuring education is inclusive.
Teaching workforce [4.c]
By 2030, the UN estimates an additional 69 million skilled teachers will be required to deliver quality education for all.147 The UK supports the Education Workforce Initiative to develop, redesign, expand, and strengthen the global education workforce, improve education and meet demographic demands. Research in Ghana, Vietnam and Sierra Leone will develop practical options to tackle the challenge of workforce reform and inspire other governments to take action. 
Activity Snapshot:
The UK has a strong partnership with Tanzania to improve the quality of education for poor and marginalised children. The £90 million EQUIP-T programme operates in nine regions of Tanzania and has provided leadership training for head teachers and in-service training for teachers. Alongside, the British Council works on English language training and runs the Chevening Scholarship scheme.
Scholarships & international exchange [4.b]
The British Council is the UK’s international organisation for cultural relations and educational opportunities. It supports international school links, studying English with UK institutions, studying for UK qualifications and attendance at major cultural events or exhibitions organised by a UK institution. A £2.5 million International School Exchanges programme will give thousands of secondary pupils in England from disadvantaged backgrounds access to life-changing experiences and academic opportunities offered by overseas visits. 
Activity Snapshot:
The UK’s Chevening programme offers scholarships as an opportunity for future leaders and decision-makers around the world to develop professionally and academically. In 2018, the UK welcomed 1,750 scholars from 160 countries and territories and provided 100 additional places for scholars across Sub-Saharan Africa. The scheme promotes values such as human rights and sustainable development.
The International Citizen Service (ICS) has supported over 36,000 young people from the UK and overseas to volunteer on sustainable development projects. Placements are currently operating in Tanzania, Uganda, Nigeria, Kenya, Zambia, Cambodia, Nepal and Bangladesh. For instance, since 2016, 150 ICS volunteers from the UK and Kenya have been supporting the community in Nandi, Kenya to reduce stigma and marginalisation for deaf and disabled community members.
Activity Snapshot:
The Global Social Enterprise project aims to enhance the employability of individuals, particularly young people and disadvantaged groups. Since 2009, the programme has trained 17,590 social entrepreneurs. Promoting gender equality within education is a key focus of British Council projects. In Turkey it has worked with 40 schools to develop the capacities of teachers and staff to work on gender equality. The project also developed recommendations to the government for changes in education policies and the school curriculum, based on a review of policies, legislation, curricula and textbooks.
The Commonwealth Scholarship Commission (CSC) awards scholarships and fellowships to Commonwealth citizens for postgraduate study and professional development. Candidates are selected on merit and their potential to build expertise that will benefit the development of countries when grantees return home. Over £26 million in funding for 2018/19 will provide for approximately 750 new awards and support over 950 students. 
The UK’s International Education Strategy: global potential, global growth, published March 2019, sets out how the education sector will grow exports and exchange knowledge between and with other countries, while supporting the exchange and mobility of students and staff.
Activity Snapshot:
Credit Suisse’s Impact and Advisory Finance Department is helping re-shape the face of investing by helping clients “generate returns sustainably” and invest in products that further the Goals. The Higher Education Notes give Credit Suisse’s client base the opportunity to invest towards Goal 4. The notes provide financing to students who will typically have no alternative source of funding to allow them to access higher education at leading universities such as Cambridge and Oxford. To date, more than 4,000 students from more than 115 countries have received funding via the Higher Education Notes, the majority of which would have been unable to access Higher Education without these notes. 
Challenges and next steps 
Tackling disadvantage and closing the  attainment gap
Socio-economic disadvantage remains a key factor for inequality in educational attainment. In 2018, the attainment gap in England, measured by the disadvantage gap index, had narrowed by 6.5% since 2015 at primary school. In 2017/2018 the gap had narrowed by 3.1% by the end of secondary school compared to 2014/2015, but there is no room for complacency.148
In England, innovative expansion of school-based nursery provision and training for early years professionals in disadvantaged areas will give children a better start at school. For pupils aged 5 to 16, the pupil premium provides £2.4 billion extra funding each year, so schools can arrange extra support and enrichment opportunities so disadvantaged pupils can realise their potential. Universities are working to open more places to students from poorer backgrounds by doubling the number of places offered to pupils who claimed free school meals. Scotland will further raise awareness of the Goals throughout learning in Scotland to galvanise action across society. Wales is identifying new and effective ways to measure and improve learner wellbeing. The Pupil Development Grant (PDG) is being expanded, building on its success in narrowing the attainment gap and breaking down the barriers faced by learners. In Northern Ireland, programmes such as the ‘Sharing the Learning Programme’ in West Belfast are demonstrating how educational outcomes of children in significant disadvantage can be improved.
The teacher workforce. 
The retention of early career teachers has been declining in recent years. In England, around 20% of new teachers leave the profession within their first two years of teaching, and around 30% leave within their first five years.149
The 2019 Teacher Recruitment and Retention Strategy aims to tackle these issues while the Early Career Framework will support early career teachers with an entitlement to a fully-funded, two-year package of structured support. In Wales, new professional standards will be developed for teachers and others in the education workforce focussing on the essential elements of successful teaching; as well as developing standards for support staff that can enable them to improve their skills, commit to professional learning and facilitate clearer pathways to the role of higherlevel teaching assistant.
Improving provision
In England, technical education performance needs to improve to boost productivity, close skills gaps and raise wages. At the heart of this change will be the new T Levels which give young people a clear path into skilled work. This system will be overseen by the new Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education in partnership with employers. In 2019, a review informed by independent advice from education, business and academia will determine how to improve the quality, choice and value for money of all post-18 education. 
In Wales, the new curriculum will address multiple challenges, including:
• perceived shortcomings in the current curriculum and assessment arrangements;
• OECD-reported low performance for a high proportion of learners, including relatively low performance in Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) surveys; 
• the perception that prescriptive content and powerful accountability mechanisms have diminished the creative role of education professionals; and
• features of the curriculum devised in 1988 which no longer reflect the world of technology and globalisation. 
Wales will be using the new curriculum by September 2022, after being finalised following feedback and refinement during 2019. 
In Northern Ireland, over £77 million of targeted social need funding will be distributed to schools via the common funding formula. The funding is used to support pupils, by employing teachers, engaging with parents and communities, providing literacy and numeracy support, supporting transition between schools and supporting emotional health and wellbeing. A new online monitoring system introduced in 2019 will enable schools to share good practice.

Goal 5: Gender Equality
Achieve gender equality 
and empower all women and girls
Summary 
No country can truly develop if it leaves half its population behind. Every woman and girl should have the freedom, choice, support and protection to do whatever she wants to do.
The UK is at the forefront of gender equality. Lives are being transformed in the UK with record numbers of women in work, and with more women on the boards of the largest private companies than ever before. Stronger action is also working to protect women from violence, domestic abuse and harmful practices such as Female Genital Mutilation (FGM). Internationally, the UK is committed to empowering all women, reaching the most vulnerable and marginalised women with targeted action through the UK’s international development programmes. 
The focus now is on accelerating the pace of change to ensure that all women and girls are empowered to make informed choices and play an active part in all aspects of society. Closing the gender pay gap, increasing women’s participation in the field of maths and science and tackling global violence will be key to doing this. 
Achieving gender equality is contingent on making progress across many of the 17 Goals. This chapter focusses largely on assessments related to eliminating violence and harmful practices against women and girls, promoting women’s economic empowerment and their full and effective participation, and ensuring access to sexual and reproductive health and rights.
Leave No One Behind examples:
• I n England, a new Gender Equality and Economic Empowerment strategy (to be published in 2019) will set out plans to address the persistent gendered economic barriers women and men face at every stage of their lives, with a particular focus on low-paid and financially-fragile women, women facing multiple barriers or with complex needs.
• I n Scotland, the Fairer Scotland for Women: Gender Pay Gap Action Plan was launched on International Women’s Day 2019. It sets out an approach to reduce the gender pay gap and tackle labour market inequalities faced by women, particularly disabled women, minority ethnic women, women from poorer socio-economic backgrounds and women with caring responsibilities. 
• I n Wales, the Gender Equality Review was launched on International Women’s Day 2018. As part of Phase 2 of the Review, the Welsh Government has published its vision for gender equality in Wales, and has developed principles for a feminist Welsh Government. Chwarae Teg will publish its Phase 2 report in summer 2019, setting out what steps need to be taken for Wales to achieve gender equality.
• I n Northern Ireland, Business in the Community Northern Ireland delivers a Diversity and Inclusion Programme which encourages and supports businesses to understand diversity issues and work to create balanced and inclusive workplaces, with equal opportunity for all.
• I nternationally, the UK is ensuring that gender equality remains at the heart of the UK’s overseas development work through the UK International Development Act (Gender Equality) 2014, which makes a consideration of gender equality in all UK Official Development Assistance (ODA) a legal requirement.

Action in the UK
Strengthening policies and legislation to  promote gender equality and end  discrimination (5.1, 5.a, 5.c)
Improving outcomes for all women and girls is a must to help women realise their potential and ensure a society where no one is left behind.
In 2015, the EU Gender Equality Index ranked the UK sixth in the EU for its progress towards gender equality150 - unchanged since 2012 - due to some of the strongest legislation in the world protecting women’s rights and tackling discrimination. The Equality Act 2010 and the Public Sector Equality Duty both work to prohibit direct and indirect discrimination, harassment, and victimisation. 
Eliminating all forms of violence and harmful practices against women and girls (5.2, 5.3)
Gender-based violence and harmful practices are pervasive, dangerous and must be eliminated. 
Activity snapshot: 
Online gender-based abuse is a huge barrier that prevents women from participating fully in public life. Glitch – a civil society organisation has provided a Toolkit on how everyone can play their part in ending online gender-based violence, this has been downloaded worldwide. Glitch is also delivering Digital Resilience training. These are tailored for one-to-one consultations and group workshops for women in all forms of public life. 100% of workshop participants have reported gaining skills to be safer and resilient online, 93% of participants feel expressing and being themselves online, while 85% of participants reported improved confidence levels using social media. 
Whilst long-term overall decrease in the percentage of women who experienced partner abuse in the previous 12 months has slowed in recent years, between 
2016/17 and 2017/18 there was a small increase from 
5.95% to 6.26%.151
Whilst reporting of sexual violence has risen in recent years, there have been reductions in prosecutions and convictions for rape cases. In 2017/18, the volume of rape prosecutions fell by 13% to 4,517 and the volume of rape convictions fell by 11.9% to 2,635.152 In response, the UK Government has committed to an ‘end to end’ review of the criminal justice system in England and Wales in relation to rape and serious sexual offences.
The UK government’s landmark draft Domestic Abuse 
Bill, published in January 2019, and the refreshed Violence Against Women and Girls Strategy (2019), both aim to prevent all forms of domestic abuse. Together, they will help to ensure that victims have the confidence to come forward and report their experience, knowing that the justice system and other agencies will do everything they can to protect and support them, and pursue their abuser.
This principle extends to victims of harmful practices like forced marriages, and FGM which has been illegal in the UK since 1985. In 2018, 0.6 per thousand women aged 20-24 had married by the age of 18, a small fall compared to the 2015 rate (0.8 per thousand).153 In 2017/18, there were 220 new cases of FGM per 1 million people in the UK, a slight increase from 205 in 2015/16.154 Changes in 2015 strengthened FGM law to make it a criminal offence for UK nationals to perform or arrange FGM overseas; increased the maximum prison sentence from 5 to 14 years; and allowed FGM victims to obtain lifelong anonymity. These changes, alongside FGM Protection Orders and a new duty for professionals to notify the police, if they discover that an act of FGM appears to have been carried out on a girl who is under 18,  helped the UK secure its first conviction for FGM in February 2019.
The UK is committed to tackling modern slavery, including the trafficking of women and girls for sexual exploitation. A total of £11.6 million of additional funding has been invested in the police in England and Wales to develop dedicated modern slavery capabilities and the National Crime Agency has led multi-agency operations to target organised sexual exploitation.
Activity snapshot: 
To combat the harmful practice of FGM the Royal College of Nursing has developed information resources that set out the national standards for mandatory reporting on FGM and educate and train nurses and midwives on how to identify and appropriately support girls and women affected by FGM. 
Promoting Women’s Economic Empowerment  and shared responsibility within the household, and ensuring full and effective participation  (5.4, 5.5, 5.a, 5.b)
The UK is clear that unlocking women’s economic potential will help deliver growth and prosperity for all.
Lives in the UK are being transformed with record numbers of women in work. In 2018, 71.2% of working women were in employment, an increase from 68.9% three years earlier.155 However, women are still three times more likely to work part-time than men156 and carry out 60% more unpaid care and domestic work.157 In 2016, the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimated that for every year spent out of paid work, women returning to work earn 2% less on average and 4% for highly-qualified women.158 To address some of these trends, Shared Parental Leave and Pay was introduced in 2015, which enables working parents to share up to 50 weeks of leave and up to 37 weeks of pay in the first year of the child’s life. 
Affordable, quality childcare is the key to unlocking women’s economic participation. In the UK, 74% of childcare time was carried out by women in 2015159 and 89% of people who are inactive due to looking after the family and home are women.160 From September 2017, the childcare entitlement for working parents of 3- and 4-year olds, was doubled from 15 to 30 hours a week in England. The most disadvantaged 2-year-olds are entitled to 15 hours a week of free early education. Eligibility for the 30 hours entitlement is based on parental income (see Goal 4).
The national gender pay gap for full-time employees reached its lowest level of 8.6% in 2018, down from 9.6% in 2015161, following changes in workplace culture and the introduction of the UK’s world-leading pay gap regulations in 2017. In the first year (2018) of reporting, over 10,000 employers reported their gender pay data to government.162 In September last year, the UK announced a review led by Alison Rose into the barriers women face in setting up and growing a business. A response was published in March 2019.
The Data Picture: Attitudes to gender roles
Coverage: Great Britain
There has been a shift in attitudes to gender roles among the British public. The proportion of people agreeing that “a man’s job is to earn the money; a woman’s job is to take care of the home and family” has fallen significantly over time, from 43% in 1984, to 12% in 2012 and further to 8% in 2017. This has been mirrored by an increase in the percentage of people disagreeing with the statement from 37% in 1984, to 65% in 2012 and to 72% in 2017.

There is also a higher percentage of women on boards of FTSE163 companies than ever before, with women holding 26.7% of seats in the FTSE 350 (up from 21.9% in 2015) and 30.2% in the FTSE 100 (up from 26.1% in 2015).164 The percentage of managerial positions held by women has been gradually increasing over time, rising from 37.3% in 2015 to 37.9% in 2017.165

The Data Picture: Gender Pay Gap 
(GPG)
Coverage: UK
On all headline measures, the GPG is closing.  The overall GPG has decreased to 17.9% from 19.3% in 2015 when the Goals were agreed.  The GPG for full-time employees has decreased  to 8.6% from 9.6% over the same period.  The GPG for part-time employees has decreased to -4.4% from -6.8% in 2015.  The part-time GPG is in favour of women, and  so this also represents a closing of the gap.

1997 to 2018
 
Source: ONS, Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (2018)
The GPG generally increases with age. The largest pay gap exists for 50 to 59-year-olds (25.9%) but is much lower for younger employees at 1.4% for 18 to 21-year-olds. The larger pay gap for older women could be explained by three key factors: time taken out of the workforce to care for children; that younger women are, in general, better qualified compared to their male peers than older women; and lower earnings progression over the course of their career for women compared to men (e.g. due to working part-time) source.

The decision to open-up all combat roles to women is a defining moment in the history of the armed forces. Females were unable to serve in ground close combat roles until the ban was lifted in 2016. The Royal Armoured Corps, followed by the RAF Regiment, were the first to open its doors to female soldiers and officers. From October 2018 all roles, including joining the Royal Marines, were opened to women. There were 20,480 women serving in the armed forces as of October 2018.166 Those currently serving can transfer into all roles and new recruits have begun basic training.  This change will ensure that entry to the armed forces is determined by ability alone and not gender.
The UK’s second female Prime Minister entered office in 2016 and the first female Secretary of State for Defence was appointed in 2019. The UK currently has the most diverse Parliament in its history with the highest number of women Members of Parliament ever. Women represent 32% of MPs elected in 2017, an increase from 29% in 2015.167 Women also now hold more senior positions than before in the Senior Civil Service (42.7% in March 2018, an increase from 38.9% in 2015)168 , and the first female Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police in 2017. 
Ensuring access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights (5.6)
Everyone should have control over their own bodies and their own futures. That means every girl and woman having access to the information they need; to choose what’s right for them, to support their decisions. Abortion is available in more limited circumstances in Northern Ireland than the rest of the UK.
7% of females in England aged between 13 and 54 had at least one contact with a sexual reproduction and health service in 2017/2018, down from 8% in 2014/15.169  
In England, teenage pregnancies are at the lowest rates ever recorded - the under-18 conception rate was 17.9 conceptions per thousand women aged 15 to 17 years in 2017, a 15% decrease since 2015.170 To equip young people for adult life and to enable them to make a positive contribution to society, the UK is making Relationships Education compulsory in all primary schools, Relationships and Sex Education compulsory in all secondary schools and Health Education compulsory in all primary and secondary state-funded schools. A new scheme will also provide access to free period products in schools and 16-19 education institutions in England. 
Activity snapshot: 
Brook, the young people’s sexual health and well-being charity and girls’ rights charity Plan International UK are committed to tackling period poverty in England.
‘Let’s talk. Period’ is a three-part project consisting of:
• a P-Card scheme for young people, providing them with education and access to free period products;
• building a community of professionals to work together to develop effective best practice models; and
• a small grants scheme to support smaller organisations to tackle period poverty.
Scotland
Scotland’s First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon MSP, was appointed as the first global advocate for the UN’s #HeforShe campaign and has made concrete commitments to advancing gender equality around the world and support UN Women in their work to end global gender inequality. 
The National Advisory Council on Women and Girls advises the First Minister on what is needed to tackle gender inequality in Scotland.
Scotland has taken action to tackle gender-based inequality, such as period poverty with free sanitary products being made available to pupils, students and learners at schools, colleges and universities.
Violence against women and girls (5.1, 5.2, 5.3)
Scotland has a strong legislative framework, that in addition to wider provisions, includes:
• Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation (Scotland) 	 Act 2005;
• Forced Marriage etc (Protection and Jurisdiction) 	 (Scotland) Act 2011;
• Abusive Behaviour and Sexual Harm (Scotland) 	  Act 2015; and
• Domestic Abuse (Scotland) Act 2018.
Violence against women and girls is a challenge that requires a partnership response. The Equally Safe approach in Scotland does this with government – national and local, delivery partners, networks and  an underpinning framework to measure progress  and performance.
The National Action Plan to Prevent and Eradicate Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) is a partnership approach between Police Scotland, NHS, third sector, local authorities and the Scottish Government to prioritise the protection from and prevention of FGM; provide services and appropriate support for those  who have experienced FGM and hold perpetrators  to account.
The Data Picture: Domestic abuse
Coverage: Scotland
Global Target 5.2 is about eliminating all forms of violence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres, including trafficking and sexual and other types of exploitation.
Levels of domestic abuse recorded by the police in Scotland have remained relatively stable since 2011-12, with around 58,000 to 60,000 incidents a year. The police recorded 59,541 incidents of domestic abuse in 2017-18, an increase of 1% compared to the previous year

Women’s participation and equal opportunities 
(5.5)
Sustainable and inclusive growth sits alongside increased well-being at the heart of Scotland’s National Performance Framework and this Goal is important to achieve that aim. The gender employment and pay gap has narrowed considerably, but still exists. 
The gender pay gap for full-time employees in Scotland has decreased from 6.6% in 2017 to 5.7% in 2018 the lowest gender pay gap on record for Scotland.171 The gender pay gap for all employees in Scotland has also decreased from 16% in 2017, to 15% in 2018.172  
In Scotland, public authorities with 20 or more employees must publish gender gap information and statements on equal pay. The Gender Pay Gap Action Plan includes a number of actions aimed at addressing occupational segregation, increasing the availability of well-paid flexible employment and improving the labour market conditions for women in Scotland. The action plan includes over 50 actions, including a grant scheme to help employers embed equality, and a Returners scheme to support around 2,000 women to return to the workplace after a break.
The commitment in Scotland to free early learning and childcare, with 1,140 hours per year from 2020 will further reduce barriers preventing parents from working.
The Scottish Government has a gender-balanced 
Cabinet, however only 35% of Members of Scottish Parliament (MSPs) in the Scottish Parliament and 29% of councillors in local government are women.173 
The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA) has launched a story sharing campaign and a safe online space which aims to provide peer support both for women considering entering local government and those already active within it. CoSLA has also identified actions to improve women’s representation in local government. 
Further actions related to this Goal include:
• Gender Representation on Public Boards (Scotland) 	 Act 2018 sets a gender representation objective for a public board that 50% of non-executive members should be women;
• Scottish Fire and Rescue Service launched a new recruitment campaign to find 300 new firefighters 
with specific actions to attract women applicants; and
• Women in Agriculture Taskforc 	e to tackle inequality and create equality of opportunity in Scottish agriculture.
Wales 
Wales has ambitions to become a world leader for women’s rights and gender equality. The Gender Equality Review will submit its Phase 2 report in summer 2019 and will set out a roadmap for achieving gender equality in Wales and focussing on equality  of outcome rather than equality of opportunity.  The Welsh Government has announced capital and revenue funding to provide suitable dispensers and products in all schools in Wales and in Further Education establishments. The Welsh National Health Service (NHS) is also providing period products via Health Boards.
Activity snapshot: 
The Welsh Government-funded WEN Wales is a vibrant network of over 1,000 organisations and individuals committed to making Wales a safer and fairer place for women and girls. Their work is underpinned by the UN Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against 
Women (CEDAW).
End discrimination against all women and girls (5.1)
The gender pay gap has continued to narrow and is now one of the lowest levels on record in Wales. But Wales’s  indicator shows women are less likely than men to be in good quality employment.174 As across the rest of the UK, employment rates in Wales are lower for women than for men – 70.6% for women and 78.9% for men in July 2018.175 Economic inactivity rates are higher for women (26.7%) than men (17.6%).176 On International Women’s Day 2018 the then First Minister announced his intention to “conduct a Rapid Review of our gender and equality policies and bring new impetus to our work”. The review has looked at what is already done well, identify what can be improved, and look at examples from governments around the world to learn from their models and practices. The roadmap which will be delivered as part of the Phase 2 activity will set out what needs to be done to achieve gender equality in Wales with a focus on equality of outcome.

Eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls, including trafficking (5.2)
Violence against women, domestic abuse and sexual violence (VAWDASV) is a fundamental violation of human rights, a cause and consequence of inequality and has far-reaching consequences for families, children and society as a whole. The Violence against Women, Domestic Abuse and Sexual Violence (Wales) Act 2015 is intended to ensure a focus across the public sector on the prevention of these issues, the protection of victims and the support for those affected by such issues. 
The Welsh Government’s five-year national strategy lays out how the Act will be implemented and includes challenging the attitudes that underpin VAWDSV and the support that will be put in place for prevention, protection and support.
Activity snapshot: 
Live Fear Free is a Welsh Government website, providing information and advice for those suffering violence against women, domestic abuse and sexual violence. This is primarily a helpline for those suffering with domestic abuse and sexual violence.
Eliminate harmful practices (5.3)
Wales’s National Strategy on Violence Against Women, Domestic Abuse and Sexual Violence includes a commitment to challenge cultural attitudes which can underpin these traditional harmful practices. The Welsh Government is doing this with national campaigns, working with and supporting specialist BME violence against women services.
Valuing unpaid care and domestic work (5.4)
Wales is committed to supporting unpaid care givers. The delivery of enhanced rights for all carers is enshrined in the Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act 2014. A new Ministerial Advisory Group for Carers was created in 2018, to bring together the public and third sectors to explore the issues and solutions, to the concerns of carers of all ages and genders. Full and effective participation of women (5.5)
Wales is working hard to give women and girls opportunities to fulfil their potential addressing gender equity in all STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Maths)-related funding. Welsh Government are tackling gender stereotyping around STEM— training physics teachers in gender-inclusive teaching methods and funding specific computer-coding workshops to engage and motivate girls. Wales’s STEM Cymru 2 programme aims to encourage more young women to progress into engineering careers. To date, over 3,000 young women have engaged with the programme.177 
In 2019 the Welsh Government outlined its approach to supporting women entrepreneurs and published a good practice guide for business support organisations on how best to engage with women who are setting up or already running their own business. 
Access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights (5.6)
A multi-agency Programme Board maintains oversight of the sexual health and services provided in Wales. In 2019, the programme board endorsed a national specification for sexual health services including improved access to contraception and abortion services. 
The Welsh Government has issued a notification allowing the administration of the second abortion pill, misoprostol, in the home environment. Women will only require one appointment at a clinic, resulting in access at an earlier, safer stage of pregnancy.
 The Data Picture: gender pay gap
Coverage: Wales
The gender pay gap has continued to narrow and is now one of the lowest levels on record in Wales. However, the indicator shows women are less likely than men to be in good quality employment and fewer women are employed in work that meets the Welsh national indicator definition of good quality employment (51.8% compared with 75.2% for men) and there remains a significant gap in employment outcomes for disabled people.
The pay gap based on median full-time hourly earnings stood at 6.3% in 2017, down from 7.9% in 2016. For part-time employees in Wales, women are paid 7.0% more on average than men. 
These gaps do not take account of factors such as education levels and experience which vary across the genders and which will affect earning levels.

Northern Ireland’s approach to sustainability is through the draft Programme for Government (PfG) Strategy. The primary aim is to mainstream sustainability in Departmental plans and actions. Part of the “mainstreaming” approach, which obviated the need for separate strategies, was to ensure that sustainability was reflected throughout the draft PfG. The Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) with the collaboration of other departments across the Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS), completed an exercise mapping draft PfG outcomes and indicators to the Goals.
Actions Taken
Providing women and girls with equal access to education, health care, decent work, and representation in political and economic decisionmaking processes will fuel sustainable economies and benefit societies and humanity at large. Implementing new legal frameworks regarding female equality in the workplace and the eradication of harmful practices targeted at women is crucial to ending the genderbased discrimination prevalent in many countries around the world.

Valuing Diversity in Nursing has been established as a subgroup of Nursing Now Northern Ireland. A key aim of this group is to promote Nursing as a career with children and young adults and to actively promote nursing with boys and men.
UK action around the world 
TThe UK is supporting international progress towards gender equality targets across the Goals. Since the Goals were agreed in 2015, UK aid has provided 16.9 million women and girls with modern methods of family planning; reached at least 8.2 million women and girls with humanitarian assistance; and supported 5.6 million girls in gaining a decent education.178 The UK’s funding has contributed to helping 24.5 million people from 8,000 communities pledge to end FGM179 and more than 4.8 million people, including community members and religious leaders, to learn about the benefits of delaying marriage and keeping adolescent girls in school.180
Activity snapshot: 
The UK is investing in world-leading research and evidence to ensure a better understanding of who, where and why people are being left behind and the impact programmes are having on them.
The Gender and Adolescence: Global Evidence Programme is the largest global study on adolescents, following 18,000 girls and boys in developing countries, a substantial sample of them refugees or displaced people, to understand what works to enhance adolescent capabilities and empowerment. 
Department for International Development’s (DFID)’ Inclusive Data Charter Action Plan is promoting data disaggregation even in the most fragile or humanitarian contexts. Through this, the UK can make better decisions that positively impact all people’s lives, including for the poorest and most marginalised, who are at risk of being left behind.
Ending Violence Against Women and Girls  
(5.2, 5.3)
The UK is a global leader in tackling violence against women and girls (VAWG) in all its forms– be it domestic violence, sexual violence, FGM, or Child, Early and Forced Marriage. The UK’s flagship What Works to Prevent VAWG research programme works in 15 countries in Africa and Asia to understand and address the underlying causes of violence, to stop it from occurring and find interventions that can be taken to scale. In addition to generating evidence, the UK is contributing £21 million to organisations working to prevent VAWG and improve access to services for women and girls who experience violence. Since 2016, the UK has supported 67 organisations in 46 countries.181
The UK champions the Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict Initiative (PSVI), working with international partners to tackle the stigma survivors face, strengthen justice for survivors and hold perpetrators to account, and prevent conflict-related sexual violence, including by tackling the root causes of gender inequality and discrimination.
In November 2018, Lord Ahmad, the Prime Minister’s Special Representative on Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict hosted a PSVI film festival ‘Fighting Stigma through Film’ and will host the PSVI international conference in November 2019. 
The UK announced in November 2018 a £50 million package to support an African-led movement to put an end to FGM by 2030 – the biggest single investment by an international donor. 
The UK is also at the forefront of international efforts to end Child, Early and Forced Marriage. Through UK aid, 9 countries have been supported to develop 
National Action Plans to end child marriage and over 1.12 million girls have been reached since 2015 with schooling initiatives, skills training and girls’ clubs to prevent and respond to child marriage.182 
Since the Forced Marriage Unit was established in 2005, it has assisted in over 10,000 cases involving a victim or potential victim, in over 110 countries.183  
The UK’s is working overseas to reduce the vulnerability of women and girls to human trafficking. For instance, in Ethiopia, UK aid has provided health and educational support to over 200 girls who experienced or were at risk of exploitation, and in 2019 the UK launched a new media campaign with Nigeria’s anti-trafficking agency to prevent women from being trafficked to the UK.
Women’s Political Participation and Leadership (5.5)
The UK is committed to improving the opportunities for women to have a say in decisions that affect their lives. For example, in Pakistan, the Conflict, Stability and Security Fund (CSSF) provided support to Pakistan’s Election Commission’s campaign to bolster women’s participation in elections through civic outreach, street theatre, social media and radio. The campaign directly facilitated 405,000 women to acquire National Identity Cards184 and UK support led to an addition of 4.3 million more women to the electoral roll.185 
In November 2018, the UK Parliament and government jointly hosted over 100 female parliamentarians from around the world to promote women’s political participation at the Women MPs of the World Conference.
At the 2018 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) the UK committed to a £1.6 million project to increase women’s meaningful participation in peace processes, including through the Women 
Mediators across the Commonwealth (WMC) initiative.
Sexual and reproductive health and rights  
(5.1, 5.6)
The UK is a world leader in promoting and supporting sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR). Since 2015, UK aid has provided 16.9 million women and girls with modern methods of family planning.186 At the UK’s 2017 Family Planning Summit, the UK committed to spend an average of £225 million per year on family planning (2017/18-2021/22). It is estimated that, every year, UK investment will support nearly 20 million total users of contraception, prevent 6 million unintended pregnancies, and thus prevent more than 3 million abortions, many of which would be unsafe. It will save the lives of over 6,000 women every year.187 On maternal and child health UK government invested an average of approximately £1 billion per year across bilateral programmes and multilateral organisations from 2014-2017.188
Activity snapshot: 
The Amplify Change Fund, funded by UK aid, is working to support women’s rights civil society organisations (CSOs) and activists across a range of issues related to sexual and reproductive health and rights, including sexual violence, female genital mutilation, abortion, and child marriage. It has so far supported 510 CSOs in 58 countries, primarily in the global south. 
The UK’s Strategic Vision for Gender Equality of March 2018 sets out the UK’s global leadership in securing, with partners, the rights of all girls and women globally, particularly in fragile and conflict-affected states and in humanitarian and protracted crises. It focusses on five pillars: girls’ education; violence against women and girls; sexual and reproductive health and rights; women’s economic empowerment; and women’s political empowerment.
The UK National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security (WPS) (2018-2022) sets out how the UK will meet its WPS commitments under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 to reduce the impact of conflict on women and girls and to promote their inclusion in conflict resolution.
Challenges and next steps
Progressing women’s economic empowerment and closing the gender pay gap
In England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland having access to a better job is important in addressing inequalities. Employment brings a range of benefits to individuals and communities by increasing levels of health, confidence, self-respect and social inclusion.
On closing the gender pay gap, reporting is just the first step. What matters most is that employers now take action to close their gender pay gaps. The UK is urging employers to develop an action plan to identify and tackle the causes of their gender pay gap. Evidence-based guidance has been published to support employers to take the most effective action. Increasing women and girls’ participation in STEM
The UK is investing in a number of programmes that aim to increase girls’ engagement in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects, to ensure girls and boys can succeed on an equal basis. This includes the Stimulating Physics Network which is rolling out tried and tested approaches to improve engagement by girls in physics, the Advanced Mathematics Support Programme, and a new £84 million programme to drive up participation in computer science which will include some focus on improving participation by girls. Making girls aware of the range of careers to which studying STEM subjects can lead is also important and the Government funds initiatives such as the STEM Ambassadors Programme that brings STEM business and industry representatives into schools.
Tackling violence against women and girls around the world
The UK recognises that much more needs to be done to prevent the extremely high levels of violence that women and girls experience every day around the world. Investment in generating evidence of what works to prevent VAWG, particularly amongst the most marginalised, including adolescent girls and women and girls with disabilities continues, whilst advocacy for greater investment in interventions to prevent and respond to VAWG is also being scaled up.
Global rollback on women’s rights
There is an increasingly coordinated and effective opposition to women’s rights, including women’s and girls’ access to SRHR, education and preventing violence against women and girls. Whilst these concerns are not new, this opposition appears to now be more coordinated, better funded and able to mobilise more efficiently than ever before. This is creating a more hostile global environment on gender equality, with hard-won global norms protecting girls and women being challenged. The UK will stand by its commitment to promote gender equality and women’s empowerment in the face of this challenge.

Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation
Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all
Summary 
The UK is proud of its commitment to improve the environment, within a generation, and leave it in a better state than it was found in. The UK government’s 25 Year Environment Plan sets out a range of measures to achieve clean and plentiful water. There has been important progress in recent years. England, for example, now has consistently high levels of clean bathing waters,189 serious pollution incidents are steadily declining190 and rivers that were biologically dead are reviving.191 The current condition of water bodies in Scotland is improving. Water quality in rivers in Wales has also generally improved over the last 25 years. Over 99.8% of drinking water samples meet national standards in the UK,192 Northern Ireland Water achieved its best ever drinking water quality in 2017, and public health problems related to water supply and sanitation are now a rare occurrence. 
The UK also provides people across the world with access to clean water, improves sanitation or supports hygiene promotion interventions. Current trends indicate that the UK is on track to meet its 2015 commitment to help over 60 million people gain access to water and sanitation by 2020,193 generating important co-benefits in the areas of health, school attendance, nutrition and gender equality.
This chapter sets out the UK’s approach to ensuring safe and affordable drinking water and sanitation; improving water quality; and improving efficiency and strengthening management of water resources while protecting and restoring water-related ecosystems. Internationally, progress on Goal 6 can underpin the achievement of many other Goals, including for example on good health and well-being (Goal 3).
Leave No One Behind examples:
• All water companies in England and Wales now offer Social Tariffs. The economic regulator of the water sector in England and Wales, Ofwat, carried out a price review in 2019 and all water companies must now set out a detailed business plan outlining how they will meet the needs of their customers from 2020 to 2025 and beyond. At least two water companies have committed to eradicate water poverty in their regions. The government-mandated WaterSure tariff also caps customer bills at the regional average for qualifying customers. Water UK’s summary reveals that by 2025, 1.4 million customers will receive help with their bills. 
• The Scottish Government is committed to average water charges rising by less than inflation in the period 2015-21. For low income households, help is available with up to 25% reduction in water and sewerage bills, linked to the Council Tax Reduction Scheme. 

Action in the UK
Access to safe and affordable drinking water and adequate sanitation (6.1, 6.2)
Today over 99.8% of UK drinking water samples meet applicable national standards.194 According to the World Health Organization and UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and 
Sanitation, 96% of the UK has access to safe water.195 Public health problems related to water supply and sanitation are now a rare event. UK law prevents water companies from being able to cut off customers’ supplies, water and sewage connections.
Despite these positive headline figures there remains a challenge on access and affordability for some of the more vulnerable sections of society. All water companies must manage customer debt and ability-topay issues. Relevant national legislation (including the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992) requires employers to provide access to adequate facilities for workers including toilets, washing, eating and drinking facilities. 
The UK is working to make it easier for people to access clean drinking water at refill points whilst reducing plastic waste (see also Goals 12 and 14). There are now over 14,000 refill points on City to Sea’s free Refill app and they aim to double this by 2020.196 
 
Activity snapshot: 
Water UK, which represents water companies, is committed to expanding the areas covered by the app to areas outside of city centres and including more options for rural communities.
The UK has a successful system for the provision of clean water and sanitation services and every day over 11 billion litres of waste water197 are collected by over 624,200 kilometres of sewers in the UK. In England and Wales these services are mainly provided by water companies and regulated by Ofwat, the Environment Agency or Natural Resources Wales and the Drinking Water Inspectorate.
Water companies can decide whether to bring forward a social tariff as part of a coherent package of support to enable customers to pay their bills. Other support can include help with metering, payment methods, debt advice and water efficiency measures. The Consumer Council for Water has continued to work with water companies to expand and increase awareness of the help available. At the end of 2017-18 there were 393,143 customers in England and Wales receiving help through social tariffs, a 51% increase on 2016-17 and an increase of 191% from 2015-16.198 The WaterSure scheme also enables water suppliers to cap bills for those low-income customers who are using a lot of water for essential family or health reasons (also Goal 1). The Digital Economy Act 2017, which allows data sharing between water companies and other organisations (including UK government departments such as the Department for Work and Pensions) will make it easier to identify and provide support to vulnerable customers who might need help with their bills.

Water efficiency (6.4)
Since 1994 water leakage in England and Wales has fallen by a third.199 Further progress has slowed in recent years, and in 2017-18 leakage remained at around 22% of supply (approximately 3 billion litres of water per day in England and Wales or 123 litres per day per property).200 The UK government has given a clear message that water companies must do more to reduce leakage in the long term. Water companies have since proposed an average leakage reduction of 16% by 2025. The water industry has also committed to reducing leakage by 50% by 2050. This would reduce overall leakage to 10% of supply.201  
Activity snapshot: 
Albion Water formed a joint venture with 
Wessex Water Limited in September 2016 and installed dual water supply infrastructure - designed to meet both potable (water that is safe to drink) water and non-potable quality requirements - in new communities in Gloucestershire and Essex. The first completed dual system housing development in Upper Rissington provided potable networks delivering below 90 litres per day (an average reduction in flows through the potable network of 30%).
The Data Picture: Water industry leakage
Coverage: England and Wales
Reductions in leakages in the water supply network will contribute to improvements in water efficiency (Global Target 6.4). Leakage rates in England and Wales fell rapidly between 1994/95 and 2000/01 but have remained at just over 3 billion litres per day since then. 
Water industry leakage: 1993/94 to 2017/18 Source: Defra, Water Conservation Report 2018 Since 1999/2000, household water consumption in England has decreased from 150 litres per person per day to 141 in 2017/18. This is slightly up from the 2015/16 average of 139 litres per person per day.  A call for evidence will be launched in 2019 on setting an ambitious target for personal water consumption alongside a consultation on the policy options required to support this target.
The Data Picture: Household water consumption
Coverage: England
Reductions in household water consumption will contribute to improvements in water efficiency (Global Target 6.4). Between 1999/00 and 2015/16, average daily household water consumption in England fell from 150 litres per capita to 139 litres per capita. It has risen slightly since then to 141 litres per capita in 2017/18.

Sustainable water management (6.3, 6.5, 6.6, 6.b)
River Basin Management plans (RBMPs) are strategies for managing the UK water environment. They are the main vehicle for achieving the water quality ambition set out in the UK government’s 25 Year Environment Plan: to return, as soon as practicable, at least threequarters of waters to close to their natural state. The current 2015 RBMPs confirmed over £3 billion of investment in the water environment over six years. In England over 5,000km of surface water has been enhanced, moving towards the target of 8,600km by 2021.202   
An abstraction plan is being implemented to make sure a more sustainable level of water is taken from the environment. This adopts a more catchment-focussed approach to facilitate improved trading and sharing of water resources whilst reducing pressure on fragile habitats. A report was laid before the UK Parliament in 2019 to demonstrate the progress made under the plan since 2017.203  
Over the last 30 years, there has been good progress on water quality after more than a century of poorly regulated industrial practices. England now has consistently high levels of clean bathing waters, serious pollution incidents are declining and rivers that were biologically dead are reviving. There have been huge strides made since the early 1990s, when just 28% of bathing waters in England met the top water quality standards that were then in force. In 2018, 97.9% of bathing waters tested at over 400 beaches and lakes across England passed the applicable standards.204
However, challenges remain. For example, while nitrate levels in rivers and lakes are declining steadily, the British Geological Society estimates this decline will not be mirrored in groundwaters for another 60 years due in some cases to the time lapse as nitrate moves through the strata to the aquifer.205 Phosphorus levels in rivers have been decreasing since the mid-1990s, in parallel with improvements at sewage treatment works. However, phosphates remain the principal reason for rivers not achieving good status.206 
While the number of serious pollution incidents in England fell to 419 in 2017, down 18% on 2016207 challenges such as diffuse pollution and overabstraction remain. Updated 2015 RBMPs include new rules for farmers to tackle diffuse pollution and introduced Countryside Stewardship, a £400 million agri-environment scheme in England for 201420. Water companies are also complementing this investment with £3.5 billion over 2014-19. Domestic and European law requires the Environment Agency to review and update RBMPs by the end of 2021. Water infrastructure investment (6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.6)
The UK government is developing a national policy statement (NPS) in 2019 for water resources infrastructure, to support the delivery of nationallysignificant water resources infrastructure including water transfers, reservoirs and desalination plants. The NPS will assist and streamline the planning process for the development of large water resources infrastructure to meet water supply needs. 
The water industry has invested more than £150 billion in infrastructure over the last 30 years.208 It is delivering a £44 billion investment programme over 2015-20 and companies have proposed investing a further £50 billion across 2020-25. Part of this investment includes the Thames Tideway Tunnel, or the London super sewer, which will capture almost all of the 18 million tonnes of sewage that currently overflows into the River Thames each year. Protecting the Thames from sewage will significantly improve the river’s water quality and biodiversity. It will also boost economic growth across the capital, generating thousands of jobs and bringing social benefits. The Thames Tideway Tunnel will be the largest project of its type in Europe and will be operational by 2023.
Water and wastewater planning by water companies (6.4, 6.5) and stakeholder and community engagement (6.b)
Water companies are expected to assess demand management and new supply options in the light of future challenges, such as the environmental needs set out in RBMPs, population growth and climate change. Water companies should see what solutions provide for resilient water supplies while offering best value to customers in the longer term. Water companies must consult on their plans. 
The UK government is looking at legislative changes that would improve collaboration in water resources planning between water companies and other  water-using sectors. It is also looking to strengthen  the legislative framework to make the current  non-statutory drainage and wastewater planning process a statutory requirement.
Communities and voluntary organisations are also now being engaged in the planning and practical delivery of environmental outcomes. The Catchment Based Approach is an example of where an integrated approach to local community engagement is delivering cost-effective improvements to the water environment. Partnerships work to embed a more strategic, catchment-wide approach to managing water, water resources and flood risk whilst also generating a range of other social and economic benefits. 
Scotland
Scotland is committed to being a ‘Hydro Nation’ where Scotland’s water environment is managed to best advantage and Scotland’s knowledge and expertise is applied at home and internationally. Clean water and sanitation (6.1, 6.2)
Universal access to safe and clean water and access to sanitation are met in Scotland. Publicly-owned Scottish Water provide water and waste water services. Around 3.6% of Scotland’s population are served by private water supplies and approximately 7% by private sewerage arrangements.209 Local authorities regulate private water supplies with oversight by the Drinking Water Quality Regulator for Scotland. Where there is an emergency, such as in the summer of 2018, local authorities and Scottish Water work together to provide emergency supplies of water to homes and businesses served by private supplies.
The importance of water to Scotland’s well-being and economy is recognised in legislation: the Water Resources (Scotland) Act 2013 places a duty on Scottish Ministers to develop the value of water resources in a responsible way.
Actions to make progress on this Goal include:
• ‘Your Water, Your Life’ campaign, launched in June 2018 to encourage people to use refillable bottles and top up from the tap to improve Scotland’s health and environmental footprint;
• Joining the international trend of Blue-Green cities, bringing water management and green infrastructure together to provide high quality places for public amenity and help reduce flooding; and
• Scotland is one of 12 pilot countries testing the Indicator Framework to measure, test and take action to collectively strengthen water policies.
Scottish Water is taking specific action in rural areas, including trials on small community supply water treatment technologies. Research is being conducted to help build criteria for identifying rural communities that are most in need of water infrastructure support.
Quality of water bodies and participation in water management (6.3, 6.4, 6.6, 6.b)
The current condition of water bodies in Scotland is improving, however a wide range of pressures are continuing to impact on the condition of a small number of water bodies and protected areas. Improvement measures to raise 87% of water bodies to ‘good’ status by 2027 are prioritised through RBMPs. There is also continued effort to prevent deterioration of water bodies from ‘high’ and ‘good’ status. 
The risk of flooding remains a concern. 108,000 properties are at risk of flooding, 73% of them residential with £252 million expected annual flood damage in the 2016-2021 period.210 The Flood Risk Management (Scotland) Act 2009 has led to a range of flood risk management strategies being implemented between 2016 and 2021. Taking a catchment-scale approach and action based on risk-based decisions there are 42 prioritised flood protection schemes across the strategies that will reduce the risk of flooding in communities.
2020 has been designated the Year of Coasts and Waters in Scotland, that will spotlight and promote opportunities to experience and enjoy Scotland’s natural assets responsibly.
Wales
Water is one of Wales’s greatest natural assets and an integral part of Welsh culture, heritage and national identity. In 2015 Welsh Government published the Water Strategy for Wales which aims is to ensure a more integrated and sustainable approach to managing water and associated services in Wales. 
Activity snapshot: 
The not-for profit Glas Cymru owns and manages Dwr Cymru/Welsh Water and because it has no shareholders, any financial surpluses are retained for the benefit of Welsh Water’s customers. Welsh Water 2050 sets out its long-term vision which will help address the many challenges that lie ahead - from climate and demographic change to the pace of technological change and also to increasing customer expectations. 
The document details 18 strategic responses to respond to these challenges. Its vision is set within the policy context of the Welsh Government’s Well-being of Future Generations Act (Wales) 2015 and Environment Act (Wales) 2015.
Access to safe and affordable drinking water and adequate sanitation (6.1, 6.2) 
Wales is served by two water companies, Dwr Cymru/
Welsh Water and Hafren Dyfrdwy. Approximately 80,000 people rely on a private water supply. The two water companies operate a number of water treatment plants and distribution networks which treat and convey water and ensure that it is of an appropriate standard for public consumption. In 2017, the figure for public water supply compliance with the Drinking Water Directive in Wales was 99.96%. For private supply it was 95.3% which is at the highest compliance level since introducing drinking water standards.211  
Affordability is a key priority as set out in the Welsh Strategic Priorities Statement to Ofwat. It is expected that social tariffs will be available for those who struggle to pay and for companies and Ofwat  to consider the appropriate balance between  short-term affordability and the need to safeguard future generations. 
There are now over 160,000 people in Wales benefitting from social tariffs in Wales.
Water quality (6.3)
Water quality has improved dramatically over the last 25 years with all 104 Welsh designated bathing waters meeting the minimum EU standard.212
In Wales, 37% of water bodies and achieving good status under the Water Framework Directive.213 There are a number of reasons why water bodies are failing to meet good status including agricultural pollution, legacy abandoned metal mines and Water Company discharges. 
The Metal Mine Strategy for Wales looks to restore rivers back to health. Natural Resources Wales (NRW) is leading on a metal mine remediation programme for Wales with support from the Coal Authority.
According to NRW, the water quality in rivers has generally improved over the last 25 years, mainly as a result of improvements to sewage discharges. Furthermore, upland lakes and rivers show sustained recovery from the harmful effects of acid rain. 

Activity snapshot: 
Working for Natural Resources Wales, Mott MacDonald provided design services for the demolition and removal of Aberfan Weir in the River Taff in south Wales. The project improved the river ecosystem and delivered wider sustainable economic improvements. For example, access to over 10km of good quality fish spawning ground and juvenile habitat was delivered as part of the project, helping to secure the future sustainability of migratory fish stocks on the river, which will help support the important fishing tourism economy in Wales.
Water efficiency (6.4) 
Wales’s not-for-profit water company, Dwr Cymru/ Welsh Water (DCWW), have delivered the biggest leakage percentage reduction in the industry over the last five years.214 This has been achieved by applying innovation, better use of analytics and metering, and smart network management. A 15% reduction in the volume of leakage is planned by 2025.
Water efficiency is also encouraged through longstanding behavioural change campaigns, and free meter installation.
Amendments have been made to the Building Regulations in Wales to introduce a new requirement that where a dwelling is erected the potential consumption of wholesome water by persons must not exceed 110 litres per person per day.
Water resources management (6.3, 6.5, 6.6) 
Unlike the rest of the UK, Wales does not have groundwater supplies, and must therefore try to capture and store most water in reservoirs. To ensure robust and resilient water resources, Wales is proposing to change the current abstraction licensing system in conjunction with the UK government.
The Welsh Government has introduced legislation to make it a requirement for new developments to be built in accordance with statutory standards for Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS). SuDS aim to manage rainfall in a way similar to natural processes making use of the landscape and natural vegetation to control the flow and volume of surface water. SuDS can improve the management of Wales’s water environment leading to reduced flood risk, improved water quality and enhanced biodiversity.
Participation of local communities in water and sanitation management (6.b)
During the development of Welsh Water 2050, DCWW engaged and consulted with relevant stakeholders to ensure their informed views were captured and helped shape the final form of the document.
The water companies in Wales carry out extensive consumer research and engagement in the development of their business plans. In the Strategic Priorities Statement to Ofwat Wales set out a clear objective in respect of customer and stakeholder priorities in shaping business plans.
Northern Ireland
Northern Ireland Water is a Government Owned Company which provides water and sewerage services in Northern Ireland including 570 million litres of clean water a day for almost 1.8 million people as well as treating 340 million litres of wastewater a day.215
In 2017 Northern Ireland Water achieved its best-ever drinking water quality and also achieved its target for wastewater compliance.
The Northern Ireland Department of Agriculture, 
Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) publishes Water Framework Directive (WFD) Statistics relating to water quality in Northern Ireland every three years. The 2018 WFD Statistics report indicated that 31.3% of 450 river water bodies were classified as ‘high’ or ‘good’ quality, compared to 32.7% in 2015. The report also indicated that 10 of 25 marine water bodies were classified at 
‘high’ or ‘good’ status compared to 9 classified at ‘high’ or ‘good’ status in 2015.216
DAERA’s new agricultural-environment scheme, the Environmental Farming Scheme (EFS) aims to address specific environmental needs, primarily related to biodiversity and water quality. The scheme, one of DAERA’s largest with a projected budget of £112 million up to 2025, opened for applications in 2017.  As of March 2019, there are 3,111 agreements in place and further application tranches are planned.
DAERA is considering further options aimed at improving water quality through reducing nutrient levels in waterbodies including excess phosphorus. Monitoring data (from 2017) published in May 2018 shows that soluble reactive phosphorus (P) in rivers is rising. Whilst the increase is marginal, it is a cause for concern that there are early signs of an upward trend despite the measures deployed by the department to reduce pollution from agricultural sources. It is highly likely that pressures will increase in 2018 due to low grass yields and an observed increase in the use of concentrate feeds. Northern Ireland data on winter dissolved inorganic nitrogen show a potential decrease on the 2015 baseline year.217 However, further years of data are required to assess whether this is a positive trend.
Activity snapshot: 
Northern Ireland Water has worked with RSPB and Northern Ireland Environment Agency on an award-winning project to protect and restore peatland at the Garron Plateau in the Antrim Hills. The area is the largest expanse of intact blanket bog in Northern Ireland and its value has been recognised both nationally and internationally. It helped to restore habitats and enhanced water quality by natural filtration through the peat and vegetation.
Representatives from across the water sector in Northern Ireland are currently working with colleagues from across central and local government, with support from the private sector, to develop a Strategic Drainage Plan for Belfast which will protect Belfast from flooding, enhance the environment and enable the city to grow.
UK action around the world
Access to safe and affordable drinking water and sanitation internationally (6.1, 6.2), water security and transboundary management (6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6) and international cooperation and capacity building (6.a)
The UK contributes to delivery of Goal 6 around the world through the UK government’s Department for International Development (DFID) investments in water and sanitation programmes at country level, and through support to the global architecture and influencing on water and sanitation at international level. 
The UK promotes safe and affordable drinking water and sanitation by funding water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) through bilateral programmes in 28 countries. In addition, UK core contributions to multilateral development bodies, primarily the World Bank and African Development Bank, support WASH. Between 2015 and 2018, the UK helped 40.3 million people gain access to water and sanitation.218  Current forecasts indicate that the UK will have helped over 60 million people gain access by 2020. 
In order to Leave No One Behind, the UK runs international programmes that focus on those people who continue to lack access to water and sanitation, with a focus on the poorest. Work on WASH has focussed on rural areas because this is where the needs are typically greatest. The UK works to address the rights of women and girls to access WASH services; women and girls need safe, private, hygienic and convenient WASH facilities, and good WASH facilities are also necessary for menstrual hygiene. Results are disaggregated by gender and programmes now increasingly collect data disaggregated by disability. UKfunded programmes have ensured that at least 13.7 million women and girls were provided with access to WASH between 2015 and 2018.219

The South Asia WASH (Water, Hygiene and Sanitation) Results Programmes (SWARP) is operated by a consortium led by Plan International UK and funded by DFID.  
The other members of the consortium are WSUP (Water and Sanitation for the Urban Poor), WEDC, WaterAid, Unilever and Ipsos. The seven-year programme (2014-21) aims to deliver sustainable access to safe water and sanitation and encourage the adoption of basic hygiene practices in Pakistan and Bangladesh. To date the programme has: improved water access for 359,475 people; reached over two million people with improved sanitation; and delivered access to soap and improved handwashing for over seven million people.
The UK supports the global architecture related to Goal 6 to provide robust evidence for decision-making and support countries in developing strategies for financing and delivering sustainable services. This includes support to the Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP), the Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking water programme (GLAAS), and the Sanitation and Water for All partnership (SWA). 
UK water security and transboundary water management programmes are contributing to Goal 6. For example, the UK’s Water Security Programme has supported over 23 million  people to become more resilient to climate change, by improving sustainable access to quality water resources and reducing  water-related risks such as floods and droughts.220   The UK is helping build cooperation within transboundary river basins in Central and South Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa.
The UK’s work on this Goal is supported by its  wide-ranging expertise. The UK has a unique set of centres of excellence on water and sanitation, including the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the Universities of Leeds, Oxford, Loughborough, East Anglia and University College London. UK consulting companies have world-class engineering, science and management expertise which is sought by governments and agencies across the world. Nongovernmental organisations (NGOs) such as WaterAid, Oxfam and Plan are key partners in delivering WASH programmes.
Other UK institutions such as the British Geological Society contribute vital expertise to research programmes such as Unlocking the Potential of Groundwater for the Poor (UPGro), funded by DFID, the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC). The UK is also working with the Met Office and other partners in Yemen to improve the forecasting of where cholera is likely to occur, to enable earlier preparedness and action.
Activity snapshot: 
British water engineering company, Biwater, have been awarded a US$1.2 billion contract by the Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraq to meet vital water supply and sanitation needs. 
 
As a part of this project, Erbil will be provided with a 600,000 m3/day state-of-the-art water treatment plant, while Sulaimani will benefit from water treatment plant upgrades and the construction of cutting-edge wastewater treatment works and sludge treatment facilities. 
 
The loan for the development works is being financed by UK Export Finance (UKEF). J.P. Morgan is acting as the Facility Agent and Mandated Lead Arranger for this initial loan on behalf of UKEF to the Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraq.
Challenges and next steps
Climate change, population growth and changes in consumer behaviour are putting increasing pressure on the water sector in England. The UK government is committed to a twin track approach to securing resilient water supplies, which requires both new water resources infrastructure and further action to reduce the demand for water. 
Collaborative working at the river catchment scale is beginning to demonstrate real improvements in tackling diffuse pollution and improving water quality. As a result, this way of working is being extended to other challenges such as managing water abstraction and working with natural processes to deliver flood risk management.
Resilient water supplies
Resilience to climate extremes is a challenge and there is a strong linkage to actions and challenges in Goal 13. Reducing water consumption is both a challenge and next step. Scottish Water will promote increased water efficiency, reduce energy consumption in water and waste water services and produce renewable energy from water resources and assets.
Northern Ireland Water Limited continues to enhance the existing network to meet new demand and upgrade the existing infrastructure to ensure sustained service delivery and environmental performance. It aims to become more resilient and sustainable to meet future challenges, for example from climate change and a growing and ageing population. Sustainable Water – A Long Term Water Strategy for Northern Ireland (2015-2040) presents a clear framework for action which will facilitate implementation of a range of initiatives aimed at delivering the long-term vision to have a sustainable water sector in Northern Ireland.
Different parts of the UK can face very different weather conditions. Some areas suffer significant levels of water stress which put the health of the freshwater environment at risk; climate change is likely to exacerbate this along with population growth in areas where water is already scarce. There has been an increasing focus on reforming the licensing regime for water abstraction in recent years. The UK government is implementing an Abstraction Plan to put withdrawals onto a more sustainable level. A catchment-focussed approach aims to facilitate improved trading and sharing of water resources whilst reducing pressure on the most fragile habitats.

Goal 7: Affordable and Clean Energy
Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all
Summary 
The UK is committed to making sure consumers have secure, affordable and clean energy now and in the future. Since 2015, the UK has taken great strides towards achieving Goal 7; leading the world in decarbonising its economy, cutting emissions from electricity generation, and phasing out coal power.221 This has been thanks to a combination of public sector policies, private sector innovation and a population passionate about accelerating this transition. Alongside this, the UK is working on making energy affordable for all and sustained improvements in energy efficiency have seen energy bills for the average household in the UK fall. 
The UK’s ambition is to meet its climate change commitments at the lowest possible cost to British taxpayers, consumers and businesses, while being at the forefront of clean technologies and maximising the social and economic benefits of the global shift to clean growth. This is being achieved through the UK government’s Clean Growth Strategy and Industrial Strategy, and through actions across the UK at local, regional and national level. Internationally, the UK played a leading role in the signing of the Paris Climate Agreement in 2015 and continues to drive collective action towards cleaner energy for all.
This chapter looks at the steps taken throughout the UK to deliver affordable and efficient energy to all; maintain a secure energy supply; and transition to sustainable energy. Although significant progress has been made since 2015, further action is planned to replicate success in the power sector by cutting emissions from transport and heating and ensuring fuel poverty is effectively tackled.
Meeting the promise to Leave No One Behind 
• Improving the energy efficiency of homes is the best long-term solution to tackling fuel poverty. The Energy Company Obligation (ECO) is supported by £640 million in funding per year and has delivered around 2.5 million energy efficiency measures to 2 million between January 2013 and February 2019. The new scheme, which launched in 2018, is now exclusively focussed on low income and vulnerable households across Great Britain.
• The Scottish Government’s Warmer Homes Scotland fuel poverty programme assisted 4,903 households in 2017/18, each of them saving an average of £318 a year off their energy bills. 
• The Welsh Government’s Warm Homes programme delivers action to support people on low incomes struggling to meet the cost of their home energy needs, including those in or at risk of fuel poverty. It includes the demand-led Nest scheme and area-based Arbed scheme. A ‘whole-house’ approach to improving the energy efficiency of homes eligible for measures under the schemes is taken. It is focussed on people most in need of additional support to maintain a safe and comfortable home environment. 
• The RECENT project aims to help dispersed rural communities in Northern Ireland develop their own community-led energy enterprise, enabling them to take control of their own energy security and reinvest any potential profits back into the local community. The project also developed an online learning portal allowing the lessons from the project to be shared across Europe.

Action in the UK 
Delivering affordable and efficient energy  
(7.1, 7.3)  
Improving the energy efficiency of buildings not only cuts emissions, it can help slash energy bills too – between 2010 and 2018, energy bills for the average household in the UK fell by 14% in real terms.222 
Tenants in England and Wales living in Band F and G rated homes will save on average £180 per year due to the new Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards for privately rented homes, which require landlords to improve properties to at least Band E or seek an exemption.
The Domestic Gas and Electricity (Tariff Cap) Act 2018 also introduced a ‘price cap’ on the rates that energy suppliers can charge consumers on standard variable and default energy tariffs. The price cap came into effect in January 2019 and will save the average dualfuel (gas and electricity) consumer in the UK around £75 to £100 per year.223
In the UK, fuel poverty is devolved; each nation has powers to set their own target and strategy.  In England, the fuel poverty target is to improve fuel poor homes to energy efficiency Band C by 2030.  An updated fuel poverty strategy for England is expected by 2020. Under the Warm Home Discount Scheme, 2 million low income and fuel poor households benefit from a rebate of £140 off their energy bills each winter.224 £2.4 billion of assistance has been provided to these households up to winter 2018/19.225
Activity snapshot: 
In England the Public Sector Loan Scheme provides interest-free loans to the wider public and higher education sectors (excluding Central Government) to install energy efficiency measures. As of 2017/18 Salix Finance, the loan scheme administrator, manages £240 million and this will rise to £385 million by 2020. To date, the loan scheme has funded over 17,000 projects. 
The smart meter rollout across England, Scotland and Wales will lay the foundation for a cheaper, cleaner and more efficient energy system and is essential for getting more out of low carbon technologies like electric vehicles and electric heating, and more energy from renewable sources. As of 31 March 2019, there were over 14.3 million smart and advanced meters 
in operation.226 On a larger scale, the £18 million Industrial Heat Recovery Support programme and the £315 million Industrial Energy Transformation Fund are supporting industry to use heat more efficiently. 
Activity snapshot: 
In July 2017 the UK government and Ofgem, the government regulator, jointly published the Smart Systems & Flexibility Plan, outlining 29 actions for UK government, Ofgem and industry take to remove barriers to smart technologies, enable smart homes and businesses, and improve access to energy markets for new technologies and business models. These actions are designed to reduce the costs of the energy system and help keep energy bills low for consumers. 
Maintaining a secure energy supply (7.1) 
The UK has very high levels of energy security. It works with a range of sectors to ensure that the energy supply is balanced – with a diverse range of supply sources and sufficient delivery capacity to meet demand – and can respond effectively to changes affecting that balance. 
The Capacity Market, introduced by the UK government in 2014, enables Great Britain to maintain security of supply at the lowest cost to consumers, by providing a level playing field for all technologies and the right investment signals for a mix of capacity. Work towards an increase in interconnection capacity continues, by ensuring a stable regime under which interconnector developers can bring forward projects to enable access to cheaper electricity from Europe at times of peak demand. The UK is also investing in a wide range of innovative technologies to ensure it can maintain secure supplies while cutting emissions in future.
Transitioning to sustainable energy (7.2)  
The UK leads the G20 in cutting emissions while delivering sustained economic growth, largely due to rapid progress transitioning from fossil fuels to low carbon and renewable alternatives.227 Almost 53% of the electricity powering homes and businesses in the UK in 2018 came from clean sources, including 33% from renewables.228 Coal’s share was only 5%, continuing strong progress towards the commitment to completely phase out its use by 2025.229 
Activity snapshot: 
Established in 2017, the Green Finance 
Taskforce brought together some of the 
UK’s sharpest minds and worked with over 150 organisations to produce a set of widereaching and ambitious recommendations to accelerate the growth of green finance. After the publication of their report, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced the establishment of a new Green Finance Institute, in partnership with the City of London, which will drive forward the UK’s Green Finance market, and the 
UK will publish a Green Finance Strategy in 2019. 

A collective effort across society has been crucial to this, with over £92 billion invested in clean energy in the UK between 2010 and 2018, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.230 As of May 2019, there were more than 100 green bonds listed on the London Stock Exchange, raising over US$26 billion.231 
This investment has enabled the UK to have the largest offshore wind capacity in the world, with 34% of global capacity in 2018, and ensured the UK remains a world leader in innovation.232 The world’s first floating wind farm opened off the coast of Scotland in 2017 and the UK has allocated up to £557 million for future Contracts for Difference auctions, a commitment which could see offshore wind contributing up to 30GW of generating capacity by 2030. 
The UK has also invested in technologies and approaches to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from heating. The Renewable Heat Incentive is expected to save approximately 137 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) of greenhouse gas emissions over the course of its lifetime and £320 million is going towards a flagship Heat Networks Investment Project.233  
In the Road to Zero Strategy and the Automotive Sector Deal, the UK government and industry have set out how together they will deliver the UK’s transition to low carbon vehicles. This includes £1.5 billion in public investment until 2021, an £108 million national battery scale-up facility, and actions on deployment, design, manufacture, and infrastructure.
After receiving advice from the Committee on Climate Change, an independent, statutory body established under the Climate Change Act 2008 to provide expert advice to government on climate change mitigation and adaptation, the UK government has laid draft legislation to set a new net zero greenhouse gas emissions target for the UK, to be delivered by 2050. This world-leading target will end the UK’s contribution to climate change. 
Activity snapshot: 
The UK hosted the first annual Green Great Britain Week to celebrate UK leadership and showcase the benefits and opportunities of clean growth. In association, environmental website, edie, created a Mission Possible Pledge Wall on its platform to highlight the commitment from business towards a sustainable future. Example pledges include HSBC’s UK Pension Scheme investing £250 million in solar and wind energy and EDF Energy committing to electrifying their fleet (currently 1,500 vehicles) by 2030.

Energy efficiency and decarbonisation (7.2, 7.3) 
Scotland’s ambition to be a world leader in affordable and clean energy is shared across the public, private and third sectors. This ambition is being progressed through legislation, local and national government policy, community action and a focus on corporate sustainability.
Heating and cooling Scotland’s homes and businesses costs £2.6 billion a year236 and accounts for approximately half of Scotland’s greenhouse gas emissions.237 Scotland’s 20-year delivery programme – Energy Efficient Scotland – is a strategic partnership between national and local government to improve the use and management of energy in buildings and help decarbonise the heat supply. The programme also supports area-based schemes that reinforce local energy efficiency measures to lift people out of fuel poverty.
The discussion paper on Decarbonising Scotland’s Industrial Sector and Sites identifies barriers to investment in decarbonisation, references support available and sets out the next steps to create an improved Scottish support framework.
Transport’s percentage share of total net emissions has increased in recent years as non-transport emissions have fallen. Actions for ‘electrification’ of Scotland’s roads to support the target of no new petrol or diesel cars and vans by 2032 include a network of charge points in homes, businesses and communities;  interest-free loans for purchase of low emission vehicles; and low emission zones transforming towns and cities into cleaner, healthier places to live, work and visit.
The Data Picture: Transport 
Emissions
Coverage: Scotland
Transport (including international aviation and shipping) accounted for 14.4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, representing 37.3% of net greenhouse gas emissions in Scotland in 2016. Within transport emissions, road transportation accounts for around 68% of the transportation total. Transport’s percentage share of total net emissions has increased in recent years as non-transport emissions have fallen.

Fintry, in rural Stirlingshire, entered into a jointventure agreement with a wind farm developer that secured a wind turbine for the community. With the income stream that generates, Fintry has given free insulation to more than half of the households in the village and is now embarking on new ambitious projects to make the village carbon-neutral.
Wales 
Affordable, reliable and modern energy services 
(7.1, 7.3)
Wales’s highest priority is to reduce energy demand wherever possible and affordable. Expectations are that overall power demand will increase as a result of growing electrification of transport.238 To ensure future demand can be met, significant investment will be needed in low carbon energy generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure.
Between 2011 and March 2018, Wales invested more than £248 million in the Warm Homes Programme to improve the energy efficiency of over 50,800 homes throughout Wales, making them warmer and more affordable to heat.
Between 2016 and 2018, Wales invested £44.5 million and secured a further £5.7 million from the Energy Company Obligation. During this period, 11,000 homes were improved, and 29,000 households were provided free impartial advice. The percentage of households in Wales in fuel poverty has reduced from 29% in 2012 to 23% in 2016.239 
Good energy performance in housing reduces energy demand in the domestic sector and helps homeowners and tenants manage the costs of maintaining a warm home. The Welsh Housing Quality Standard for existing social housing includes achieving an energy efficiency standard of Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP) 65 or higher. This is the equivalent to Energy Performance Certificates (EPC) D rating on a scale of A to G. 
Currently 200,431 (89%) social homes have achieved SAP 65 or higher and work will continue on this up to and beyond 2020.240
  
Low carbon energy (7.2)
Wales’s Low Carbon Delivery Plan sets out the ambition for low carbon electricity to become the main source of energy in Wales. Affordable and low carbon energy is a key objective to achieving prosperity in Wales.241  
The Welsh Government accepted the Committee on Climate Change’s recommendation for a 95% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and wants to reach net zero. Wales aims for 70% of electricity consumption to be met from renewable sources by 2030. Wales also has a target for 1 GW of renewable energy capacity in Wales to be locally owned by 2030; and an expectation for all new renewable energy projects to have at least an element of local ownership from 2020. In 2018, Wales held a call for evidence on the benefits of, and challenges in, increasing locally-owned energy generation and delivering the 1 GW local ownership target. It demonstrated that increasing local ownership of energy generation within Wales is likely to increase prosperity.242  
Approximately 22% of total electricity generated in Wales in 2017 was from renewables.243 Wales is a net exporter of electricity, the electrical generation potential from renewable energy installations in 2017 was estimated to be equivalent to 48% of Welsh electricity consumption.244
Activity snapshot: 
Based in Wales, Shotwick Solar Park is the largest solar park in the UK at 72.2 Mega Watts (MW). It has a private wire connecting it directly to Shotton Paper Mill, offsetting roughly one third of their annual electricity demand and saving 22,500 tonnes of carbon per year. It also has a grid export capacity of 50 MW. The site was developed by British Solar Renewables, WeLink Energy and Compton Group and is now owned by Foresight Group.

Regional and local energy planning is being taken forward to accelerate the deployment of renewable generation in Wales. The installation of renewable energy generation capacity has increased in pace in recent years with the capacity of technologies such as solar panels more than doubling from 2014-16, and onshore wind capacity showing a 50% increase.245
This approach to energy planning also aims to encourage increased local ownership of energy developments. The Welsh Government has commissioned evidence on the potential resources in Wales for onshore and offshore wind and solar resource and is considering the implications of this work for spatial planning and infrastructure.
Wales has an opportunity to take advantage of its marine natural resources. Wales has established two demonstration zones, which provides testbed opportunities for wave and tidal stream devices. This industry has the potential to offer a global solution to decarbonising energy generation. It is already providing economic opportunities in deprived coastal areas in Wales. 
Wales has called for its public sector to be carbon neutral by 2030. This requires large scale delivery of renewable energy and energy efficiency projects within the public sector. To help deliver emissions savings, the Welsh Government considers carbon impact when allocating capital funding. All new health and education buildings funded through Welsh Government capital are designed and built to maximise energy efficiency. Funding is conditional on projects being designed to achieve an A rating on EPCs, as well as an excellent accreditation under the Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Methodology to demonstrate sustainability. 
As well as raising the standards for new buildings, Wales is developing a long-term retrofit programme for all existing homes. This will use innovative construction techniques, incorporating more use of sustainable materials, alongside existing fabric solutions to deliver more sustainable buildings with reduced energy demand (see Goal 9).
The Welsh Government Energy Service provides a comprehensive package of support to the public sector and communities to take forward projects providing local benefit. This includes help, advice and funding for early stages of development, through to access to capital funding. Wales Funding Programme and the Welsh Government Local Energy Fund are accessed via the service, and together provide loans, including low or interest-free loans, to support installation. The service is developing a pipeline of renewable energy and energy efficiency projects which are being delivered across Wales.
Activity snapshot: 
The National Trust’s 100 kW Berthen Hydro on the Afon Berthen has been supplying energy to 100 households in the town of Bethesda in an “Energy Local Club”. The trial uses price signals and communications to encourage householders to shift electricity usage to periods when the hydropower plant is generating, with resulting average bill savings of around 30%.
Northern Ireland 
The Greenhouse Gas Inventories for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland: 1990 – 2016 estimated the 2016 Northern Ireland emissions at 20.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (Mt CO2e); with 20% from energy supply. This indicates a decrease of 15.9% in overall greenhouse gas emissions in 2016 compared to the 1990 base year. The Strategic Energy Framework for Northern Ireland 2010 set a target of 40% of electricity consumption to be met from renewables by 2020. As of December 2018, the 12-month rolling average was 38%.246
UK action around the world 
Enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy (7.a)
The UK has been a driving force for collective action towards cleaner energy, playing a leading role in securing the agreement of 195 countries to sign up to the Paris Climate Agreement in 2015 and in delivering an operational rulebook to enable its effective implementation at the 2018 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP24). The rulebook will galvanise genuine climate action, providing a common set of rules while allowing flexibility for those countries that need it.
Activity snapshot: 
The business-led Emissions Trading Group (ETG) covers a wide range of commercial and industrial sectors that are large carbon emitters. The ETG offers a forum for discussion between industry and government for emissions trading, helping to shape the future direction of the Climate Change Agreements Scheme.
At the 2017 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP23), the UK, alongside Canada, launched the Powering Past Coal Alliance (PPCA), a voluntary coalition of national and sub-national governments, businesses and organisations. Through the PPCA, the UK has brought together stakeholders across the globe, united in their desire to phase out the most polluting fuel. The UK also hosted the world’s first Zero Emission Vehicle Summit in September 2018, bringing together representatives from over 40 countries to collaborate on a zero-emission future for transport around the world and accelerate investment in both zero-emission technology and infrastructure. 
Expand infrastructure and upgrade technology for supplying modern and sustainable energy services (7.b) 
An important component of the UK’s global effort has been supporting developing countries to expand their infrastructure and upgrade their technology for supplying modern and sustainable energy services (see Goal 9).
Since 2011, the UK’s International Climate Finance (ICF) has helped 17 million people access clean energy and installed 590 MW of clean energy capacity.247 This is helping to deliver universal access to affordable energy and provides support for climate mitigation and adaptation. As part of the Paris commitment, the UK pledged a further £5.8 billion of International Climate Finance (ICF) between 2016 and 2020. Over its lifetime, the ICF is expected to give 36 million people improved access to clean energy and deliver 5,800 MW of installed clean energy capacity.248
Low carbon technologies are often capital-intensive initially but the UK’s ICF is helping lower risk perceptions. It focusses on “transformational change” through targeted investment in innovative projects with the potential to be scaled up and replicated by others, and by tackling barriers that hold the private sector back from investing.

Challenges and next steps
Renewable energy
The UK has made significant progress decarbonising the power sector, but further action is needed to build on these gains, and to cut emissions from transport and heating in order to meet its legally binding carbon budgets. Transport is now the UK’s largest emitting sector and heat is responsible for around a third of UK emissions.250 These issues will be tackled through investment, technological breakthroughs, and collaboration between government, industry and consumers. In the power sector, the UK will continue  to invest in low carbon technologies and will publish  an Energy White Paper in the summer of 2019 to set out steps for ensuring the energy system is fit for  the future. 
The Annual Energy Statement sets out progress and future plans relevant to Goal 7. The decision of the Scottish Government to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045, following expert advice from the UK Committee on Climate Change, will further affect future plans and policies.
The Data Picture: Renewable 
Energy Consumption  
Coverage: UK
The UK has made steady progress increasing the proportion of renewables in the total energy consumption, averaging a 17% increase each year between 2013 and 2017. The largest gains have been made in electricity but more needs to be done in the transport sector, where progress has stalled, and also in decarbonising heat.

Energy innovation 
The UK must continue to develop new technologies and approaches to deliver a clean, low cost and reliable energy mix. The UK government is investing over £2.5 billion between 2015 and 2021 in energy innovation, covering technologies including Carbon Capture, Usage and Storage, low carbon heating, and hydrogen. A strong focus on innovation, including through work with international partners, will continue to be a core component of the UK’s strategy. 
In Wales, it is expected that overall power demand will increase as a result of growing electrification of transport. To ensure future demand can be met, significant investment is needed in energy generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure.
For Northern Ireland, greenhouse gas projections indicate that from early 2020s onwards and across 
all sectors, emissions will flatline or increase.251 The Committee on Climate Change released a report in February 2019 on the options, strategies, measures and schemes to reduce its greenhouse emissions in the 2020s. Northern Ireland is considering how to action these recommendations. Energy efficient housing and businesses
Already recognised as having made strong progress in energy efficient housing, the UK will do even more.252 Through the new Future Homes Standard and the Clean Growth Grand Challenge Buildings Mission, the UK will create a market for the next generation of buildings with low carbon heating and world-leading levels of energy efficiency. The Fuel Poverty Strategy will also be updated in 2020, setting out how all fuel poor homes will be upgraded to an energy efficiency rating of Energy Performance Certificate Band C by 2030. 
In 2017, 25% of households in Scotland were estimated to be in fuel poverty.253 The Scottish Parliament is currently considering proposed legislation that includes targets related to the eradication of  fuel poverty. 
Heating homes is a particular challenge in Wales, given the current dependence upon fossil fuels and the older, less energy-efficient housing stock. Local authorities are taking forward new approaches to decarbonising heat, with an aim to build the evidence base on the appropriate approaches to overcome the challenges in decarbonising the energy system. 
Homes are only part of the story and new regulations on Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting will help deliver the UK’s ambition for businesses to improve their energy productivity by 20% by 2030. 
EU exit 
The UK will continue to work closely with its EU partners to ensure continued cooperation in areas of mutual benefit, including security of energy supply and tackling climate change. Given geographic proximity, the UK and EU have a mutual interest in agreeing broad energy cooperation, including arrangements for trade in electricity and gas, cooperation with agencies and bodies, and data-sharing to facilitate market operations. Broad cooperation can lead to reduced emissions, lower energy bills, and increased security of supply, and will accelerate the transition to a low carbon economy and help to deliver both the UK’s and the EU’s energy and climate objectives.

Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth
Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all
Summary
Delivering shared prosperity, sustained economic growth, and productive work is a key pillar for a thriving society. The UK has taken positive steps on priorities, including championing small businesses, reforming the financial services sector, enhancing the role of women in work and building global links to enhance opportunities from international trade.
A major achievement is that employment and wage growth in the UK have recovered from the financial crisis. The unemployment rate has fallen to 3.8% (the joint lowest level since 1974),254 pay growth is at its strongest in over a decade,255 and real wages are rising,256 while inflation has fallen from its 2017 peak. 
Since 2015, there are 1.5 million more people in work in the UK, with 87% of this rise in employment being driven by people moving into full-time work.257 During this period the number of businesses in the UK has grown by over a quarter of a million.258 The UK is committed to deliver decent, productive work opportunities for all. There are over 700,000 more people with disabilities259 and 600,000 more people from ethnic minority backgrounds in work,260 in 2019 than in 2015. For full-time employees, the gender pay gap is at a record low (8.6%),261 reflecting progress towards Goal 5 (Gender Equality) and the promise to Leave No One Behind. The Race Disparity Audit (led by UK government) highlighted disparities in employment outcomes for people from different ethnic backgrounds. The UK has committed to take further action to address these disparities and the perceived lack of opportunity for groups with low social mobility. 
Despite progress on sustainable economic growth and promotion of decent work both in the UK and around the world, challenges remain such as improving productivity. Internationally, the evolving threat of modern slavery continues to demand action to tackle injustice and exploitation. 
This chapter explores the UK’s actions to boost economic growth, whilst ensuring financial inclusion and continuously addressing the impact on the environment. It highlights the interdependencies between this and activity supporting other Goals, such as to reduce inequalities (10) and peace, justice and strong Institutions (16). In the UK areas of economic growth policy such as education and skills are devolved, with each nation taking individual approaches on these issues.
Leave No One Behind examples: 
• Goal 8 cannot be met without promoting women in work. The female employment rate is at a record high of 71.8% and over 650,000 more women are in work since 2015. The gender pay gap is at a record low (17.9%). In 2017, the UK introduced gender pay gap reporting in Great Britain, requiring private and public sector employers to publish their figures annually. In 2018, 100% of employers in scope published their data. (See Goal 5 for more information on women in work.)
• Scotland is extending Fair Work criteria to as many funding streams, business support grants and public support grants as possible. Fair Work First is being developed with trade unions, business and the public sector and includes action relating to the gender pay gap, real Living Wage and inappropriate zero hours contracts.
• Wales is driving inclusive growth through maximising impact on the foundation sectors such as food, housing and energy and through a model of Regional Economic Development better attuned to tackling disparities amongst different parts of Wales. In Wales, disabled people are significantly less likely to be in work (47.3%). Whilst the disability employment rate has risen in recent years, a key priority is focussing efforts to achieve further progress to reduce economic inactivity, break the cycle of unemployment and increase poverty levels for disabled people. 

Action in the UK
Inclusive economic growth (8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.10)
The UK economy has grown every year since 2010.262 Since then, an average growth rate of 1.2% in gross domestic product (GDP) per capita has been maintained263, close to the G7 average of 1.4%.264 There has been strong economic growth and high levels of employment in recent years, with an annual growth rate of real GDP per employed person at 
0.739% in 2017 (up from 0.516% in 2016, and 
0.615% in 2015).265 GDP growth is forecast to be 
1.2% in 2019 and increase to 1.4% in 2020.266
The Data Picture: UK GDP and Pay,  real terms
Coverage: UK
GDP has recovered strongly since the financial crisis but more needs to be done to boost earnings. The National Living Wage supports wages for the lowest paid. Between 2015 and 2018, GDP has increased while average weekly pay has remained stable.

Small- and medium-sized businesses are vital to economic growth and employment in the UK,  and, measures to support businesses and promote small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have allowed firms to invest and grow. SMEs employed 660,000 more people in 2018 than 2015, representing 57% of the increase in private sector employment. Total employment in SMEs was 16.3 million at the start of 2018, accounting for 60% of all private sector employment in the UK.267
To make the most of everyone’s talents and maximise economic growth it is important that everyone has the same opportunities to start and grow businesses. To help promote further employment opportunities, the UK is creating shared growth by backing small businesses. Between 2012 and 2018, the British Business Bank’s Start-Up Loans Programme lent over £464 million to more than 60,000 entrepreneurs. 44% of Start-Up Loans recipients to date have been aged under 30; 41% were previously unemployed; 39% of loan recipients are women; and 22% of loans were issued to entrepreneurs from a Black or Minority Ethnic background.268
Activity snapshot: 
The Business Refugee Action Network 
(BRAN) seeks to improve the lives and economic opportunities of refugees, including through mobilising business to influence key national and global policy debates. Since 2018, twentythree different businesses have attended BRAN’s workshops. Businesses represented have included multinationals in the financial services, hospitality, consumer and manufacturing industries.  
 
BRAN fosters a culture of peer-led innovation in employing and developing goods and services for refugees. This is building the private sector’s capacity in responding to the current humanitarian crisis, thus creating a more comprehensive cross-sectoral response. BRAN also challenges negative narratives around refugees, contributing towards their social integration. Moreover, BRAN’s work is guided by impact-oriented research. A study commissioned by BRAN found investing one euro in welcoming refugees can yield nearly two euros in economic benefits within five years.
Financial Inclusion
Reform of financial services has also been a top priority following the 2008 financial crisis. Important steps have been taken to put an end to poor lending practice and269, to strengthening protection for consumers. Moreover, the UK is improving access to retail banking for unbanked consumers which aim to promote financial inclusion, including for those with limited experience of banking and those that may be in financial difficulty. The nine largest personal current account providers in the UK are required to offer basic bank accounts, and as of June 2018, there were 7.5 million basic bank accounts open in the UK.270 Research from the University of Birmingham shows that the number of unbanked people in the UK reached an all-time low in 2017 at 1.23 million271, down from 1.52 million in 2015-16.272 
Decent work for all (8.3, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7)
The UK is committed to working with employers and stakeholders to promote high quality work and ensure that workers have meaningful and fulfilling occupations. One focus has been working with industry and trade unions to promote good work in the economy and give workers the skills they need to succeed. 

The Apprenticeship Levy is strengthening the role of apprenticeships in the workforce, helping millions of people get onto the career ladder and develop their skills. In England, over £2.5 billion a year will be available for investment in apprenticeships by 2020. 
Activity snapshot: 
The John Lewis & Partners’ Better Jobs programme provides UK manufacturers with tools to help them incorporate positive principles (such as health & well-being, reward and respect) into their supply chains so jobs are more meaningful. To date it has 30 factories participating in the programme and will roll out to the remainder of its UK supply base during 2019.
Young people’s economic participation is crucial, and the UK’s education policy helps promote social mobility among young people to facilitate this (see Goal 4). From October to December 2018, 11.3% of 16 to 24-year-olds were not in education, employment, or training in the UK, a decrease of 0.5 percentage points from Quarter 4 of 2015 (8.6.1).273 Traineeships support social mobility by providing high-quality work placements with employers, and work preparation training, for young people who need to develop their skills and experience to enter the labour market. In England, there were 17,000 apprenticeship starts from the 63,800 traineeship starts in 2014/15, 2015/16 and 2016/17274, and the UK introduced a National Living Wage (NLW) for over-25s in 2016. It is calculated that full-time workers receiving NLW will be more than £2,750 better off a year compared to 2015.
The UK is committed to ending modern slavery in the UK, and to ensuring a response that keeps pace with the evolving threat it presents. The pioneering Modern Slavery Act 2015, gives law enforcement agencies the tools to tackle modern slavery, including maximum life sentences for perpetrators. The UK also commissioned an independent review of the Act, which concluded in spring 2019.
The UK is transforming the law enforcement response, seeing more police operations than ever before; overhauling support for victims; and working with businesses to eradicate forced labour from UK supply chains. As a result, more victims than ever before are being identified. In 2018, 6,993 potential victims were identified in the UK – a 36% increase on 2017 (see 
Goal 16).275

Climate Action (8.4, 8.9)
To achieve Goal 8 effectively, it is important to limit the impact of economic growth on the environment. 
The UK has delivered this through important progress to decouple growth from carbon emission and has reduced emissions faster than any other G7 nation contributing to climate mitigation (Goal 13).276 From 2022, a tax on the manufacture and import of plastic packaging will be introduced to encourage greater use of recycled plastic and help reduce plastic waste. Subject to consultation, this tax will apply to plastic packaging which does not contain at least 30% recycled plastic. This will improve resource efficiency by providing a clear economic incentive for businesses to use more recycled material, also contributing to sustainable production (Goal 12), and life on land  (Goal 15).
The UK continues to show international leadership to tackle climate change with its focus on energy efficiency and pursuing decarbonisation through the switch to cleaner technologies. Between 1990 and 2017, the UK reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 42%277 while growing the economy by 72%.278 This means that, for every unit of GDP output, the UK has reduced emissions by two-thirds. The UK’s support for renewable generation through mechanisms such as Contracts for Difference has helped to boost the role  of renewables in its energy mix.
Overall, energy consumption in the UK is on a longterm downward trend - between 2007 and 2016 energy consumed across the economy has decreased by 15%.279 The use of coal in the UK’s electricity mix has dropped from 40% in 2012 to just 5% in 2018 – more than an 80% decrease over just 6 years.280 In May 2019, the UK reached a week without using coal for the first time since the industrial revolution. 
In addition, sustainability is being considered as part of the proposed Tourism Sector Deal, including in terms of reducing the negative impacts of seasonality and focussing on clean growth (see Goal 12).
The UK will continue to focus on these areas to improve institutional capacity on climate change mitigation and strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards.
Scotland 
Scotland’s National Performance Framework sets out a clear purpose for opportunities for all of Scotland to flourish through increased well-being, and sustainable, inclusive economic growth. Inclusive growth has much in common with this Goal and underpins Scotland’s Economic Strategy. 
Economic performance (8.1, 8.2, 8.3)
Scotland’s Chief Economic Adviser published its triannual State of the Economy report which summarises and analyses the performance of and outlook for the economy. In 2018, Scotland’s GDP grew by 1.3% compared to 2017, and the economy continued to expand in Quarter 4 2018 growing by 0.3% over the quarter.281 Over the past year, growth was broad based across the service and construction sectors. In 2018, the manufacturing sector’s output increased by 3.2% in total.282 This included strong increases in the manufacturing of computer, electrical and optical products. This is likely to contribute towards increasing productivity through diversification, technological upgrading and innovation. 
Using recent OECD data, Scotland’s overall productivity (in terms of GDP per hour worked) ranked Scotland 16 out of 37 key OECD trading partners.283 This position has remained unchanged since 2007.
In 2018, Scotland’s Centre for Regional Inclusive 
Growth (SCRIG) was launched and the Economic Action Plan was launched to facilitate the delivery of inclusive growth across Scotland.
SCRIG will deepen the evidence base on what works in regional inclusive growth and promote best practice policy and decision-making through Regional Economic Partnerships and working with stakeholders. SCRIG hosts an interactive dashboard which contains regional economic data for Scotland to allow users to conduct an inclusive growth diagnostic for their local area.  The inclusive growth diagnostic is a six-stage framework that identifies the constraints to inclusive growth and prioritises actions to address these. The approach has been successfully piloted in local authorities in Scotland, including North Ayrshire Council who used the work to inform the development of their ‘Fair for All’ Strategy to reduce inequalities in North Ayrshire, and is being used to inform City Region and Growth Deals across Scotland.
As part of actions to make it easier for small- and medium-sized businesses to access finance so that they can use it to support jobs and achieve growth the Scottish Growth Scheme offers investment guarantees and loans to new and early-stage companies with high-growth potential, particularly those in technologyintensive sectors and emerging markets such as financial technology. 
Businesses in Scotland often find it difficult to borrow money over a longer term (10 to 15 years), known as patient finance. This will be a key focus for the Scottish National Investment Bank. The Bank will support ambitious companies and important infrastructure projects. By aligning its aims and objectives with Scotland’s Economic Strategy, the Bank has the potential to transform and grow Scotland’s economy. 
Activity snapshot: 
CivTech® brings together public sector expertise and private sector creativity to solve real problems, develop new products and deliver better, faster and easier services for everyone through co-production and focus on the citizen.
The Bank will be operational in 2020, investing in businesses and communities across Scotland. The Scottish Government has committed to investing £2 billion over 10 years to capitalise the Scottish National Investment Bank, making it a cornerstone of Scotland’s economy.
The Scotland CAN DO: Business Innovation Forum supports the improvement of Scotland’s business innovation performance by providing scrutiny and challenge of progress against the Innovation Action Plan and actions arising from the innovation chapter of the Enterprise and Skills Review and considering and providing advice on the potential impacts of emerging and longer term trends and issues on business innovation.
Fair work and employment support  
(8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8)
Scotland’s labour market is performing well for many people. Unemployment in Jan-Mar 2019 fell to 3.2%, its lowest rate on record.284 Scotland’s employment rate for 16 to 64-year-olds at 75.4% in January-March 2019 is higher than 10 years earlier (73.1%).285 Scotland has just under 1,500 living-wage accredited employers.286 However, there is more to do to ensure no one is left behind. To support this Scotland has set a target of an additional 25,000 workers to be paid the real Living Wage, or more, through employer accreditation by 2021. There are also strong links to actions under Goal 5 and Goal 10. 
Scotland is committed to becoming a Fair Work Nation by 2025 and working to remove barriers to economic inclusion through Scotland’s Fair Work Action Plan. Included in the Fair Work Action plan is the creation of a new online support tool, where small and micro employers can access support and guidance on Fair Work from a central point. In addition, there will be an expansion to the Work Place Equality Fund, enabling businesses to implement innovative ideas to embed Fair Work. Fair Start Scotland provides tailored, person-centred support to assist people in their journey towards and into work.
This work also includes targeted efforts to halve the disability employment gap as set out in A Fairer Scotland for Disabled People: employment action plan and addressing the gender pay gap. Other actions being taken within the powers of the Scottish Parliament include support for trade unions, refreshing the Scottish Business Pledge, developing the Young Workforce Programme, and ensuring that those bidding for public sector contracts do not use zero hours contracts.
To help minimise the impact for people and businesses facing redundancy, the Partnership for Action for Continuing Employment (PACE) is a national strategic partnership framework responding to redundancy situations. 
In October 2018 practical guidance was launched to help businesses identify and prevent human trafficking and exploitation across their operations. The guidance recommends that checks should be undertaken by all types of businesses to ensure workers have access to identification documents, are not being held in debt bondage and are not being coerced. The guidance also states that employees should be given training to spot signs of exploitation and encouraged to report concerns to Police Scotland or the UK-wide Modern Slavery Helpline.
Wales
Wales’s Economic Action Plan draws on levers to grow the economy, spread opportunity, reduce inequality and promote well-being. The Plan is focussed on a common purpose to work with business and others to grow the economy inclusively and spread opportunity. It includes: 
• Promoting, encouraging, and delivering responsible practices through the Economic Contract.
• Delivering public investment with a social purpose by channelling financial support to those businesses who share the same values and are investing for the future through the Government’s Calls to Action. 
The Economic Contract is the centrepiece of Wales’s Economic Action Plan and frames the reciprocal relationship between government and business to drive public investment with a social purpose. It requires businesses seeking investment to demonstrate a commitment to inclusive growth, fair work, a focus on health, skills and learning in the workplace and decarbonisation. The Plan has four distinct themes; providing an individualised approach to employment support, underlining the responsibility of employers to support staff, closing skills gaps and preparing for a radically changing labour market.

Training and employment (8.3, 8.5, 8.6)
The foundational economy, which on some estimates accounts for around 40% of jobs in Wales, describes the organisations SMEs, microbusinesses and social enterprises that are rooted in local communities and deliver the goods and services people need, from construction and childcare, through to social care and retail.
The Wales Employability Plan sets out ambitions to support people across Wales into work and to prepare the workforce for immediate and long-term challenges of the future. The support is accessible to all, including those with protected characteristics and young people at risk of disengaging from education, employment and training. 
Wales’s Apprenticeship programme raises the profile of ‘on the job’ training and is on track to create 100,000 apprenticeship employment opportunities by 2021, ensuring a focus on growth sectors to boost productivity levels in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEm) and technical sectors.

The Data Picture: Young people in education, employment or training
Coverage: Wales
Latest figures show a continued increase in the proportion of young people that are in education, employment or training to 90.5% for 16 to 18-year-olds in 2017 and for 19 to 24-year-olds this now stands at 84%, around 6 percentage points higher than in 2012.

The Flexible Skills Programme provides direct intervention where an employer’s growth is being constrained by a skills gap. From April 2018 to March 2019, the programme supported 61 employers, assisting them in achieving their workforce development needs. This is believed to have improved skills levels of 4,000 employees.
Activity snapshot: 
Coleg y Cymoedd has teamed up with Blaenau 
Gwent County Borough Council to deliver the Aspire apprenticeship programme, an initiative directly targeting towns within Blaenau Gwent - a region with the second largest unemployment levels in Wales, double the UK average to boost the take-up of apprenticeships in the area.
Fair work in Wales and community benefits  
(8.7, 8.8)
Ensuring fair work for all is a key focus of Wales’s efforts to deliver Goal 8. In Wales, the ‘Ethical Employment in Supply Chains – Code of Practice’ sets out 12 principles to drive actions on issues such as supply chain transparency, the National Living Wage and eradication of modern slavery. In its first two years 173 organisations signed up to the Code.
To address modern slavery, the Wales Anti-Slavery Leadership Group provides strategic leadership for tackling modern slavery in Wales and to provide the best possible support for survivors, adding value by coordinating collaboration across devolved and nondevolved partners and third sector organisations, to maximise opportunities for multi-agency solutions to tackle modern slavery. The Anti-Slavery Training Programme delivers a wide range of courses across 
Wales. The training is approved by Wales’s National Training Framework and in 2018 in Wales over 10,000 people were trained. Raising awareness of modern slavery is leading to an increase in the number of reported cases. The numbers of people referred onto the National Referral Mechanism (NRM) has increased year on year from 34 referrals in 2012 to 251 in 2018.287
Procurement acts as a springboard to inclusive and sustained growth. The Community Benefits policy innovatively uses public procurement to create jobs and provides training for people facing disadvantage. It encourages community engagement as a contract requirement to support community initiatives particularly in deprived communities. By April 2019, 536 public procurements had included Community Benefits requirements that have created 2,477 employment opportunities, 1,132 apprenticeships and 103,743 training weeks for Community Benefit recruits. 
Wales’s Childcare Offer provides 30 hours of early education and childcare, to working parents of three and four-year-olds for 48 weeks of the year, with parents reporting increased flexibility in the types of jobs they do, the hours they work, and their disposable income.
Northern Ireland 
Northern Ireland is committed to building a thriving, competitive economy based on having more companies with an international outlook, recording high growth, greater levels of innovation and entrepreneurship, and backed by locally-based, world-class research. This will help to provide better prospects for employment and economic growth. Key outcomes for Northern Ireland are prosperity through a strong, competitive, and regionally-balanced economy and the education of young people as contributors to society and to the economy and environment. 
Progress towards Goal 8 is being made: the employment rate has steadily increased from 67.0% in 2012, to 69.4% in 2016. This dropped slightly to 69.0% in 2017 before rising to 70.0% in 2018.288 The underemployment rate is 14.6%, having reduced from 39,000 people in 2015 working part-time who would like to work more hours to 30,000 people in 2017.271 In 2016/17, 75.5% of students leaving Northern Irish Higher Education institutions were in professional or managerial occupations290 or in further study six months after graduating.291 In addition; tourism continues to support economic growth: total spend by external visitors during overnight trips in Northern Ireland increased significantly from £463 million in 2011 to £657 million in 2017.292 Culture and art also contribute to economic growth, according to findings from latest Continuous Household Survey, 87% of adults engaged in culture and arts in 2017/18. This was a 2 percentage point increase on the engagement rate in 2016/17.293
Activity snapshot: 
Business in the Community Northern Ireland delivers an Employability Programme working with business to tackle under-employment and long-term unemployment, providing opportunities for those most in need. 
However, challenges such as innovation and promoting productive employment for all remain. In January – March 2019, the average seasonally adjusted employment rate for Northern Ireland was 71.3%,294 well below the rate of 76.1% for the UK as a whole.295 The highest employment rate (16-64) for a Local Government District (LGD) was recorded in Lisburn and Castlereagh (81.5%) and was 18.5 percentage points above the lowest rate, which was recorded in Causeway Coast and Glens (63.0%).296
Promoting innovation and growth
Innovation is a key priority to support Northern Ireland’s economic growth. The latest findings from the UK Innovation Survey show that innovation has decreased in most regions and countries. From 2014-16, Northern Ireland had the lowest share of innovation active businesses (39%), a fall from 45% in the 2012-14 period, and below the UK as a whole (49% innovation active firms).297 Concrete steps are being taken to address this gap and support delivery of Goal 8.
Through Invest Northern Ireland (Invest NI), 327 companies have been helped to engage in innovation activities for the first time. An investment of £52 million has been secured by SMEs as a result of Invest NI’s Access to Finance funds and thirteen new high potential start-ups have been supported alongside six companies through scaling activity.298 In 2018/19, 406 projects had been delivered by the further education sector through the InnovateUs programme, resulting in over 300 small businesses engaging in innovation activities to develop new products, processes or services.299
A new Entrepreneurship Ambassador has been appointed, chairing a new Entrepreneurship Forum for Northern Ireland with the aim of supporting businesses, promoting collaboration and encouraging an entrepreneurial culture in Northern Ireland. 196 companies have entered a new market to exploit trade opportunities and 97 companies have been supported in selling outside Northern Ireland for the first time.300
UK action around the world
Inclusive economic growth (8.8, 8.a, 8.b)
The UK’s international Economic Development Strategy focusses on creating jobs, catalysing investment, and harnessing the power of trade to support prosperous economies that bring people out of poverty. These efforts also impact the UK’s work to reduce poverty (Goal 1) and inequalities (Goal 10). 
CDC Group, the UK’s development finance institution, invests in countries where the private sector is weak, jobs are scarce, and the investment climate is difficult, with a focus on sectors where growth leads to jobs. In 2017, companies backed by CDC supported three-quarters of a million direct jobs; paid US$3.5 billion in taxes to their local governments and provided vital financial services to 47 million people in poor countries.  301
Economic empowerment is one of the focus areas of the UK’s Disability Inclusive Development Strategy (2018-2023), and recognises the transformative power of ensuring people with disabilities gain improved access to employment opportunities. Also, in line with the promise to Leave No One Behind, the new disability window of the UK Aid Connect Programme will create innovative solutions to the economic inclusion 
of people with disabilities in four countries.302 For example, the programme will be implemented in urban locations in Kenya and Bangladesh and will directly reach 10,000 people with a disability.
Activity snapshot: 
Through sustained bilateral engagement using the Prosperity Fund, the UK enabled the passage of the Philippines’ Ease Of Doing Business Act in 2018. As of March 2019, UK engagement has supported the removal of 5,362 rules, regulations and legislation that add unnecessary cost to business in the Philippines that add unnecessary cost to business in the Philippines. This will help address structural barriers and improve the business environment, thus encouraging inclusive and sustainable  economic growth. 
Increasing trade is key to supporting developing countries particularly least developed countries (LDCs) in achieving economic growth, in line with Goal 8. In 2017, the UK spent around £1.5 billion on Aid for Trade (AfT), this is broadly unchanged from 2015.303  
The AfT programme supports critical trade infrastructure like ports and roads, strengthens sectors so that they can be more competitive in export markets, helps reduce trade costs, and builds the skills and capacity to negotiate and implement trade agreements. 
For example, the UK is providing financial and technical support to build trade capacity in 51 of the world’s poorest countries through the World Trade Organization’s Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF). The EIF has helped LDCs increase agricultural productivity for both local consumption and for export. Approximately 60% of the EIF’s support for productive capacity-building goes to sustainable agriculture and agro-business projects, including fisheries and animal husbandry.304
Decent work for all (8.7)
Decent jobs are vital to the eradication of poverty. For many people, they are the main source of income and thus determine the type of lives they live and opportunities that they have. 
Activity snapshot: 
Sudokkho is the only skills training market development programme in in Bangladesh. The UK aid-funded programme aims to ensure increased income for marginalised and disadvantaged populations by enhancing the provision of private sector skills training in the ready-made garments and construction sectors in Bangladesh. Implemented by Palladium International, in consortium with Swiss Contact and the British Council, the programme provides technical assistance to private training institutes, in-factory training centres and relevant industry skills councils that subsequently supports women in poverty and disadvantaged populations as they pursue decent employment.
The UK’s work on decent jobs focusses on working in some of the most challenging environments to help the poorest and most marginalised to gain jobs, increase their incomes and work their way out of poverty. Between 2015/16 and 2017/18, the UK enabled 3 million people to raise their incomes or maintain/gain a better job or livelihood.305 For example, the PrOpCom Mai-karfi programme has helped over 850,000 beneficiaries increase their income by a total of over £48 million in some of the poorest parts of northern 
Nigeria.306
Modern slavery undermines efforts to achieve decent work and other Goals including gender equality (Goal 5) and peaceful, just and inclusive societies (Goal 16). 
The Global Estimates on Modern Slavery suggest that over 40 million people were victims of slavery on any given day in 2016, across all regions of the world. Women and girls accounted for 71% of modern slavery victims. One in four victims of modern slavery were children.307 Although 2016 estimates show the number of children in child labour declined by 94 million since 2000, the rate of reduction slowed by two-thirds since 2012.308
At the UN General Assembly (UNGA) 2017, the Prime 
Minister launched the Call to Action to End Forced Labour, Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking. It now has endorsements from 88 UN Member States. 
The UK’s efforts to eradicate modern slavery worldwide includes working through the multilateral system to raise political will, increase the evidence base and increase the scale of global resourcing to address the issue. These efforts are supported by a £200 million UK aid commitment to tackle the root causes of slavery – improving business and recruitment practice to eradicate exploitation in supply chains, strengthen law enforcement capacity and improve victim protection. New programmes include up to a £20 million contribution to the Global Fund to End Modern Slavery, an innovative public-private partnership which seeks to develop focussed, coherent strategies across countries and industries to reduce the prevalence of modern slavery.
Moreover, the UK’s Work in Freedom Programme focusses on preventing trafficking and forced labour of women migrant workers from South Asia. In 2018, up to £48 million was announced to tackle child labour in South Asia and conflict affected and fragile parts of Africa. This includes £10 million to protect more than 
400,000 boys and girls at risk of slavery in the Horn of Africa and along migratory routes in Somalia, Sudan and Ethiopia.
Challenges and next steps 
Promoting innovation and productivity 
Higher productivity remains the only path to sustainable growth, higher wages, and rising living standards. However, the slowdown in the UK has been more pronounced, falling from its pre-crisis average of 2.2% between 1960 and 2007, to a post-crisis average of 0.2% since 2007.309 Significant steps are being taken to improve productivity, including delivering over half a trillion pounds in capital investments since 2010. The 2018 Autumn Budget announced an increase in the National Productivity Investment Fund from £31 billion to £37 billion, supporting investments in key infrastructure, research and development (R&D), and housing supply. 

The UK wants to work with employers to give every worker the opportunity to upskill or retrain for the new economy. In England, £100 million has been pledged for the first phase of the National Retraining Scheme, announced in the last Budget, which will be rolled out this year. 
Following the Taylor Review into promoting Good Work in the UK, the UK’s Good Work Plan was published, outlining steps to increase employer transparency, protect agency workers, and strengthen the enforcement of employment rights. 
Wales faces a particular challenge in performing strongly on productivity, as research shows that, when other things are equal, productivity tends to be higher in, and near, big cities. Wales has a relatively small share of its population living in, or close to, big cities.
In 2019 Wales’s independent Fair Work Commission reviewed a range of legislative, economic and other levers to drive forward work to help make Wales a more equal, fair and just society. The Commission issued a report in May that the Welsh Government is considering as part of the commitment to creating a better working future for everyone in Wales.  The Welsh Government has established a new £3 million fund that will test new ways of nurturing and growing the everyday parts of Wales’s economy. 
Supporting the adoption of innovative new technologies will be key to delivering continued growth. The UK is already one of the best places in the world to start and grow a tech business. In 2018, the UK came 4th out of 126 countries on the Global Innovation Index (GII), which ranks global economies’ innovation readiness.310 Further strengthening this will require investment from government and industry to remain at the cutting edge. The UK’s ambition is to raise total R&D investment to 2.4% of GDP by 2027, and 3% in the longer term – placing the UK in the top quartile of OECD countries. As a first step towards this target, an additional investment of £7 billion for R&D over five years has been announced311 as part of the National Productivity Investment Fund. This is the largest increase in 40 years.
The UK is building global links to enhance opportunities from international trade. The UK’s Export Strategy aims to raise UK exports as a percentage of GDP from 30% to 35%.312 The offer to business is based on the four ways the UK can make a difference in partnership with providers of export in public and private sectors: encourage, inform, connect and finance.
Increasing economic growth for all
The UK’s Industrial Strategy aims to boost productivity by backing businesses to create good jobs and increase the earning power of people throughout the UK with investment in skills, industries, and infrastructure (See Goal 9).
In Northern Ireland, there is a longstanding economic inactivity issue and ensuring regional balance of economic prosperity in Northern Ireland currently shows considerable variation between local government geographic areas, when measuring against employment rate and economic inactivity. Addressing this is a key challenge with a suite of issues contributing to the overall rate including employability, childcare, caring responsibilities and transport infrastructure. In delivering economic growth that works for everyone, ensuring those who are furthest away from the workplace are supported is vital. In Scotland, retaining a clear focus on the Leave No One Behind agenda as the economy continues to develop with technological advances is both a challenge and opportunity. 
The UK will deliver new ways to target support for those Foreign Direct Investment projects that create the most value for investors and national wealth, focussing on maximising wealth creation for the whole of the UK. The objective is to have the greatest positive impact on the success of businesses, the creation of jobs, and the regeneration of communities, using a three-part approach: make use of data in new ways to measure economic impact of projects, identify opportunities across the UK with the greatest potential for international investment; and target government support precisely where it will make the biggest difference for the economy.

Goal 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure
Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialisation and foster innovation
Summary
The UK is committed to becoming the world’s most innovative economy, upgrading infrastructure and increasing productivity throughout the UK in order to make a real difference to people’s lives. 
Since 2015, the UK has made major commitments to improve transport and digital connectivity, including £1 billion of public investment to boost digital infrastructure.313 Support for small- and medium-sized businesses, such as increased access to finance, has been enhanced. And in the most significant support for fostering innovation in more than four decades, the UK has committed to raise spend on research and development to 2.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2027. The UK continues to support developing countries in building resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialisation, and foster innovation through a wide portfolio of programmes. 
Challenges remain, such as improving diversity in the workforce and ensuring that no area is left behind by economic growth and improved living standards. To support this, the UK government has developed an UK’s Industrial Strategy - a long-term programme for the UK economy which aims to improve quality of life for all. 
This chapter explores steps taken in the UK to support economic development and well-being through improved infrastructure, sustainable industrialisation and innovation. The UK’s Industrial Strategy is the main driver of this action, and the objectives that exist at UK level within the Strategy align with policies being driven by each nation.
Leave No One Behind examples: 
• The UK government’s Inclusive Transport Strategy sets out how the UK will deliver the necessary changes to its transport system to make it more inclusive, and to make travel easier for disabled people. This is being achieved through government interventions, working in partnership with industry and others. The Strategy outlines the UK’s ambition of equal access for disabled people using the transport system by 2030. 
• Scotland has targets in place to ensure 100% of homes and businesses in Scotland have access to superfast broadband by the end of 2021. This commitment builds on the success of the Digital Scotland Superfast Broadband programme and, in December 2017, a £600 million procurement for the Reaching 100% programme was launched with a focus on ensuring that every part of Scotland will be within reach of accessible fibre, creating new backhaul that will underpin a wide range of technologies, including 4G connectivity.
• Digital Communities Wales is delivered by the Wales Co-operative Centre and supports a partnership of organisations that are working with digitally-excluded people. The National Survey for Wales (2017-18) showed that 15% of adults do not regularly use the internet in Wales with older and disabled people, those with limited qualifications and those who were unemployed or economically inactive still the least likely to use digital technologies. The partnership offers digital training for frontline staff and volunteers loans of digital equipment and accreditation.

Action in the UK
The UK’s Industrial Strategy, shaped by over 2,000 organisations across the UK, reinforces the themes of the Goals, in particular those captured in Goal 9. It sets out to put the UK at the forefront of industries of the future, improving productivity and people’s lives, by tackling four Grand Challenges: artificial intelligence and data; meeting the needs of an ageing society; clean growth; and future of mobility.
Quality infrastructure to support economic 
development and people’s well-being  
(9.1, 9.4, 9.c) 
Supporting improved infrastructure service provision is central to the UK’s economic and human development objectives. The UK’s work in this area spans a range of sectors, including energy, transport, water and sanitation, information communications technology, housing and urban infrastructure. Improving equality and leaving no-one behind are integrated across the UK’s approach to infrastructure investment. The UK’s National Infrastructure Delivery Plan 2016-2021 identifies the need to change the make-up of the infrastructure industries through the development of skills and apprenticeships to improve diversity and a focus on investment across UK regions.
Activity snapshot: 
The UK National Infrastructure Commission (NIC) was established in October 2015 and is responsible for providing expert advice to the UK government on the pressing infrastructure challenges facing the UK. The Commission undertakes a national infrastructure assessment during each Parliament, setting out its assessment of long-term infrastructure needs with recommendations to the government and it then monitors the government’s progress in delivering the recommended projects and programmes. 
The UK’s current and future infrastructure needs are being addressed through a number of programmes aligned with the UK’s Industrial Strategy. These include: the Transport Investment Strategy, which sets out the UK’s approach to maintaining and upgrading transport infrastructure to connect communities and businesses across the UK; the Future Telecoms Infrastructure Review, which sets out the UK’s commitment to enhance digital connectivity throughout the country; and the UK government’s Inclusive Transport Strategy. 
Over 99% of the UK’s population live within 2km of an all-season road.314 UK air freight and passenger volumes have also continued to increase, with air carriers reporting 284 million passengers and 2.6 million tons of air freight in 2017, an increase of 13% and 15% respectively, from 2015.315
Over 99% of the UK population are covered by a mobile network.316 However, there remain areas where mobile connectivity must be improved, and the UK has committed to extend geographic coverage to 95% by 2022.317
A total of £200 million has been allocated through the Rural Gigabit Connectivity programme to fund full-fibre broadband connections in hard-to-reach areas across the UK, starting with all primary schools that would otherwise not be able to access to highquality broadband. This will enable the testing of new approaches to fibre roll-out in rural areas, which will benefit tens of thousands of homes and businesses across the UK, with the Borderlands, Cornwall, and Welsh Valleys among the first areas to be targeted. 
The Data Picture: Mobile coverage
Coverage: UK
Geographically, mobile coverage in the UK has improved, with at least 91% of UK landmass having 4G coverage by at least one operator in 2018 according to Ofcom’s 2018 Connected Nations report. When measured according to the percentage of premises with mobile coverage from at least one operator, 99.6% of the UK population had 2G and 3G coverage in 2016, the same level as in 2015, and 98.5% of the UK population had 4G coverage in 2016, up from 97.8% in 2015.

Between 2015 and 2018, Gross Fixed Capital 
Formation in the UK was estimated to have grown by 6% and business investment was estimated to have grown by 1%.318
The UK is committed to being the best place to start and grow a business. It is consistently rated as one of the top ten countries in the world for the ease of doing business,319 with over 1,000 businesses starting every day in the UK between 2015 and 2017.320 Through a range of funds administered by the British Business Bank, the UK has increased access to finance for small- and medium- sized businesses, currently supporting over 82,000 smaller UK businesses (see Goal 8).321
Activity snapshot: 
Be the Business, an initiative led by businesses and supported by government, has launched programmes to help small- and medium-sized businesses adopt and share best practice across the country. It will provide management training to 10,000 small business leaders in the UK by 2025 through the Small Business Leadership Programme..
Improvements to the inclusivity of industry in terms of place, pay and productivity have included a wide range of measures. To tackle the unfair spread of the UK’s prosperity, a Stronger Towns Fund, valued at £1.6 billion from 2019 to 2026, was launched in 2019 to create jobs, train local people and boost economic activity – with communities having a say on how the money is spent. 
Activity snapshot: 
The Inclusive Economy Partnership, which brings together business, civil society and government to help address major societal challenges facing those on low to middle incomes, is tackling issues such as financial inclusion and capability, transitions to work for young people and mental health awareness. Upgrading infrastructure and retrofitting industries (9.4)
Through the Sector Deals programme, a long-term partnership between government and industry, the UK is driving improvements in diversity and inclusion. The Deals have secured a commitment that women will account for 40% of all those employed in the nuclear sector by 2030, up from 22% in 2016322; the Aerospace Sector Deal saw the creation of the Women in Aviation and Aerospace Charter; and the Offshore Wind Sector Deal commits to doubling the proportion of women in the workforce to at least a third by 2029, and to establish a new target for black and minority ethnic representation in the sector by the end of 2019. 
(See Goal 10). 
Upgrading infrastructure and retrofitting industries (9.4)
Through the Future of Mobility Grand Challenge, the UK is working to create a safer and cleaner transport system that’s better able to meet the needs of all users. Cleaning up road transport is vital to improving air quality, making UK towns and cities better places to live and work.

The UK’s leading energy efficiency measures and investment in renewable technologies have contributed to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. 52.8% of electricity was generated from clean sources in 2018 – up from 23.1% in 2010 and 45.4% in 2015.323 Through the Clean Growth Grand Challenge, the UK is working to make sure that benefits of clean growth are felt by communities across the four nations, including a mission to at least halve energy use of all new buildings by 2030 (see Goal 7).
The UK is investing £170 million on innovation in construction to support the transition to low carbon, working with communities across the UK to set decarbonisation strategies and maximise the clean growth benefits in terms of new jobs and business opportunities. 
Enhancing scientific research and encouraging innovation (9.5)
In 2016 there were 4,430 researchers per million inhabitants in the UK – representing a 12.4% increase since 2011.324 Gross research and development (R&D) expenditure in the UK reached £34.8 billion in 2017. This was an increase of 4.8% on 2016 (£33.2 billion), which is higher than the long-term annual average increase since 1990 (4.1%).325 Total R&D spend in the UK in 2017 represented 1.69% of GDP, up from 
1.65% in 2015.326
Established in 2018, UK Research and Innovation, the UK’s major research funding body, brings together the seven Research Councils, the innovation agency InnovateUK and Research England to create the best possible environment for research and innovation to flourish in the UK.
To enhance the UK’s scientific research and foster innovation, an additional £7 billion in R&D investment has been committed in the period to 2021/22, as well as a commitment to raise spend to 2.4% of GDP by 2027.
Activity snapshot: 
Linked to the data revolution commitment of Leave No One Behind, the UK recently launched the world’s first Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation, ensuring the UK is leading the debate on how data-driven technologies are used to the maximum benefit of society. This will, in turn, ensure new technologies and data are used responsibly.ourish in the UK.
The Data Picture: Research and development expenditure

The UK is committed to improving access to education and training, to challenge barriers and reach those at risk of being marginalised. The Higher Education and Research Act (2017) introduced measures to support more students from all backgrounds to participate in higher education. This includes requiring universities to publish student participation and progression data broken down by gender, ethnicity and socio-economic background. 
Activity snapshot: 
‘Catapult’ centres are not-for-profit, independent centres which connect businesses with the UK’s research communities. Across digital, energy, life sciences, manufacturing, space, transport and the environment, Catapults have forged closer links between academia and industry, provided support for innovation and growth for thousands of SMEs and large companies, and built strong global relationships that are growing the UK’s industrial leadership.

Ranking and Analysis (2018)
Scotland 
Sustainable and resilient infrastructure (9.1, 9.2)
Scotland has invested significantly in its infrastructure, including schools, colleges, healthcare, transport, digital, energy, water and homes. For example, access to superfast broadband in Scotland has increased year on year, in both urban and rural areas. In 2018, over 93% of homes and businesses in Scotland had superfast broadband coverage. This is a 58% increase since 2014 (59%).327 Scotland is committed to ensuring 100% of homes and businesses in Scotland have access to superfast broadband.
The Scottish Government has set an infrastructure investment mission to steadily increase annual infrastructure investment, so it is £1.5 billion per year higher in 2025/26 than in 2019/20. 
An Infrastructure Commission for Scotland has been established to provide independent, informed advice on the nation’s vision, ambition and priorities to create a 30-year infrastructure strategy to meet the Scotland’s future economic growth and societal needs. Inclusive and sustainable industries (9.2, 9.4) 
There are close linkages to actions relevant to 
Goals 7 and 8. In 2016, Scotland launched ‘A Manufacturing Future in Scotland’ – an action plan to deliver concrete initiatives to boost productivity across the manufacturing sector. The strategy outlines government support to manufacturing SMEs to help them keep pace with technology and process developments by working in partnership with industry. 
The National Manufacturing Institute for Scotland is helping manufacturing businesses in Scotland become world leaders in innovation. 
The Construction Scotland Strategy is working to make the industry more sustainable, productive, innovative and profitable.
Zero Waste Scotland activities, including providing free food waste audits and improvement services for small businesses, are set to drive progress against the Scottish Government’s target to cut food waste by one-third  by 2025. Research (9.5) 
Scotland has a high level of research excellence combined with an extensive network of knowledge exchange and innovation activities. Much scientific research in Scotland is funded through European research initiatives, such as the Horizon 2020 programme. Targets are in place to double investment in business research and development (BERD) between 2015 and 2025. Actions in place include:
• increasing spending on business R&D grants by £15 million from 2018-2019 to 2020-2021;
• providing financial support for local solutions and small-scale research and development;
• continuing to develop a range of policies to encourage business innovation investment;
• encouraging universities and colleges to increase the effectiveness of their contribution to business innovation; and
• maximising the impact of infrastructure investment and procurement on business research and development in areas such as electric vehicles, digital and mobile technologies.

Wales 
Sustainable and resilient infrastructure (9.1, 9.2)
Infrastructure investment is one of the highest priorities for Wales. The Wales Infrastructure Plan for Growth and Jobs prioritises and coordinates the delivery of major infrastructure investments that will make a significant contribution to the long-term economic, social and environmental well-being of people and communities in Wales . 
The Welsh Government has invested £9 billion of capital funding to improve and develop infrastructure across Wales using a series of innovative financing initiatives. Investments to date have helped open areas of Wales to business and have given communities better access to public services. 
Transport is a fundamental part of this. Delivery of the South Wales Metro is underway which will transform how people travel around the region by providing faster, more frequent and joined-up services. From 2022 onwards, electrification will see bi-mode and tri-mode trains introduced on the Core Valleys Lines where they will operate entirely from overhead electric power supplemented by batteries. These electric trains will be far more efficient than the diesel trains they will replace; the electrification will be powered by 100% renewable energy, with at least 50% sourced in Wales, meaning services on the Core Valleys Lines will be entirely emission-free.
The Superfast Cymru broadband project (2012-2018) fundamentally transformed the digital landscape in Wales. Since 2013, the availability of superfast broadband across Wales has doubled. The project has provided access to over 733,000 premises across Wales that would not have been reached through market-led commercial deployment.328

Transport for Wales is a wholly-owned, notfor-profit company providing support and expertise to Wales’s transport projects, driving forward Wales’s vision of a high-quality, safe, integrated, affordable and accessible transport network. As part of a comprehensive investment package, a new and cascaded rolling stock will be introduced over the next few years and will be much more environmentally friendly than the existing fleet.
Sustainable investment (9.3)
The Development Bank of Wales was set up to support the economy of Wales by making it easier for businesses - particularly small and medium enterprises - to get the finance needed to start up, strengthen and grow. It brings together a range of public and private funds of more than £1 billion, to invest in Wales’s longterm future. 
Wales’s Mutual Investment Model was launched to promote the public interest – including well-being and value for money. Private partners are required to adopt the Code of Practice Ethical Employment in Supply Chains and establish high levels of environmental sustainability, helping deliver Wales’s well-being goals. 
Scientific research (9.5)
In 2013, Wales had 0.14% of the world’s researchers yet produced 0.3% of the world’s published articles, citations of research articles produced in Wales make up 0.49% of the global total, and 0.7% of the top 1% most highly cited papers. This evidences the efficiency of Welsh research, its impact and the world-leading nature of a significant proportion of outputs.329
In Wales, the Sêr Cymru programme supports over 160 high quality researchers with £100 million in funding. It works with leading scholars in Welsh universities, increasing the success of Welsh research and the technological, medical and environmental capabilities of the nation. Through attracting world-leading researchers to tackle some of the world’s most pressing challenges, Wales also ensures that this programme is inclusive, ensuring that a minimum of 40% of its Sêr Cymru researchers are female, and requiring all researchers to undertake unconscious bias training.
Northern Ireland 
Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure (9.1)
Economic well-being and social cohesion rely on advances in transport, water, telecommunications and housing infrastructure as key enablers to achieve the objective of connecting people and opportunities through Northern Ireland’s infrastructure. Northern Ireland’s key priorities in this area are to improve journey times on key economic corridors; increase the usage of public transport and active travel; extend superfast broadband availability; enhance the uptake of public services through electronic means; enhance provision of water and wastewater services and improve access to suitable housing. While the various elements addressed are quite distinct in terms of the services they offer and the benefits they bring, the key linkage is in terms of how they collectively help to shape the potential of the region and of individual places within the region. 
Enhancing the flow of people and goods on major inter-urban routes will be a key enabler of economic growth and a significant programme of investment. In the urban areas, Belfast Rapid Transit and new multi-modal transport hubs for Belfast and Derry/ Londonderry will incentivise the use of public transport. In the longer term, local Transport Plans integrated with the Council’s land-use Development Plans should reduce the need for motorised travel and lead to an increase in walking, cycling and public transport. 
Economic growth is also being supported through provision of superfast broadband for premises that require it and the spread of enhanced internet speed connectivity to areas which currently lag behind the government’s vision for increased coverage across the UK. Building on extended broadband availability investment, the opportunity is being taken to make more government services available online and increase the number of people who can use these online channels whilst also improving the efficiency of the public service delivery through the same approach.  The past 10 years have seen unparalleled improvements in all aspects of water and wastewater services as measured independently by Northern Ireland’s Utility Regulator and there is a programme to enhance the existing network to meet new demand and upgrade the existing infrastructure to ensure sustained service delivery and environmental performance. Work is continuing to help ensure that the supply of housing across all tenure sectors meets demand.
Encouraging innovation and enhancing research is  one of Northern Ireland’s priority growth drivers, with  a focus on building a society and an economy which  is renowned for its innovation, entrepreneurship  and creativity. 
Action is being taken to embed innovation in the culture of every business in Northern Ireland. To date, achievements include 12 Small Business Research Initiative projects which procure research and development for public sector organisations, allowing these organisations to work with highly innovative companies to solve problems; £27 million of investment in R&D activity has been secured with 58 companies engaging in R&D activities; and through Northern Ireland’s regional economic development agency, Invest Northern Ireland, 327 companies have engaged in innovation activities for the first time and £52 million investment in innovation activity has been secured.330

UK action around the world 
Facilitate sustainable and resilient infrastructure through enhanced financial, technological and technical support (9.1, 9.4, 9.a, 9.c) 
The UK, along with a coalition of partners, established the Private Infrastructure Development Group (PIDG) in 2002, to overcome obstacles to private sector involvement in infrastructure development. It has created a range of specialised financing and project development subsidiaries designed to overcome these obstacles, committing US$3.6 billion to support 183 projects in over 40 countries.331
Activity snapshot: 
The UK’s applied Research Programme on Low Volume Transport (RECAP) is the largest of its kind globally. It works in 12 African and five Asian countries and manages technical support and transport research including on themes of engineering, scientific, asset management, financing, climate change adaptation and inclusion. RECAP has spearheaded work on the improvement of Global Indicator 9.1.1 and, through working in partnership with others, this indicator has been upgraded from Tier 3 to Tier 2 by the UN.
The UK’s Development Finance Institution, CDC, has invested over £700 million in infrastructure projects in a number of developing countries over the past three years, which acts as a key complement to the UK government’s policy and programming in resilient infrastructure.332 CDC’s focus within infrastructure is on addressing the very limited supply of energy, as well as tackling the connectivity and communication gaps that limit productivity and job creation in developing countries.
Activity snapshot: 
In December 2018, CDC invested US$180 million in Liquid Telecom, the largest independent fibre and cloud provider in Africa. CDC’s investment will enable Liquid Telecom to expand broadband connectivity to some of the most underserved markets across Africa and will support the continent’s thriving tech start-up ecosystem with high-speed internet and cloudbased services.
The UK has conducted in-depth diagnostic research and planned catalytic interventions in five countries (Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, Brazil and Indonesia) to enhance the business environment and systemic capacity for digital access in excluded or underserved communities. The implementation of a programme focussed on these priorities is estimated to result in more conducive regulatory frameworks for inclusive digital access, in scalable models for affordable, safe and secure connectivity and in better digital skills and services for poor and excluded people. Models and learnings emerging from this work could be replicated to increase sustainable digital inclusion in least developed countries in the future.
Support sustainable industrialisation and domestic technology development, research and innovation in developing countries (9.2, 9.b)
The UK’s Invest Africa programme, established in 2016, aims to generate 90,000 jobs and support £1.2 billion of new manufacturing foreign direct investment by 2025, by supporting new investors and improving the operating environment for manufacturing firms in selected African countries. 
In 2018, the UK announced new Innovation Partnerships in South Africa, Kenya, and Nigeria.  These partnerships are expected to stimulate significant economic growth and support the creation of thousands of new jobs. As part of this, regional tech experts will be deployed in Kenya and Nigeria to build links between the UK and Africa’s digital sectors, support start-ups, and help those in need of digital skills to get access to training.

The UK is working with the World Road 
Association (WRA/PIARC) which holds its 
24th Congress involving over 150 countries in October 2019 in Abu Dhabi. The UK will engage and disseminate UK transport research and policy with a focus on transport inclusion and disability. This engagement will draw heavily on the UK’s High-Volume Transport Research Project, which works in Africa and Asia.
Through the Newton Fund and Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF), the UK is building research and innovation partnerships with 17 partner countries to support their economic development and social welfare, and to develop their research and innovation capacity for long-term sustainable growth. 
The GCRF provides a funding stream to support cuttingedge research on global issues affecting developing countries. The GCRF strategy specifically addresses all  17 Goals individually and collectively and requires awardees to demonstrate how their project will achieve impact against the Goals. From 2016 to 2021, the GCRF is investing £1.5 billion in harnessing the expertise of the UK’s world-leading researchers. 
Activity snapshot: 
Through the Science Granting Councils Initiative (SGCI), the UK is strengthening the capacities of 15 science-granting councils in Sub-Saharan Africa in order to support research and evidence-based policies that will contribute to economic and social development. These include policies on effective R&D investments and knowledge exchange with private sector.
Challenges and next steps
The long-term nature of the UK’s Industrial Strategy means it is integral to promoting the objectives of Goal 9 and more broadly, facilitating access to sustainable development throughout the UK. The Industrial Strategy Council (ISC), which comprises leading figures from business, academia and civil society, is providing impartial and unbiased evaluation of progress in delivering the UK’s Industrial Strategy aims. It met for the first time in the autumn of 2018 and is currently developing a series of measures to assess the implementation of the UK’s Industrial Strategy. 
In Scotland, there are concerns that EU exit will impact funding for regeneration projects, research and development and infrastructure.
Infrastructure 
A major upgrade to the UK’s infrastructure is needed. In the second half of 2019 the National Infrastructure Strategy (NIS) will be published, setting out long-term priorities for economic infrastructure, and outlining how collaboration with the private sector will expand to deliver resilience. The NIS will contribute to core UK commitments, including transport, housing and urban development. 
In Wales, delivery of digital infrastructure and broadband to remaining premises is increasingly expensive and challenging due to increased rurality and reduced clustering. However, further procurement activity has yielded an additional 26,000 premises for delivery between 2019 and 2021. 
Sustainable Industrialisation 
Since the 2008 financial crisis, the UK has faced the challenge of the ‘productivity puzzle’ where the productivity gap has widened substantially compared to competitors despite low unemployment levels. The Business Productivity Review will explore what firmlevel actions would be most effective in improving the productivity and growth of businesses. 
The UK’s EU exit provides challenges for industry to secure and regain economic and technological competence, competitiveness and industrial leadership at a national, European, and global level. However, the UK’s Industrial Strategy is focussed on tackling long-term structural issues in the UK and building an economy to be competitive over the next 20/30 years. 
The UK will continue to champion inclusive and sustainable industrialisation to ensure it is equipped for the challenges and opportunities of new technologies and ways of doing business. 
Regional growth 
There is more to be done to ensure investment is more geographically-balanced throughout the UK. Local Industrial Strategies (LIS) are being developed through collaboration with Local Enterprise Partnerships and Mayoral Combined Authorities from 2019-2020, supporting balanced regional growth. The LISs will define local priorities for how cities, towns and rural areas will maximise their contribution to UK productivity, allowing places to build on distinctive strengths, better coordinate economic policy and improve collaboration across boundaries. This will require multiple local stakeholders working together to ensure no one is left behind.

Goal 10: Reduced Inequalities
Reduce inequality within and among countries
Summary
The UK is committed to tackling the injustices in UK society and overseas so that no one is left behind. Everyone should be able to go as far as their hard work and talent can take them, which means removing the barriers and inequalities that exist. 
The UK has some of the strongest legislation on equality issues in the world, including the Equality Act 2010, which provides a legal framework to advance equality of opportunity for all. It is working to help disadvantaged groups to achieve their potential, for example through the UK government’s LGBT Action Plan333 which was based on the largest national survey on LGBT issues of its kind globally.334 Tackling extreme poverty and helping the world’s most vulnerable is one of the pillars of the UK Aid Strategy.
This chapter explores the UK’s approach to ensuring inclusion and equality of opportunity for all, and progress made in addressing inequalities and injustices both in the UK and internationally. Achieving this is closely associated with activities under many other Goals, including those on poverty (1), education (4), gender equality (5), economic growth and decent work (8), and peaceful and inclusive societies (16).
Leave No One Behind examples:
• The UK has carried out the world’s largest Race Disparity Audit that launched Ethnicity Facts and Figures, a website of unprecedented scope highlighting ethnic disparities across services and outcomes. The UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) has carried out an Equalities Data Audit that considered data quality and areas for improvement.
• In December 2018 a new Regional Stakeholder Network was announced to bring the views of disabled people and local disabled organisations across England closer to government. It will create forums in 9 regions to share experiences about policies and services that affect them. 
• Scotland’s Tackling Prejudice and Building Connected Communities Action Plan, published in June 2017, is an ambitious programme of work to tackle hate crime and build community cohesion. 
• In Wales, the £3.9 million Equality and Inclusion funding programme, provides strategic support for local, regional and national organisations working in the areas of gender, disability, Gypsies, Roma and Travellers, refugees and asylum seekers, sexual orientation and gender identity, race and hate crime.
• In Northern Ireland there are number of community relations programmes delivered annually, aiming to improve both intra- and inter-community relations, to create new shared and inclusive spaces, to promote diversity, inclusion, tolerance, peace, reconciliation and appreciation of different cultures and traditions. These are delivered under the ‘Together: Building a United Community Strategy’ and the ‘Good Relations Strategy’.

Action in the UK
Supporting income growth of the poorest (10.1)
As part of its ambition to deliver higher living standards, the UK has introduced the National Living Wage for all workers over 25.335 Over 60% of those benefiting from it are women.336 In the Good Work Plan of 2018, the UK commits to ensuring that workers can access fair, decent work and to strengthening employment rights.337
The UK has a goal to see 1 million more disabled people in work by 2027, through initiatives such as the Access to Work scheme, which provides disabled employees with financial support for workplace adjustments and assistive technology.338 There has been progress, with over 700,000 more people with disabilities in work in 2019 than in 2015.339 The increase has also been affected by a number of external factors, such as the current strength of the overall labour market and rising disability prevalence. 
The Work and Health Programme is using the expertise of private, public, voluntary and community sector providers to deliver sustained employment for disabled people, disadvantaged groups and the long-term unemployed. See Goal 4 for more on training for access to work.
Access to university has widened, particularly for ethnic minorities and those from disadvantaged backgrounds.340

The National Community Lottery Fund 
is a distributor of National Lottery funding, supporting communities across England, Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland. Money raised through the Lottery funds projects and activities that transform communities, protect heritage, and enrich lives through arts, sports and culture. The National Community Lottery Fund also distributes money from dormant bank accounts across the UK to tackle social injustices. One example is the £90 million allocation of funding in England to the Youth Futures Foundation (YFF). The YFF is an independent organisation which has been established to remove barriers for those furthest from the labour market, and to help address the ethnic disparities in youth unemployment.
The Data Picture: Income growth rates for the bottom 40% and all households
Coverage: UK
Since the 5-year period ending 2011/12, the average growth rate for the bottom 40% of households has been higher than the national average (Global Indicator 10.1.1). During the 5-year period ending 2017/18, annualised average income growth was 3.8% for the bottom 40% and 2.4% for all households. Therefore, the UK is currently meeting Global Target 10.1.
Complementary measures show income inequality to be falling slightly. Income inequality in disposable income, measured by the Gini coefficient, for which lower values represent more equally distributed household income, has increased slightly in the last two years. Despite this small rise, it remains lower than the peak of 34.1 reached in 2006/07 prior to the economic downturn. The Palma ratio, which shows income of the bottom 40% relative to the top 10%, has also fallen slightly over this period. Despite this, the UK has the sixth highest level of income inequality in the OECD.

The Data Picture: Employment opportunities for people with disabilities
Coverage: UK
In the first quarter of 2019, the employment rate for disabled people (51.7%) remained well below that of non-disabled people (81.7%). There were over 1 million more people with disabilities in work in 2018 than in 2013, when the time series began, and over 700,000 more than in 2015. The employment rate for disabled people also rose from 43.6% to 51.7% over the same period. The increase was greater for disabled women than men (9.4 and 6.6 percentage points respectively).

Activity snapshot: 
To help in tackling inequalities within the UK’s labour market, the disability organisation Leonard Cheshire established its Change 100 programme. This programme is a talent and professional development programme that connects disabled students and graduates with some of the UK’s best-known employers, through paid summer internships. It launched the programme in 2013 with an ambition to change the employment landscape for disabled students and recent graduates and challenge misconceptions of disability. So far, it has supported over 400 young disabled people and over 130 employers.
Promoting the social, economic and political inclusion of all and reducing inequalities (10.2, 
10.3, 10.4)
The UK is strengthening its policy and institutional framework on equality: the move of the Government Equalities Office to the UK government Cabinet Office supports a more coordinated approach. The Equality and Human Rights Commission is an independent national equality body and UN-recognised National Human Rights Institute. 
The UK is recognised as one of the most progressive countries in Europe for LGBT rights by ILGA-Europe.341 The comprehensive LGBT Action Plan sets out 75 commitments that the UK government will take in response to the 2018 LGBT survey findings. While over half of respondents (56%) felt comfortable being LGBT in the UK, on average they were less satisfied with their life nowadays than the general population.342
Following the introduction of same sex marriage in England, Wales and Scotland, the UK is taking steps to address asymmetry in access to marriage and civil partnership. The Scottish Government has consulted on how to address this inequality in Scotland. After recently consulting the public about the Gender Recognition Act, the UK is considering how to make legal gender recognition less bureaucratic and intrusive for transgender people. 
The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities guiding principles are integral to the UK’s approach to strengthening rights under the Equality Acts. The UK government published a revised National Planning Policy Framework in 2018 for England that expects local authorities to have planning policies which identify the type of homes needed for disabled people as well as other groups, using the UK government’s optional technical standards for accessible and adaptable housing (Goal 9 discusses access to transport and the UK government’s 2018 Inclusive Transport Strategy).343
The 2017 General Election saw the most diverse UK Parliament ever: the proportion of female MPs increased from 29% to 32%, LGBT MPs from 6% to 7%, and ethnic minority MPs from 6% to 8%.344 The UK is working with disability organisations to help political parties better support disabled candidates; in December 2018, a £250,000 interim fund, EnAble, was launched to support disabled candidates in local elections in England. 
The Lammy Review of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) representation in the Criminal Justice System in 2017 highlighted disparities in outcomes.345 The UK has responded to all 35 recommendations, as reflected in its 2018 update publication. For example, the UK has set targets for diversity in Her Majesty’s Prison and Probation Service’s workforce, is listening to the views of offenders and black and minority ethnic (BAME) groups and improving ethnicity data collection to design policy accordingly. 
The UK led a consultation on how mandatory ethnicity pay-reporting could improve fairness in the workplace. 
Activity snapshot: 
Businesses in the UK have taken tangible steps towards increasing the diversity and inclusivity of their workplaces. For instance, by signing the Social Mobility Pledge, a cross-party campaign to improve social mobility in the UK, companies including ITV, John Lewis, M&S and hundreds more have committed to providing apprenticeships and adopting fair recruitment practices. 
Business in the Community’s Race at Work Charter is composed of five principal calls to action for leaders and organisations across all sectors. Signing up means taking practical steps to ensure their workplaces are tackling barriers that ethnic minority people face in recruitment and progression and that their organisations are representative of British society today. 
The Big Exchange is an initiative launched by The Big Issue and a number of founding partners and individuals. It aims to build a more inclusive financial system with the intention that it delivers a positive social and environmental impact. The Big Exchange will give people a new approach to saving and investing tied together by a digital social passport where positive impact is rewarded. High Speed Two is the new railway that will be the backbone of Britain’s transport network. The company building it, HS2 Ltd, believes that everyone, whatever their mobility, should be able to board their trains with ease. HS2 Ltd is working to ensure that HS2 trains can be accessed independently and remains confident it will set a new standard for inclusive rail travel.
In the refresh of the Hate Crime Action Plan, the UK has committed additional funding to continue to protect places of worship from hate attacks, alongside just over £12.5 million for projects to tackle racially and religiously motivated hatred (see Goal 16). 
Activity snapshot: 
The Rainbow Flag Award is a national quality assurance framework for all schools and colleges, focussing on LGBT inclusion and visibility. The Rainbow Flag Award is delivered by The Proud 
Trust, in partnership with The Kite Trust, Allsorts Youth Project and Humankind. It encourages a whole organisation approach to LGBT inclusion, as well as developing strategies to combat homophobic, biphobic and transphobic bullying.
The Arts Council England promotes diversity in the arts and cultural sector. For example, the Sustained Theatre Fund Supports the development of established and emerging black and minority ethnic (BAME) theatre makers. The Unlimited III project is levering new opportunities for deaf and disabled artists.
The Equality and Human Rights Commission works directly with organisations to achieve compliance with the 2010 Equality Act, for example its work with the Premier League helped secure an additional 700 spaces for wheelchair users at football grounds.
Scotland
Scotland’s National Performance Framework sets a common purpose for Scotland which has reducing inequalities at its heart. Tackling inequality is key to making Scotland a more successful nation and making progress across the Goals. Fairer Scotland (10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4)
In 2016 Scotland held a nationwide conversation with over 7,000 people taking part in events and locally organised discussions, and nearly 17,500 people engaging online.346 This led to the Fairer Scotland Action Plan which contains commitments from a range of organisations to help build a more successful Scotland: one with low levels of poverty and inequality, genuine equality of opportunity, stronger life chances and support for all those who need it. The Plan is built on five high level ambitions to 2030: 
• A fairer Scotland for all.
• Ending child poverty.
• Strong start for young people.
• Fairer working lives.
• Thriving third age.
Scotland has a mature framework of legislation and policies to tackle inequality, including a Race Equality Framework for Scotland 2016 to 2030. It is recognised as a progressive nation on LGBT rights and same-sex couples have been able to marry in Scotland since 16 December 2014. However, a 2017 study by LGBT Youth Scotland 347 of more than 600 LGBT young people showed that, for example, 63% of LGBT young people surveyed who had experienced bullying believed that it had negatively impacted on their education.348
It is paramount that efforts to tackle all forms of prejudice, including any linked to gender identity are continued. For example, Scotland is on its way to becoming the first nation in the world to have lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) inclusive education embedded in the curriculum. As part of work to improve the well-being and protect the human rights of Gypsy Traveller families, Scotland published the Improving educational outcomes for children and young people from travelling cultures: guidance. This assists schools, local authorities and other stakeholders to support engagement in education and adapt to diverse learner needs.
Families with a disabled person are more likely to be in poverty 349 and a range of actions are in place to tackle this inequality including A Fairer Scotland for Disabled People: Our Delivery Plan to 2021, which was developed in partnership, and No One Left Behind: Next steps for employability support. Local and national government, employers and the third sector are working in partnership to halve the disability employment gap from its 2016 level, which would mean an estimated extra 130,000 disabled people in work in Scotland. 
The Data Picture: Hate crimes
Coverage: Scotland 
Global Target 10.3 highlights the need to ensure equal opportunity and reduce inequalities of outcome, including by eliminating discriminatory laws, policies and practices and promoting appropriate legislation, policies and action in this regard. Racial crime remains the most commonly reported hate crime. There were 3,249 charges reported in Scotland in 2017/18, with a decreasing trend in recent years.

In Scotland the Access to Elected Office Fund provides financial support to pay for the additional impairmentrelated costs that disabled people face when running for elected office. This helps level the playing field with non-disabled candidates. It supported 39 disabled candidates in standing for election to local councils in 2017. 15 candidates were elected across Scotland, representing a range of disabilities, political parties and were gender-balanced. 
Tackling prejudice, public service reform and local outcomes (10.3)
In 2017, the Tackling Prejudice and Connected Communities Action Plan was launched to tackle hate crime and build community cohesion. Actions include work on under-reporting, third party reporting, data and public campaigns.
Scotland’s approach to public service reform is built on a recognition that inequalities tend to affect people, household and communities in complex and interconnected ways and therefore, a ‘whole system’ approach is utilised built on an understanding of people and communities. In law (Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act 2015) community planning is focussed on improving outcomes and tackling inequalities of income on locally identified priorities, including in places where communities experience the poorest outcomes. Both local and national government in Scotland have adopted a ‘place-based approach’.
Facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people (10.7)
Since 2015, Scotland has welcomed over 2,700 refugees from the Syrian conflict across all 32 local authorities as part of the Syria Vulnerable Persons 
Resettlement Scheme.350

Two projects coordinated by Carnegie UK Trust, the Kindness Innovation Network and Kindness in North Ayrshire, parallel networks of professionals and people, which are developing ideas and delivering small tests of change to encourage kindness in local and national government, in organisations and public services, and in communities.
Wales
A fairer Wales (10.1)
The latest figures show that average disposable income per head in Wales is £15,835,351 around 80% of the overall UK value. Wales is committed to eliminating the gap in working age unemployment, and economic inactivity rates between Wales and the UK average within 10 years. The Employability Plan sets out the steps that Wales will take to help people into the right jobs and equip them with the right skills to progress. It builds on the community employability programmes, which will provide intensive mentoring and support to both engage participants and address the complex barriers to employment experienced by those furthest from the labour market. 
Wales strongly supports measures that increase household income and continues to promote the adoption of the Foundation Living Wage across the public, private and voluntary sectors. The Welsh Government has been accredited as a Living Wage employer since 2015 and the National Health Service in Wales has paid the living wage since January 2015. Local authority pay scales start from above the Foundation Living Wage level. 
The employment rate among disabled people aged 16-64 was 45.2% in 2018, which is lower than among people who are not disabled (80.3%). This means there was a disability employment gap of 35.1 percentage points. This gap has remained stable in recent years.352 Across all disabled people the disability pay gap in Wales in 2010-11 was 4.3%, whilst by 2015-16 this figure had risen to 13.3%.353 The new Right to Independent Living Plan will be published in 2019.
Empowering and promoting the social, economic and political inclusion of all and reducing inequalities of outcome and discriminatory laws, policies and practices (10.2, 10.3, 10.4)
The Welsh Government has brought in specific equality duties in order for public bodies to better perform and demonstrate their compliance with the UK Public Sector Equality Duty. The regulations place duties on the devolved public sector, including the Welsh Government, covering equality impact assessments, publishing and reviewing Equality Objectives and Strategic Equality Plans, engagement, pay differences, procurement, reporting arrangements and equality and employment information. In March 2016, the Welsh Government published refreshed Strategic Equality Objectives setting out its commitment to promote equality and inclusion. It is currently reviewing these and taking into account the findings of the Is Wales Fairer? 2018 report, published by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, which describes how levels of inequality in Wales are increasing, and the need for more work in communities and all areas of life. 
The Diversity in Democracy Programme supports people from diverse backgrounds to become more involved in local democracy and consider standing for elected office. 
The number of hate crimes reported in Wales has nearly doubled since 2012/13, to 3,370 in 2017/18.  To support community cohesion, eight Regional Community Cohesion Teams work across all 22 local authorities to fulfil the objectives of the community cohesion programme.
To introduce participants to Welsh language culture and life as well as to support community cohesion, the National Centre for Learning Welsh offers free Welsh lessons to refugees in partnership with the Welsh Refugee Council in Cardiff and in partnership with the Red Cross in Newport. There are also opportunities to learn the language informally at social gatherings.
Activity snapshot: 
The All Wales black and minority ethnic (BAME) Engagement Programme is a BAME engagement project, funded by the Welsh Government, working with partners and other stakeholders, and led by the Ethnic Minorities & Youth Support Team Wales.
Facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people (10.7)
Responsibility for asylum and immigration rests with the UK government rather than the Welsh Government. However, the successful integration of refugees and asylum seekers will require concerted effort on the part of the Welsh Government, Welsh public services and Welsh communities. Wales has an ambition to be a Nation of Sanctuary, and the Nation of Sanctuary – Refugee and Asylum Seeker Plan captures a range of actions to improve the lives of people seeking sanctuary in Wales, that can help reduce inequalities, increase access to opportunities and enable better relations between communities. There are commitments to ensure that refugees and asylum seekers can access health services throughout their asylum journey; are provided with information and advice to allow them to integrate into Welsh society from day one; are prevented from becoming destitute; and can access educational opportunities. The plan has been endorsed by the United Nation’s High Commissioner for Refugees.
Encouraging financial flows to states where the need is greatest (10.a, 10.b, 10.c)
The Welsh Government-funded Hub Cymru Africa and the Wales for Africa grants scheme that provides advice, training, support and small grants to the hundreds of groups in Wales working in partnership towards the Goals in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Northern Ireland
To promote a positive impact on the lives of minority ethnic people, work is ongoing to review the Minority Ethnic Development Fund, to introduce ethnic impact assessment and to address Gypsy, Roma, Traveller community issues. Work to revise and improve Northern Ireland’s racial equality legislation is also underway.
The Make the Call Wraparound Service aims to reach 
55,000 people to ensure that they are receiving all the benefits and support to which they are entitled. The scope of the Service is continuously evolving to help those in poverty, older people, and those experiencing illness or disability.
Disability employment support programmes up to the end of August 2018 have helped 2,259 people retain their employment.354 Monitoring is continuing of the life satisfaction score of people with disabilities alongside that of the wider population. Recent figures demonstrate that the average life satisfaction of people with a disability remains stable. Northern Ireland is committed to ensuring that a percentage of new social home starts are wheelchair accessible and 4% (61) of all new social home starts from January to March 2018 were wheelchair accessible. 
The Department for Communities facilitates a crossdepartmental funding arrangement that supports Special Olympics Ulster in the provision of fundamental movement, physical activity and sports opportunities for people of all ages with learning restrictions. 
Activity snapshot: 
The introduction of disability sports hubs in each Northern Ireland local council area with the associated specialist activity equipment has required successful collaboration between central and local government together with several partners such as Public Health Agency, Royal National Institute of Blind People and the 
Blind Golf Association, Special Olympics, Ulster Northern Ireland Deaf Sports and the key disability representative groups, such as Disability Action and Mencap. 
Belfast Healthy Cities delivers the Child Friendly Spaces programme that seeks to put Child Friendly Places higher on the public sector agenda in Belfast and Northern Ireland by using feedback from children engagement events to influence options for planning policy and other place-shaping strategies, for example by developing guidelines for policymakers.
It also delivers the Healthy Ageing programme that aims to highlight the needs of older people in policy making processes by promoting the use of the Age Friendly Environments in Europe tool (AFEE) for establishing age-friendly programmes at local government level, particularly within the community planning process. A Health Equity programme under the same Belfast Healthy Cities initiative seeks to reduce health inequalities within Belfast and Northern Ireland by delivering Reducing Inequalities training to statutory and third sector stakeholders; by promoting the use of Health Equity Tool within relevant organisations; and by supporting the development of a Care Zone approach to tackling poor mental health levels in deprived communities through the support of a pilot project in north Belfast.
UK action around the world 
Promoting the social economic and political inclusion of all and eliminating discrimination (10.2, 10.3)
The UK works to reduce inequality globally by ensuring that people have access to opportunities and services, prioritising the most vulnerable, those caught in crises, and those most at risk of violence and discrimination. Between 2015 and 2018, it reached 26.8 million people with humanitarian assistance.355 Its policies and programmes are informed by country diagnostics that consider issues of inclusion.
Social protection investments have benefited the lives of millions of people (over 8.9 million between 2011 and 2015),356 reducing vulnerability and empowering the disadvantaged. The UK has launched a £12 million programme to promote and defend Freedom of Religion or Belief. In July 2018, the Prime Minister appointed Lord Ahmad as the Special Envoy on this issue, which has enabled better focussing of efforts. 
To improve the international picture for LGBT rights, the UK Aid Connect funding mechanism includes a thematic programme over four years to advance LGBT inclusion. A programme to support LGBT and gender equality in the Commonwealth is working to repeal discriminatory laws and advance legal equality.
An estimated one billion people, 15% of the world’s population, are living with some form of disability.357 The UK hosted the first-ever Global Disability Summit raised global attention on a long-neglected issue, mobilised new global and national commitments on disability and showcased good practice, innovation and evidence from around the world. Over 320 organisations signed the Charter for Change, openly committing to working together and stepping up ambition for disability inclusion. The UK has also successfully led international discussions to include a disability marker in the Official Development Assistance (ODA) statistics through the OECD Development Assistance Committee and will use this to monitor progress. The UK government’s Department for International Development’s (DFID) Disability Inclusion Strategy (2018 – 2023) sets out how it will put disability at the heart of everything it does.358
Activity snapshot:
The Global Disability Innovation Hub harnesses academic excellence, innovative practice and cocreation to tackle global challenges from a new perspective. The hub provides a platform for the talents of disabled people and the expertise of practitioners, academics and local communities. Over the next ten years the Global Disability Innovation Hub wants to become the leading place to research, study, practice and share disability innovation, globally.
Improving regulation and monitoring of global financial markets and institutions and ensuring representation of developing countries (10.5, 10.6)
The UK is an active participant in the Financial Stability Board (FSB), a key international grouping of finance and central bank officials, and leads by example on the implementation of the G20 and FSB’s post-crisis financial regulatory reforms. The UK also supported the work of the G20 ‘Eminent Persons Group’s recommendations on how to reform the global financial system to ensure sustainable, inclusive growth and improve financial surveillance. 
The UK is committed to ensuring the representativeness of international financial institutions. As part of the capital increases for the World Bank Group agreed in 2018, the UK supported measures to rebalance shareholding and increase the representation of emerging and developing economies. The UK also supported reforms implemented in 2016 at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to protect the quota shares and voting power of the IMF’s poorest member countries, resulting in four emerging market economies being among the IMF’s 10 largest members. 
The UK supported China and India joining the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development. It also actively supported the creation and growth of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, whose membership includes many developing countries.
Facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people (10.7)
The UK supports the UN Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, both as a step forward in international co-operation to tackle irregular migration and as a framework to help the international community deliver its commitments under the Goals. A new £75 million migration programme, Safety Support and Solutions Phase II is aimed at making migration safer and providing critical humanitarian support.
The UK is strongly committed to supporting refugees, the refugee convention and to enabling a longer term, more holistic approach to refugee assistance and protection. It is resettling 20,000 refugees into the UK through the Syria Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme and up to 3,000 of the most vulnerable children and their family members from the Middle East and North Africa region by 2020.359 A ‘community sponsorship’ scheme enables local community groups to welcome and support the integration of refugees in the UK. The Integrated Communities Action Plan published in February 2018 set out a commitment to build a fairer society,  and includes a focus on the effective integration of migrants in the UK (see Goal 11).360

Special and differential treatment for developing countries, in particular Least Developed Countries (10.a)
The UK remains committed to ensuring developing countries can reduce poverty through trading opportunities. The Taxation (Cross-Border Trade) Act enables the UK to put in place a UK trade preferences scheme for developing countries. The Act also enshrines into UK law the commitment contained in the Goals to provide duty-free, quota-free trade access for Least Developed Countries. 
Encouraging ODA and financial flows to states with greatest need (10.b, 10.c)
The UK committed in law in 2015 to spend 0.7% of national income on aid or Official Development Assistance (ODA) and has met this every year, spending £14.1 billion on ODA in 2017.361 It is focussing UK aid where the need is greatest, expanding work in the Sahel and Africa and meeting the ODA target of spending 0.15-0.2% of Gross National Income in the Least Developed Countries. 
Over 50% of UK aid goes to the most fragile and conflict-affected states.362 As the UK’s development finance institution, the CDC invests capital in the poorest and most fragile countries; it has committed over £700 million in infrastructure projects in Africa and South Asia over the past three years (2015-17).363 The Private Infrastructure Development Group (PIDG) set up by the UK and other donors delivers pioneering infrastructure: in 2017 PIDG committed US$487 million to infrastructure projects, facilitating US$2.5 billion of additional investment in some of the lowest-income countries (see Goal 9).364
In 2017 alone, US$9.7 billion in remittances was sent from the UK.365 The UK is working to reduce the cost of remittances, for example by strengthening the regulatory environment, encouraging innovative financial technology (FinTech) solutions and improving transparency around costs and market competitors. It is enhancing competition, transparency and efficiency of remittances markets in several developing countries. 
The Data Picture: Remittance costs 
Coverage: Global and UK  
Since the Goals were agreed, the total average cost of sending remittances from the UK, as a proportion of the amount remitted, reduced moderately from 7.49% at the start of 2015 to 6.97% at the start of 2019 (10.C.1). Between Q3 and Q4 2018 the UK saw the third largest decrease in total average cost when compared with other G8 countries. The Goals aim to reduce the global average to 3% by 2030.

Challenges and next steps 
Tackling prejudices in communities
Tackling deep-seated prejudices within communities requires cultural change. The UK will work to address harmful gender stereotypes and gender norms, engaging with the media and schools. As part of the LGBT Action Plan, there will be more work with schools to prevent bullying and improve the police response to hate crime. The UK will strive to improve the representation of disadvantaged groups in public life and champion role models. It will champion LGBT rights in all international fora including delivering an international conference focussing on the issues LGBT people face around the world, and continue to engage closely with employers to build inclusion in the workplace. 
Activity snapshot: 
Stonewall has helped to improve the lives of LGBT people by improving social attitudes towards LGBT people. It works with over 760 UK employers and 131 global businesses to empower them to create LGBT-inclusive workplaces. It is working with the UK government and other stakeholders to support implementation of the Hate Crime Action Plan.
Disability is growing in prevalence. 22% of the population in the UK is now disabled and this is set to grow as the population ages.366 In 2018, a UK government Inter-Ministerial Group on Disability and Society was established to drive forward action across government to tackle the barriers disabled people face to full inclusion. Opportunities that are enabling more disabled people to live increasingly independent lives will be seized, such as technology advances. Addressing intersectionality between inequalities
Given the intersections between inequalities, the UK’s ambition is to take an ever more co-ordinated approach to its work on equality. With the Government Equalities Office moving to the heart of the UK government in the Cabinet Office in April 2019, the government will do more to connect its action on LGBT and gender equality with its work reducing disparities for other disadvantaged groups such as ethnic minorities and people with disabilities. It will also do more to listen to disabled people and their representatives through the new Regional Stakeholder Forum, while also creating an engagement programme that will provide a listening platform for women with multiple barriers to influence policy. In Scotland, the range of policies and frameworks in place require effective implementation to meet this Goal; working in partnership is essential to achieving this. Further actions have emerged as part of the Race Equality Action Plan and Highlight Report, including addressing the barriers experienced by Gypsy Travellers.
Supporting inclusive economic growth to end poverty and reduce inequality
Globally, the way to end poverty and inequality is through inclusive economic growth, jobs, investment and trade. Looking ahead, the UK will drive delivery of its Economic Development Strategy, published in 2017, stimulating growth that creates productive jobs and spreads the benefits right across society. As a global leader in catalysing private finance to support the development agenda and tackle inequality among countries, the UK will mobilise greater volumes of international and domestic private capital at scale to deliver the Goals.
Through efforts by government, the private and civil society, the UK will work to build a more just world where no one is left behind. It will invest in access to services and opportunities for the most vulnerable. And it will support disaggregated data and increased research and evidence about the causes and consequences of extreme poverty, exclusion, violence and discrimination.

Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities
Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable
Summary 
Across the UK, local communities are working hard to make the places they call home happy, safe and prosperous. 
The UK is determined to help make this happen. More homes are being built, more public transport is being made accessible for all and communities are being given the tools they need to improve their local areas and safeguard their heritage. Attention has turned to improving air quality in cities and developing the green spaces that enhance environments. However, further work is needed to ensure that the housing system works for everyone, including addressing homelessness and rough sleeping to ensure nobody is left behind, whether in urban or rural areas. 
Internationally, the UK is sharing its expertise to help others build the sustainable cities and infrastructure of the future. This will be key as the world continues to face the challenge of natural disasters, changing climates, and shifting populations. 
This chapter covers the broad set of factors that determine the well-being of the UK’s homes and communities. Some of these, such as housing, are devolved, while others like air quality are handled at both a national and UK level. Health (3), industry and infrastructure (9) and the environment (13,14,15) are discussed in more detail in other chapters. 
Leave No One Behind examples:
• In England, the £1.6 billion Stronger Towns Fund, launched in March 2019, will create new jobs, train local people and boost economic activity in England, with communities having a say on how the money is spent. 
• Since 2013, over 210,000 households in England have purchased a home through the ‘Help to Buy scheme’, and over 2016-2022, 250,000 affordable homes will be delivered in England funded by £9 billion of investment.
• Between 2016 and 2021, 50,000 affordable homes will be delivered for people in Scotland, including 35,000 for social rent, backed by investment of over £3.3 billion over this target period.
• In July 2016, Wales set up the Ministerial Taskforce for the South Wales Valleys to bring economic development to the area to ensure it is not left behind. 
• Belfast Healthy Cities supports a place-based approach to sustainable community development through the use of the Place Standard Tool which helps gather local people’s views of the quality of their living environment and how policies may impact this.

Action in the UK
Access to safe and sustainable transport systems (11.2) 
The UK is committed to providing safe, affordable, and sustainable transport systems which share the benefits of innovation with all of society. The UK government’s 2018 Inclusive Transport Strategy outlines a programme for creating a transport system offering equal access for disabled people by 2030. A framework for monitoring the progress of this strategy has been published.367
The ‘Future of Mobility’ is one of four Grand Challenges in the UK’s Industrial Strategy (see Goal 9). The 2019 Future of Mobility: Urban Strategy argues that mobility innovation should benefit all parts of the UK and all segments of society. Future Mobility Zones, with £90 million of funding, will trial a range of mobility services focussed on significantly improving mobility for consumers.
The Data Picture: Accessible Transport - Buses 
Coverage: Great Britain
In March 2018, 98% of buses in Britain had been issued with an accessibility certificate (up from 89% in March 2015). An additional 1% were deemed suitable for wheelchair access through low-floor designs. 
Proportion of buses with an accessibility certificate: 2013/14 to 2017/18

The Data Picture: Accessible Transport Rail Stations
Coverage: Great Britain
Across Britain, 61% of stations provide stepfree access. The provision of access for people with reduced mobility can vary considerably, depending on what type of access is considered. For example, whilst only 44% of stations within London are step-free, 87% of stations do provide accessible ticket machines.

Improving resilience to disaster (11.5, 11.b)
The National Risk Register outlines key risks with the potential to cause significant disruption to the UK, and sets out actions people and businesses can take to protect themselves.
In 2016, the rate of deaths from exposure to natural forces in England and Wales stood at 0.82 per million population, up from 0.62 per million population in 2015.368 Climate change is not only a future challenge; experts are already observing changes in the UK’s climate and communities must be prepared to deal with the impacts. 
The Office of National Statistics (ONS), working with a number of partners, is developing innovative data approaches to measure domestic targets set out in the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and creating new estimates of disaster mortality which align with hazards listed in the National Risk Register.
Air quality in cities (11.6)
Creating healthy, environmentally-friendly cities is a priority across the UK. Air quality has improved since 2010: by 2017 emissions of sulphur dioxide had fallen by 62%, nitrogen oxide by 29%, and PM2.5 (fine particulate matter) by 10%.369 The measures set out in the UK-wide Clean Air Strategy should cut the cost of air pollution by £1.7 billion every year by 2020, rising to £5.3 billion every year from 2030. The UK will set an ambitious, long-term target to reduce people’s exposure to a range of damaging pollutants, including particulate matter (PM) which the World Health Organization has identified as the most damaging pollutant. 
In 2017, a UK-wide plan was launched to tackle roadside nitrogen dioxide concentrations, backed by £3.5 billion of investment.
Access to safe and accessible public spaces (11.7)
In 2017, 5% of UK urban areas were classed as “publicly assessible green spaces”.370 Green spaces offer a common place to come together, overcome social isolation and break down barriers.
England 
Access to safe and affordable housing for all (11.1)
The 2017 Housing White Paper outlined ambitious plans to reform the housing market and boost the supply of homes in England. This includes measures to plan for the right homes in the right places, to build homes faster and diversify the housing market. Reforms to the National Planning Policy Framework have ensured that England’s planning system supports housing supply objectives, and greater freedoms have been provided to allow local authorities to borrow for new homes.
In 2017-18, 222,190 additional homes (195,290 of which were new builds) were created in England, an increase of 17% since 2015/16.371 This brings the total number of additional homes created since April 2015 to over 629,000, on track to meet targets to deliver a million homes by the end of 2020 and a half a million more by the end of 2022. A range of measures are being implemented and developed so that, by the middle of the 2020s, an unparalleled 300,000 new homes a year will be built in England.372
The Data Picture: Net Additional 
Dwellings
Coverage: England
Net additional dwellings are the headline measure of new housing supply and comprise new build, conversions, change of use, other gains/losses and demolitions. The number of net additions has increased year on year since 2014-15 and there were over 222,000 additional homes in 201718 – the highest level in all but one of the last 31 years.

Following the Grenfell Tower fire, work has been undertaken to remedy buildings with unsafe cladding and an Independent Review of Building Regulations and Fire Safety has been established. The Review’s findings are being taken forward to ensure residents of high-rise buildings are safe and feel safe.

The Data Picture: Housing Standards 
Coverage: England
Over the last decade, the proportion of nondecent homes in England has declined from 35% of the stock in 2007 to 19% in 2017. This decrease was observed across all tenures but has stalled in recent years. In 2017, 13% of dwellings in the social rented sector failed to meet the Decent Homes Standard. This is lower than the proportion of private rented (25%) and owner occupied (19%) homes.

Inclusive planning and supporting community cohesion (11.3, 11.a)
Helping residents take control of planning and management in the places they live is essential; they have the knowledge and enthusiasm to shape, design and improve their neighbourhoods and more and more communities are stepping up to this.
In England’s Community Life Survey: 2017-18, 26% of respondents agreed that they are able to influence decisions affecting their local area. This has remained consistent since 2013-14. Over half of respondents (54%) said they would like to be more involved in the decisions local authorities make which affect their local area.373
Through investments of £34.5 million in neighbourhood planning (2018-22) and £163 million in community housing (2018-20), residents are being given a bigger say over their communities’ future. Residents will decide where new homes, green spaces and other facilities should go and how they should look and feel. 
Activity snapshot:
In England, the Community Partnership Board brings together public and social sector representatives including Locality, Power to Change and the National Council for Voluntary Organisations to ensure that communities are feeding into policymaking. 
Power to Change has provided community groups with business development support, advice and funding to establish communityowned pubs. With £3.6 million of funding, more than 40 communities have taken ownership of their local pub and a further 1,250 have been listed as ‘assets of community value’ demonstrating the role pubs play in regeneration, employment and as local hubs to provide services and amenities to those at risk of social exclusion.
The UK government’s Integrated Communities Strategy Green Paper and subsequent Action Plan set out a vision and plan for building stronger, closer communities where people – whatever their background – live, work, learn and socialise together.
Activity snapshot:
In England, the Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI) has raised awareness on the sustainability of new residential developments. Through the ‘Location of Development’ initiative, the RTPI has produced analysis and data which has been used by local authorities and stakeholder platforms on future developments and to assess their sustainability and collective engagement in achieving Goal 11. This has provided a tool to assess the sustainability of new homes and influence planning policy to ensure housing is being delivered sustainably.
Safeguarding cultural and natural heritage (11.4)
In 2018, there were 5,160 374 buildings or sites on 
Historic England’s Heritage at Risk Register compared to 5,478 375 in 2015, thanks to the imaginative solutions, partnerships and dedication that has been applied to guarding England’s heritage by the public, private and voluntary sectors.
Up to £55 million of the £675 million Future High Streets Fund has been allocated to regenerating heritage high streets across England. This will improve their physical and economic condition, increase community and investor confidence and pride in local places.
Activity snapshot:
Partners and charities across England protect and safeguard culture and world heritage sites in the UK. In England, English Heritage supports and cares for over 400 historic buildings and sites; the Heritage Council raises awareness and works with local communities on national heritage; and Historic England protects and champions key places across England.
Improving resilience to disaster (11.5, 11.b)
England’s 38 Local Resilience Forums bring together local and national stakeholders to work on preventing, handling and recovering from catastrophic incidents and adapting in response and have recently worked to improve communication flows to enhance the resilience of local communities. 
Air quality in cities (11.6)
Linked to the UK-wide Clean Air Strategy around £500 million will fund the development of local plans, some of which include the introduction of charging Clean Air Zones. As of April 2019, 12 local plans have been approved in England and £200 million of funding disbursed.
Access to safe and accessible public spaces (11.7)
Since 2015, 86 pocket parks have been created out of neglected urban spaces in England.376 In 2019, an additional £3.75 million of funding went to the Pockets Parks Plus programme for community groups in England to create and maintain small green oases in their local area. 
Scotland
Scotland’s National Performance Framework (NPF) contains a national outcome that “we live in communities that are inclusive, empowered, resilient and safe”. Although much of the focus in this target is on cities, some of the actions and challenges in this goal have impact beyond cities. The Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act 2015 requires public sector organisations who deliver and resource local services to work together and with local communities, so they can improve outcomes on themes they agree as priorities for their area. 
Scotland’s National Volunteering Outcomes Framework was developed over 2018 by the Scottish Government jointly with partners from the volunteer and community sector, local government and NHS, with academics and social researchers, and with volunteers

Activity snapshot:
The Central Scotland Green Network 
(CSGN) is a long-term initiative which aims to restore and transform the landscape of Central Scotland and to promote environmental quality, woodland cover and recreational opportunities. It covers an area stretching from Ayrshire and Inverclyde in the west to Fife and the Lothians in the east. The initiative aims to make Central Scotland a more attractive place to live in, do business and visit, help absorb carbon dioxide, enhance biodiversity, and promote active travel and healthier lifestyles. The vision states that by 2050, Central Scotland will be transformed into a place where the environment adds value to the economy and where people’s lives are enriched by its quality. 
A range of actions are relevant to empowering communities, including:
• Investment in housing – including the delivery of 
50,000 affordable homes over the 5-year period April 2016 to March 2021 and including 35,000 homes for social rent.
• Scotland supports the delivery of flexible housing capable of being adapted to suit people’s changing requirements. Therefore, wherever possible, all homes are built to Housing for Varying Needs standards. In addition, flexibility continues to exist (if required) in the housing grant subsidy arrangements within the Affordable Housing Supply programme so that specialist housing can be provided in accordance with need, helping disabled people with more complex needs live independently in their own homes and older people to stay in their own homes for longer.
• Investment in transport (£1 billion per year in public and sustainable transport). In 2017/18, out of a total 525 million public transport journeys, 388 million journeys were made by bus, 1.5% less than in 2016/17 and a fall of 8% over the last five years, but still accounting for 74% of all public transport journeys.377 In addition, Scotland is seeking to reduce emissions by: purchasing low emissions buses; phasing out the need for new petrol and diesel-powered cars or vans by 2032; and a £15 million investment plan funding the installation of an additional 1,500 electric vehicle chargers in homes, businesses and on local authority land to support the ChargePlace Scotland Electric Vehicle network.
• In 2015 the Scottish Government published its air quality strategy ‘Cleaner Air for Scotland – The Road to a Healthier Future’ setting out a series of crosscutting policy actions intended to deliver further air quality improvements. An independently-led review of the strategy, reviewing progress to date and identifying priorities for additional action, will be completed by the end of 2019. 
• Participatory budgeting, involving communities more meaningfully in decisions backed by practical support at local and national level.
• Community ownership, including rights to buy and support through the Scottish Land Fund.
• City Region Deals – partnerships between local, Scottish and UK governments to bring about longterm strategic approaches to improving regional economies. 
• Green Infrastructure Strategic Investment Fund where local government, public bodies environmental organisations and communities work together to deliver transformative change in some of Scotland’s most disadvantaged urban areas through the creation and improvement of green spaces.
• Historic Environment Scotland and Scottish Natural Heritage support safeguarding of cultural and natural heritage. 
Tackling homelessness (11.1)
Having somewhere to call home is a basic human right. The Ending Homelessness Together: High level Action Plan, published in November 2018, provides a person-centred approach to individual needs. Putting prevention first, to minimise the risk of people becoming homeless. This includes a commitment to the ‘Housing First’ model, where people are allocated permanent tenancies with intensive wraparound support helping to prevent repeat homelessness. 
The Data Picture: Homelessness
Coverage: Scotland
In 2017/18, local authorities received 34,972 homelessness applications, a small (1%) increase compared to the previous year, breaking a trend in falling numbers of applications since 2008/09 where 57,212 applications were received. The proportion of applications where a household member reported sleeping rough at least once during the 3 months prior to the application was 8% in 2017/18.

Wales
Wales’s national well-being goals recognise the importance of cohesive communities that are attractive, viable, safe and well-connected.
Access to safe and affordable housing for all (11.1) 
Wales’s homelessness legislation has prevented 21,500 households from becoming homeless between April 2015 and December 2018.378 It is also on target to bring 5,000 empty homes back into use, with 3,634 for 2016-17 and 2017-18.379
Wales’s innovative housing programme has invested in new models and approaches to high-quality, near-zerocarbon affordable homes. Nearly 800 houses are under way and due for completion.
Activity snapshot: 
Developed with organisations including Shelter 
Cymru and members of Rough Sleepers Cymru, the Rough Sleeping Action Plan covers a range of activity, supporting people in engaging with services and get off the streets as quickly as possible.
Access to safe and sustainable transport systems (11.2)
Wales is committed to providing access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable, transport systems. The Active Travel (Wales) Act 2013 is transforming walking and cycling infrastructure and encouraging behaviour change. An investment of £2 million is being made in electric vehicle charging points in Wales.380
In 2018, Wales awarded the 15-year, £5 billion Wales and Borders Rail service contract. Transport for Wales will deliver the South Wales Metro, which will also inform the rollout of the model across Wales in North East and South West Wales.381
In Wales older and disabled persons may travel for free on bus services throughout Wales. In 2017-18, almost half of all bus journeys in Wales were by older or disabled passholders.382 Since 2015 Wales has ensured that younger people aged 16 to 18 have received one-third fare discounts on bus fares, and this was extended in 2018 to include 19 to 21-year-olds throughout Wales. 
Planning and community cohesion (11.3, 11.a) 
Wales’s National Planning Policy383 is designed to ensure that planning decisions will improve the lives of both current and future generations and ensure that the planning system contributes towards sustainable development. Wales is developing a National Development Framework (NDF), a 20-year national spatial plan for Wales to coordinate the planning of homes, facilities and infrastructure sustainably.
Activity snapshot:
The Cardiff Capital Region City Deal was agreed in 2016 between the UK government, the Welsh Government and the ten local authorities in South East Wales. With £1.2 billion investment it aims to deliver up to 25,000 new jobs and leverage an additional £4 billion of private investment. 
The National Survey for Wales asked people to what extent they agreed or disagreed that they belong to the local area; people in the area from different backgrounds get on well together; and people in the area treat each other with respect. In 2016-17, 50% of people agreed with all three statements while around 70% agreed with any one statement.384
Activity snapshot: 
Volunteering Wales is a new digital volunteering platform, hosted by the Wales Council for Voluntary Action. It allows volunteers to find opportunities and log their hours and skills gained from volunteering.  More than 3,000 organisations are already  using the platform.
Safeguarding cultural and natural heritage (11.4) 
Welsh is an official language in Wales and an important part of Wales’s heritage. It is promoted and facilitated by the Welsh Language Commissioner. 
The percentage of three to 15-year-olds who spoke Welsh daily was considerably higher than any other age group, with almost a quarter of them speaking Welsh daily. There has been an increase in the percentage of children whose parents said they spoke Welsh at home in the early 2010s, but in recent years has stabilised at around 10.4%.385
The Data Picture: Welsh Language
Coverage: Wales
In 2011, there were approximately 562,000 
Welsh speakers. Wales’s ambition, as set out in Cymraeg 2050: A million Welsh speakers, is for a million people to be able to speak Welsh by 2050. The strategy addresses the need to ensure the viability of Welsh-speaking communities as places that facilitate the use of Welsh in every aspect of life.
Percentage aged 3 or over able to speak Welsh, 1911 to 2011: 
 
While the Census of Population is the key source used to measure the number of Welsh speakers in Wales, the Annual Population Survey (APS) and the National Survey for Wales both also include questions about people’s ability to speak Welsh. These surveys indicate that the proportion of people reporting to have some ability in Welsh has increased slightly over the past decade. Information about the differences between the Census and the APS can be found in this statistical bulletin presenting results on the Welsh language.

2017-18
The Priorities for the Historic Environment of Wales plan outlines how significant historic buildings, parks and heritage sites are to the Welsh economy. In 2016, an estimated £963 million and over 40,000 jobs were contributed to the Welsh economy in the heritage sector, alongside tourism and construction. 
In 2015, the percentage of listed buildings that were in a “stable” or “improving” condition was at 74%386, consistent with previous years.387 Improving resilience to disaster (11.5, 11.b)
The Wales Resilience Forum and Local Resilience Forums connect local and national stakeholders working on preventing, handling and recovering from catastrophic incidents, adapting in response. ‘Community Information on Risks in Wales’ provides information on the range of emergencies that could occur, and suggestions on what the general public and wider community can do. 
Flood Risk Assessment Wales, 2019, estimates 245,118 properties are at risk of flooding in Wales. This includes 117,100 at high risk, 44,668 at medium risk and 83,350 at low risk from all sources. By 2021 Wales will invest over £350 million in flood and coastal erosion risk management activities around Wales. 
In 2019, construction work will start on coastal risk management works as part of a further £150 million programme of investment over three years across Wales.388 The Coastal Risk Management Programme allocates funding for schemes to reduce risk to over 18,000 properties through projects to repair, replace and create new coastal defence systems.
Activity snapshot:
The new £15.7 million coastal defence scheme in West Rhyl has reduced the risk of coastal flooding to around 2,700 properties, including 560 businesses, and provided additional benefits by securing land for retail redevelopment.
Air quality in cities (11.6) 
Wales is improving air quality though a £20 million Air Quality Fund, a draft Clean Air Zone Framework, and temporary speed restrictions on some roads to tackle emissions hotspots. It will consult on a Clean Air Plan in 2019. The Clean Air Wales Programme seeks to reduce the burden of poor air quality on human health and the natural environment and achieve compliance with European and domestic legislative air quality obligations.

Access to safe and accessible public spaces (11.7) 
The Noise and Soundscape Action Plan for Wales sets out plans to tackle noise pollution and improve soundscapes for happier, healthier communities. Noise maps inform a range of activities to be undertaken across Wales between 2018-23.389
In 2016-17, the National Survey for Wales found 73% of people felt safe after dark: at home, walking in their local area, travelling by public transport or travelling by car felt safe in all four situations. Around 80% felt safe walking in the local area or travelling by public transport, while 97% of people felt safe when being at home and travelling by car.390
Northern Ireland
Housing (11.1) 
There were 790,328 dwellings in Northern Ireland in April 2018, a rise of 7,056 (0.9%) from 2017 (783,272).391 Progress is being made on delivering 1,850 new social housing starts before the end of 2019-20 and more than 1000 affordable homes through support for the Co-Ownership scheme. 
Transport (11.2)
The new £90 million Belfast Rapid Transit System introduced in 2018 aimed to encourage a shift from private cars to more sustainable, greener modes of transport, resulting in an increase of over 40,000 passenger journeys per week when compared to Metro usage in the same period of 2017/18.392 Recognising the importance of providing accessible and inclusive public transport systems for disabled people and older people, the Inclusive Mobility Transport Advisory Committee helped design and develop the new Glider Rapid Transit service for Belfast. 
Findings from the most recent Travel Survey for Northern Ireland data estimate that 26% of all journeys made were by walking, cycling or public transport in 2017. This is similar to 2015 (25%) but is an increase from 2010 (20%).393
Transport emissions increased 1.9% from 2015 to 2016 following the inclusion of shipping emissions. 
In the long-term these are now 29.3% higher than in 
1990 reflecting an increased car ownership in Northern 
Ireland.394
Air quality (11.6)
Annual mean levels of nitrogen dioxide averaged across 10 monitoring sites decreased from 37.7 µgm-3 (micrograms per metre cubed) in 2011 to 33.4 µgm3 in 2017.395 This decrease is potentially indicative of a longer-term decline. Air quality improvements have occurred as sustainable transport measures have shifted private car users towards public and active transport means, and also as older vehicles on the roads are replaced with newer vehicles with cleaner engine technologies. This has resulted in air quality improvements across towns and cities in Northern Ireland, particularly those in which there are large volumes of road traffic and/or vehicle congestion. An electric car charging network has been established across Northern Ireland with 470 charging points as of June 2018 (a 2.8% share of UK charging points). The number of charging points in Northern Ireland grew by 3% from June 2017 to June 2018.396
Safe communities and places (11.7)
Hate crimes in all forms, crimes against the elderly, and sectarian crimes all involve a measure of disrespect for another person or their community based on their identity, culture, faith, sexual identity or vulnerability. Reducing crime and reoffending and increasing respect can lead to an increase in the number of and use of shared spaces as well as increase the feeling of safety in shared spaces. The 2017 Northern Ireland Life & Times survey found that around 70% of those asked said all leisure centres, parks libraries and shopping centres are “definitely” shared and open to both Protestants and Catholics. This is a significant increase on the year before (64% average) and is the highest figure recorded to date.397
Planning for Sustainable Development
The fundamentally reformed local planning system has at its heart an increased emphasis on the importance of community participation, good design and positive place-making in furthering sustainable development. This includes the Strategic Planning Policy Statement for 
Northern Ireland ‘Planning for Sustainable Development’ 
(SPPS) and the ‘Living Places Urban Stewardship and Design Guide’ for Northern Ireland (2014) which are designed to ensure the planning system provide for places that encourage healthier living; promote accessibility and inclusivity; and contribute to how places are and feel. As a statement of policy on important matters that should be addressed across Northern Ireland, the SPPS must be taken into account in the preparation of Local Development Plans (LDPs) and the provisions of both documents are material to all decisions on individual planning applications and appeals.
UK action around the world 
Many cities around the world are facing challenges to address rising housing and infrastructure demands to support growing populations and rapid urbanisation, respond to the environmental impact of urban sprawl, and increase resilience and reduce vulnerability to disasters. The UK supports these across a wide range of activities. 
From 2016-22, the UK’s £165 million Cities and Infrastructure for Growth (CIG) programme will be delivering sustainable urban development through direct technical assistance to national and local governments in Burma, Uganda and Zambia. CIG is supporting urban planning, local economic planning, financing urban infrastructure and improved access to urban services. It will expand its support to a new set of partner countries across Africa and Asia. 
Smart cities (11.a, 11.b, 11.c)
The UK supports smarter cities worldwide. With China for example, experiencing the largest urban migration of people in history, China-UK cooperation has helped establish smart-cities standards into China’s compulsory and people-centred “Smart Cities Evaluation Indicator”. 
The indicator evaluates the performance of cities and guides future developments across urban planning, governance and improved services for city dwellers. Focus areas include strategic design, data-sharing, smart transport, healthcare, access to water and sanitation, and cyber safety. 
The Prosperity Fund Future Cities programme will provide £80 million to reduce poverty and promote sustainable, inclusive economic growth in 19 cities across 10 countries. Urban development challenges are being tackled by urban planning, transportation and resilience. In South Africa for example, programming is helping Cape Town to better maintain water and sanitation infrastructure. 
Resilience (11.b)
The UK is active in sharing expertise in dealing with the risk of natural catastrophes, tackling immediate large-scale infrastructure challenges and improving resilience to natural disasters. It is working with the World Bank to support resilience planning in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. From 2015-20, through the £29.6 million Building Urban Resilience for Climate Change programme, the UK is supporting national and local planning for resilient urban areas. 
Activity snapshot:
Concern Worldwide is working with local and international partners in Pakistan to build disaster resilience in vulnerable areas through the Building Disaster Resilience in Pakistan programme. Since 2016, over 1 million people across 700 villages have been reached and the programme is on course to reach another 500,000 people by 2020. Communities are assisted in mitigating and preparing for disasters through improvements to early warning systems, risk information, community-level response systems, and linkages with disaster management authorities. Climate change adaptation measures are also being developed.
Sustainable buildings (11.c)
The UK is partnering with the International Finance Corporation to provide £106 million toward financing and construction of more energy efficient buildings in emerging economies in a programme announced in 2018. Buildings account for around a fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions. Improving their design and construction is key to achieving the Goals.398
The £27.5 million Climate Leadership in Cities Programme initiative supports cities in developing countries to plan for, and implement, ambitious actions through: 
• supporting 15 megacities in Latin America and Asia, to develop climate action plans, delivered by the C40 cities network;399
• expanding the C40 Cities Finance Facility; and
• global research and advocacy to remove barriers to action, delivered by the Coalition for Urban Transitions.
Challenges and next steps
Housing delivery including affordable housing
Meeting the demands for appropriate, affordable housing remains a top priority across the UK. In Northern Ireland 24,148 households using social housing were in housing stress in 2017-18400 a 9.3% increase from 2014-15 (22,097).401
In England, whilst housing development has improved, the current pace is too slow to meet demands. Homes England will be supported to become a more robust, independent delivery agent. This will ensure housing delivery is maximised and targets are met. In Scotland, under the Housing to 2040 programme, the Scottish Government has begun developing a vision for how Scotland’s homes and communities should look and feel in 2040 and the options and choices to get there. An initial period of stakeholder engagement took place in 2018 and further consultation is planned for autumn 2019. Scotland’s long-term spatial strategy for development and infrastructure - National Planning Framework 4 – will be developed following the Planning Bill, currently being considered by the Scottish Parliament.
Homelessness and rough sleeping
While in England in 2018, the number of people sleeping rough on a single night fell for the first time since 2010, the rises in homelessness and rough sleeping seen in previous years remain a major challenge.402 The Rough Sleeping Strategy outlines ambitious commitments, including to halve rough sleeping by 2022. Plans are reinforced by the Homelessness Reduction Act which puts prevention at the heart of local authorities’ response to homelessness. 
The £76 million Rough Sleeping Initiative (RSI) is working with 246 local authorities to help people off the streets and boost the capacity of local authorities. In its first year, the RSI delivered over 1,750 new bed spaces, and helped areas with the highest levels of rough sleeping to hire more than 500 new staff. In 2019, funding will support an estimated 2,600 bed spaces and 750 staff. Eleven Somewhere Safe to Stay hubs across England provide immediate shelter and rapid assessment for rough sleepers and those at risk of doing so. A further 20 were announced in May 2019.403
The LGBT Action Plan outlines commitments to better understand the causes of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) homelessness and how their needs could be better met. Several initiatives are supporting LGBT survivors of domestic abuse, including an LGBT helpline and a local-led project providing independent living accommodation. Inclusive communities
In February 2019, England’s Integrated Communities Action Plan was published. It recognises the importance of ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to progress, no matter their background. From supporting new migrants to settle into communities, to creating opportunities to connect with people from different backgrounds and improving the English language skills offer, the Action Plan includes a range of local and national measures to support stronger, more integrated communities. Integration is a collective endeavour. The Action Plan brings together commitments from partners across civil society, the public sector and government, as well as building an understanding of what works through Innovation Fund projects.
In Northern Ireland, community relations programmes are being delivered annually to improve both intra- and inter-community relations, create new shared and inclusive spaces, promote diversity, inclusion, tolerance, peace, reconciliation and appreciation of different cultures and traditions. These are delivered under the ‘Together: Building a United Community Strategy’ and the Northern Ireland Executives ‘Good Relations Strategy’.
Many communities across the UK have not shared the proceeds of growth in the same way as more prosperous areas. This leaves some communities struggling to prosper and feeling isolated. Stimulating economic growth in areas of greatest need and reconnecting them, physically and digitally, to build a more united and connected nation is essential. In England, the £1.6 billion Stronger Towns Funds aims to address this by creating new jobs, training local people and boosting economic activity – with communities having a say on how the money is spent.404

Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production
Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns
Summary 
The UK is committed to promoting more sustainable consumption, reusing and redistributing products and materials, and promoting better management and recycling of waste. The Greening Government Commitments set out the actions UK government departments and their agencies will take to reduce their impacts on the environment, but citizens and business across the UK are also being encouraged to make the right choices themselves.
The UK is working to preserve material resources by minimising waste, promoting resource efficiency and moving towards a circular economy. The UK’s work on natural capital is helping to ensure that the value of biodiversity and ecosystems informs decision-making. The introduction of the carrier bag charge and landfill tax have already had significant impacts on behaviour. 
This chapter sets out the UK’s approach to promoting sustainable consumption and production patterns, including efforts to reduce waste (such as reducing food waste and tackling plastic pollution). It also looks at UK efforts to ensure the environmentally-sound management of chemicals and efforts to reduce their impact on human health and the environment.
Leave No One Behind examples:
• Sustainable consumption and production can help to reduce future economic, environmental and social costs, strengthen economic competitiveness and reduce poverty. Rethinking the way products are designed, restructuring the way they are provided and increasing reuse, repair, remanufacture and recycling will create societal benefits for all. Application of the polluter pays principle, along with other levers such as regulations, fiscal incentives and the provision of information can encourage the market to deliver a more efficient outcome. Behavioural insights can also complement conventional environmental policy tools.
• The UK government’s 25 Year Environment Plan and new Resources and Waste Strategy will help to maximise the value of the resources used, minimise the amount of waste created, cut emissions and help create a cleaner, greener, healthier planet for everyone.
• In Scotland, there has been a substantial increase in households making use of local authority provided food waste recycling caddies from 26% in 2012 to 55% in 2017 (Scottish Household Survey 2017).
• In 2016, Wales enacted the ‘Environment (Wales) Act’, to plan and manage Wales’s natural resources in a more proactive, sustainable and joined-up way. This legislation, alongside its companion The WellBeing of Future Generations (Wales) Act, positions Wales as a low carbon, green economy, ready to adapt to the impacts of climate change.

Action in the UK
The UK is taking action to manage resources sustainably and to deal with waste responsibly. 
Resources (reducing waste, promoting reuse and recycling) and rationalisation of fossil fuel subsidies (12.2, 12.3, 12.5, 12.c)
The new Resources and Waste Strategy for England was published in December 2018. The Strategy sets out how the UK will preserve its stock of material resources by reducing waste, promoting resource efficiency and moving towards a circular economy (also Goal 8). The UK will also minimise the damage caused to the natural environment by decreasing and managing waste safely and carefully, and by tackling waste crime (also Goals 14 and 15). Key actions include:
• consulting on plans to make producers pay the full cost of dealing with packaging waste, introducing a consistent set of recyclable materials to be collected across England from households and businesses and bringing in a deposit return scheme for drinks cans and bottles;
• voluntary agreements, delivered through the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), aimed at preventing waste in the food, packaging, and clothing sectors; and
• reducing the landfilling of biodegradable municipal waste. The landfill tax escalator has achieved a dramatic impact with a circa 50% fall in manufacturing waste and a 60% fall in waste going to landfill. The UK remains on course to meet obligations to reduce landfilling of biodegradable municipal waste under the Landfill Directive, limiting this to 35% of the 1995 level by 2020.
The UK does not have any fossil fuel subsidies, according to the definition it shares with European G20 partners. The UK also supports the G20 commitment to rationalise and phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption. 

Plastics (12.4, 12.5)
In April 2018 WRAP launched the UK Plastics Pact, a collaborative initiative that is designed to create a circular economy for plastics (also Goal 14). As of 2019, it brings together signatories accounting for over 80% of the plastic packaging placed on the UK market. The Pact focusses on delivering four world-leading targets by 2025:
• taking actions to eliminate problematic or unnecessary single-use packaging items through 
redesign, innovation or alternative (reuse) delivery models;
• 100% of plastic packaging to be reusable, recyclable or compostable;
• 70% of plastic packaging should be effectively recycled or composted; and
• 30% average recycled content across all plastic packaging.
All four nations in the UK have introduced charges to limit the use of plastic bags. A 5 pence singleuse carrier bag charge was introduced in England in October 2015 for retailers with 250 or more employees. WRAP reported that in 2014, the main 
retailers circulated 7.64 billion single-use carrier bags in England.405 UK government Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) data show that the main retailers sold 1.04 billion singleuse carrier bags in 2017/18, a reduction of over 80% on the number of carrier bags since the charge was introduced.406 The UK government recently consulted on proposals to extend and increase the charge. 
The UK has already banned the use of plastic microbeads in rinse-off personal care products. A ban on the supply of plastic straws, drinks stirrers and cotton buds will come into force in England in April 2020 (with exemptions to ensure that those with medical needs or a disability can continue to access plastic straws). The UK government will continue to review the latest evidence on problematic products and/or materials. Food waste (12.3, 12.6, 12.8)
The Data Picture: Food waste
Coverage: UK
Global Target 12.3 is to reduce food waste. In the UK, there was a substantial reduction in household food waste between 2007 and 2015, with the majority of the reduction occurring between 2007 and 2010. Household food waste amounted to 7.3 million tonnes in 2015. 
Total household food waste, million tonnes: 
2007 to 2015
 
Source: Waste and Resources Action Programme, 
Household food waste in the UK 2015
An estimated 10 million tonnes of food and drink are wasted post-farm gate annually in the UK, worth around £20 billion.407 The UK has large-scale interventions in place aimed at reducing food waste across supply chains and within households. WRAP has launched Courtauld 2025 which is an ambitious voluntary agreement that brings together organisations across the food system to make food and drink production and consumption more sustainable.
The UK recently produced a Food Waste Reduction 
Roadmap for the food business to deliver against 
Global Target 12.3. The UK supports WRAP’s ‘Love Food Hate Waste’ campaign which provides advice and guidance to consumers to help them to waste less food and save money. Recycling (12.5)
Household waste recycling rates in England have risen from around 11% in 2000/1 to about 45% in 2017.408 In 2016/17 in England, local authorities recycled, composted or reused 11.3 million tonnes of the waste they collected (far outweighing the 4.1 million tonnes that were landfilled).409
The Data Picture: Recycling rates

Source: Defra, Waste data flow statistics
A consultation was launched in February 2019 to gather views on a consistent set of recyclable materials and consistent labelling on packaging. 
The UK also supports WRAP’s consumer-facing campaign on recycling ‘Recycle Now’ used by over 90% of English local authorities which encourages positive recycling attitudes and behaviours.
Activity snapshot:
Manchester Metropolitan University and the University of Manchester have joined forces with Manchester City Council and the British Heart Foundation to address waste generation from transient student populations. The ‘Give it Don’t Bin it Partnership’ is motivating Manchester’s student population to donate unwanted items by distributing donation packs and encouraging donation of food to Manchester City Foodbank and items for resale in British Heart Foundation shops. The campaign has raised up to £1.3 million since the partnership began.
Greening Government and sustainable supply chains (12.6, 12.7)
The UK’s Greening Government Commitments set out the actions UK government departments and their agencies will take to reduce their impact on the environment. These commitments aim to reduce the environmental impact of government operations, including through procuring more sustainable products. Departments have already achieved a 39% reduction in emissions compared to a 2009/10 baseline; diverted 87% of waste from landfill; halved paper consumption and reduced the number of domestic flights taken by civil servants and ministers by 28%.410
Activity snapshot:
23% of London’s wardrobes are unworn. The 23% Campaign by UK charity TRAID is helping to put Londoners’ 123 million items of unworn clothes back into use by providing a free home collection service to those who want to pass on their unworn clothes to someone else. Londoners who participate receive an email with estimated water and carbon dioxide savings, while money raised from selling the clothes in TRAID charity shops is used to support organic cotton farmers in Ethiopia and Benin. Since the campaign launched 221 tonnes of clothes have been passed on to TRAID.
The UK supports the sustainability of supply chains for example through the Sustainable Clothing Action Plan; a voluntary, industry-led framework which aims to minimise the environmental impacts of the clothing industry. So far over 80 organisations across the UK have made a pledge to reduce their carbon and water footprints by 15%, and waste by 3% per tonne of clothing by 2020. 
The UK government also supports WRAP’s ‘Love Your Clothes’ campaign which aims to raise awareness of the value of clothes and encourage people to make the most of the clothes they already have. 
Access to sustainability information (12.8) and tools for monitoring impact of sustainable tourism (12.b)
Providing clear and credible information to consumers is key to supporting remanufacturing and resource efficient business models. The Ecodesign directive has been used to improve the environmental performance of products and reduce energy and resource consumption. The UK uses the EU Ecolabel scheme to help provide consumers with better information on the sustainability of their purchases through product labelling.
The tourism industry in the UK accounted for around 6.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2016411 and the British Tourist Authority (VisitBritain) works on tourism issues. Sustainability is being considered as part of the proposed Tourism Sector Deal,412 including in terms of reducing the negative impacts of seasonality and focussing on clean growth. The tourism sector has the potential to make a significant contribution to the Goals and work is underway across the UK to support these ambitions.
Chemicals and hazardous waste (12.4)
The UK advocates for tough measures to improve chemical management and safety internationally. The UK has ratified and complies with four international United Nations Conventions413 and is also active in the multi-stakeholder, multi-sectoral voluntary framework of the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM).
Emissions of hazardous substances have declined significantly in the UK between 1990 and 2016. In particular, by 2017 the total UK emissions of Polychlorinated Biphenyls reduced by 92% from levels in 1990.414
The UK is also working to address legacy issues including Persistent Organic Pollutants in products and their disposal. The UK is exploring policy options to introduce a waste tracking system and establish a National Materials Database. 

UK emissions of mercury to air have declined by 94% over the last 50 years. This is a result of tighter regulatory controls and restrictions.415 The UK government committed in its 25 Year Environment Plan to reduce remaining land-based emissions of mercury to air and water by 50% by 2030.
Reports to the Pollution Inventory from regulated industries in England show that emissions to controlled waters from regulated industries have remained relatively constant between 140 to 220 kg per annum.416 
Hazardous waste accounts for 2% of UK waste, with 4.3 million tonnes consigned in 2014.417 The 2010 Strategy for Hazardous Waste Management in England set out important principles that aim to reduce hazardous waste. The UK has also ratified the Basel Convention, which includes a global control mechanism for the import and export of hazardous and other wastes. An Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Decision (C(2001)107/FINAL) also provides a mechanism for controlling the movements of wastes destined for recovery. The Convention and Decision have been fully implemented in UK law. The UK Plan for Shipments of Waste provides stricter controls on the movement of waste destined for disposal, generally prohibiting their import and export. The UK will continue to engage through the Basel Convention to improve the quality of plastic waste exported for recycling. 
Scotland
Circular economies and waste reduction (12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4, 12.6)

Scotland published its circular economy strategy Making Things Last in 2016 and partners in Scotland are working to promote and showcase more circular practices. A Circular Economy Investment Fund offers £18 million as grant funding to small- and mediumsized enterprises who are helping to create a more circular economy. There are many area-based initiatives such as in Tayside, Glasgow and Edinburgh which are based on partnership approaches between Chambers of Commerce, local authorities and others.
Growing the nation in ways that make Scotland’s natural capital available for future generations is the core of One Planet Prosperity, Scottish Environment Protection Agency’s (SEPA) regulatory strategy. 
Through the strategy SEPA is developing ambitious and innovative approaches that help the businesses it regulates to reduce water, energy and materials use in ways that improve businesses’ profitability and longterm viability. 
The Data Picture: Recycling
Coverage: Scotland
By 2030, the globe needs to substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse (Global Target 12.5). In 2017 the Scottish household waste recycling rate was 45.6%, an increase of 0.6 percentage points from 2016. The amount of household waste recycling in 2017 was 1.12 million tonnes.
Scottish household waste recycling rates: 
2014-2017
 
Source: Scottish Government, Scottish 
Environment Protection Agency
Scotland has targets for waste reduction: 33% reduction in waste by 2025, waste prevention (15% reduction in waste from 2011) and recycling (70%) for 2025, as well as targets and regulations to reduce landfilled waste (banning biodegradable municipal waste to landfill from 2021 and setting a target of just 5% of all waste going to landfill by 2025).
Scotland has developed the Scottish Household Recycling Charter which seeks to provide more consistent collection and make it easier for people to recycle the right things and support the creation of new jobs in Scotland.
Other relevant actions include sustainable tourism, and campaigns to reduce food waste. The Food Waste Reduction Action Plan was launched in April 2019 and will take a sector-based approach to tackle food waste in Scotland. By the end of 2019 there will be public consultations on removing the current rural exemption for food waste collection, mandatory food redistribution for businesses of a certain size and the possibility of mandatory food waste reporting in Scotland.
Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme will deal with empty drinks containers aiming to bring an increase in recycling, improve the quality of material collected for recycling, help combat littering, and prevent plastic and other materials polluting rivers, oceans and countryside. 
The Expert Panel on Charges and other measures is considering how best to move forward action on single-use plastic items taking account of the needs and rights of people with disabilities. The Scottish Government has already taken action on plastic cotton buds and microbeads. The Expert Panel is also considering how to tackle the dependence on singleuse coffee cups. 
Activity snapshot:
Keep Scotland Beautiful and Paper Cup 
Recovery and Recycling Group (PCRRG) have launched Scotland’s first single-use cup recycling initiative Cup Movement in Glasgow, where an estimated 95 million disposable cups are used annually. The initiative aims to tackle the city’s single-use cup waste problem by improving recycling infrastructure and encouraging Glaswegians to change their behaviours. The partners are working with retailers, local authorities and other key organisations to install cup collection points across the greater Glasgow area and display educational posters aimed at encouraging consumers to switch to reusable cups, or to recycle their disposable ones. Progress will be tracked throughout 2019 with the aim to gather evidence on this type of mode, for potential wider adoption in the future.
Sustainable procurement (12.7)
Scotland has a range of sustainable procurement measures in place. The Procurement Reform (Scotland) Act 2014 includes a Sustainable Procurement Duty that requires public bodies to consider how procurement could be used to improve social, economic and environmental well-being and enable small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), supported businesses and the third sector to access contract opportunities. Statutory guidance and sustainable procurement 
tools have been developed to help buyers consider a range of social, economic and environmental factors including: climate change; employment, skills and training; equality; and fair and ethical training.
Wales
Strategic framework (12.1, 12.2)
To decrease Wales’s ecological footprint, Wales is adopting more sustainable ways of managing natural resources and is changing the ways goods are consumed and produced. In 2016, Wales enacted the Environment (Wales) Act, to plan and manage Wales’s natural resources in a more proactive, sustainable and joined-up way. This legislation sets the strategic landscape for Wales’s transition to a more circular economy. A new Resource Efficiency Strategy and Circular Economy Route map will be consulted on later this year, detailing next steps towards zero waste. 
Sustainable waste management (12.3)
Wales’s waste strategy Towards Zero Waste sets out how the Welsh Government will deal with waste in a way that produces benefits for not only the environment, but also for the Welsh economy and people’s well-being in Wales. Wales plans to become a zero-waste nation by 2050. 
Wales has also made significant progress in recent years in reducing the amount of food unnecessarily thrown away. Wales was the first nation in the UK to introduce a landfill allowances scheme to reduce the amount of biodegradable municipal waste sent to landfill. 99% of households in Wales can access weekly food waste collections, diverting large amounts of waste away from landfill.418 Figures show a reduction of household food waste in Wales of 12% per person between 2009 and 2015.419
The Data Picture: Household 
Recycling
Coverage: Wales
Increased recycling is instrumental in achieving Wales’s aim of becoming a zero-waste nation. Wales is the third best household recycling nation in the world, as local authority recycling rates rose from 60% in 2015/16, to 64% in 2016/17.

Sustainable practices (12.6, 12.7)
Good sustainable procurement practice is promoted through the 10 principles of Wales Procurement Policy Statement to maximise the impact of the £6 billion annual public procurement spend in Wales. As a result, Wales-based suppliers won 52% of this annual expenditure in 2018, up from 35% in 2004.
The Sustainability Risk Assessment (SRA) ensures sustainability is addressed at the planning stage. The SRA is required for all procurements over £25,000 and is used to identify and mitigate sustainability risks and to maximise sustainability opportunities. 
Visit Wales has developed a number of programmes and tools over recent years aimed at helping destinations as well as individual businesses become more sustainable. Cadw, Wales’s historic environment service, has been actively integrating ‘best practice’ towards carbon reduction both across the properties in the care of Welsh Ministers and the wider historic environment. 
Wales uses a range of measures to influence sustainable behaviours. In 2011, Wales became the first nation in the UK to introduce a minimum charge of 5 pence on all single-use carrier bags. The policy has resulted in a significant reduction in their use. In 2018, Wales enacted the Landfill Disposals Tax Act, to ensure the environmental cost of landfilling waste is identified and encourage greater prevention, reuse, recycling and recovery of waste. The tax is paid when waste is disposed of to landfill and is charged by weight. The Act includes provisions for charging tax on unauthorised disposals of waste, creating a financial deterrent for people seeking to dispose of waste illegally. 
In 2008 Wales became the world’s first Fair Trade Nation, and to-date, 68 Welsh towns and counties have achieved Fairtrade status. Many public bodies, including the Welsh Government, now procure Fairtrade products such as tea, coffee and sugar as standard.
Northern Ireland
Within Northern Ireland, rates of household waste that is reused, recycled or composted, has increased from 39.8% in 2012/13 to 48.1% in 2017/18.420 The ‘waste from households’ rate for 2017/18 is 47%. Recycling of household waste has increased with improvements of 2 and 4 percentage points respectively over the last two years. This represents very positive progress.421
Within Northern Ireland, the Food Waste Regulations and other support to the waste management strategy have helped to drive increases in rates of reuse, recycling or composting of household waste.
Activity snapshot:
Keep Northern Ireland Beautiful and 
Sustainable Northern Ireland are working in partnership on a project to address the production, consumption and littering of singleuse plastics in Northern Ireland. This has involved work with local councils, businesses, schools and the general public and will be extended in due course. The work has involved high levels of stakeholder engagement, evidence gathering and sharing of good practice to encourage behavioural change across all sectors. 
Business in the Community Northern Ireland delivers a Circular Economy Business programme which aims to support companies in reducing waste, adopting sustainable use of natural resources, and contributing to local economic growth.
Activity snapshot:
Business in the Community Northern 
Ireland also delivers the annual Northern Ireland Environmental Benchmarking Survey, which encourages adoption of environmentallysustainable business measures, improvement in performance in areas such as resource efficiency, waste reduction and energy consumption, adoption of renewables and environmental innovation.
The Blue Flag and Green Key programmes, run by Keep Northern Ireland Beautiful, assist the hospitality sector to adopt sustainable consumption and production patterns through the efficient use of natural resources, sound management and the reduction of chemicals and waste and the promotion of sustainable public procurement practices.
UK action around the world 
Resources (waste, reuse, recycling) (12.1)
The UK leads internationally on waste prevention and management and continues to engage in global forums such as the 12.3 Champions Group, United Nations Environment (UNE), the G20 and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). The UK is also playing an active part in the 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns (10YFP) adopted at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) in 2012.
The UK is directly involved in the United Nations 
Environment Programme (UNEP) Consumer Information 
Programme as one of only five countries on the Advisory and Steering Committee. In addition, the UK will also continue supporting the wider work of the 10YFP as a member of the Western Europe and Others Regional Group. Efforts will be focussed on measures which impact on both ends of the supply chain and which are aimed at improving resource efficiency.
The UK government is funding a project with UNEP called Global Industrial Symbiosis Programme (GISP) to help participating countries increase their ambition in reducing emissions and help deliver actions. 
The UK is fully engaged in promoting resource efficiency as a member of the G7. The G7 Alliance for Resource Efficiency brings together business, academia and policymakers to share best practice and case studies not only within the G7 but with emerging economies as well.
Chemicals (including plastics) (12.4, 12.a)
In April 2018 the UK and co-chair Vanuatu announced the Commonwealth Clean Ocean Alliance (CCOA), a ground-breaking initiative working with Commonwealth partners to reduce marine plastic pollution (Goal 12 targets 12.4, 12.5, 12.6, 12.a and also 14.1), commit to action on plastics, share best practice, leverage funding and push for global action. The UK has also committed over £55 million to drive research and innovation globally and support developing countries stop plastic from entering the oceans. 
The UK has signed up to the G7 Ocean Plastic Charter to move toward a more resource-efficient and sustainable approach to the management of plastics across their lifecycle. 
The UK is already taking steps towards the sound management of chemicals and waste (also Goal 14). The UK government contributed £210 million in the period 
2014 to 2017 to the Global Environment Facility (GEF).422 This supports projects on chemicals and waste issues in developing countries, particularly issues associated with the Conventions and the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM).
As a member of a Ministerial High Ambition alliance for chemicals and waste, the UK is raising awareness, promoting accountability, cooperation and international action on chemicals and waste to protect human health and the environment.
The UK is helping to shape SAICM’s post-2020 framework and improve chemical management in countries across the world. The UK is also working with international partners within the OECD’s Environment, Health and Safety Programme to develop tools and guidance that can be used by regulatory agencies and industry worldwide in assessing chemical safety. These are used to risk assess chemicals on the market, including new technologies such as nanomaterials, and to reduce adverse impacts of chemicals on human health and the environment.
Challenges and next steps
Resources and waste
In the last few years recycling services have continued to evolve with new material streams being added and changes to frequency of collections. Consequently, people need to stay up-to-date with what to recycle and how. 
Changing consumer behaviours can be challenging. The right infrastructure can help to change society’s mindset, as will appropriate enforcement measures that nudge people to ‘do the right thing’. The policies in the Resources and Waste Strategy for England seek to speed up this process – helping people value the resources that pass through their hands and helping them to keep those resources in use. 
Despite advances in technology in recent decades, the average lifespan of many products is actually lower than it was 20 years ago. It will be challenging to extend the lives of products through repair, reuse and remanufacture. It is also challenging to help consumers recycle the materials they contain and dispose of them in the most environmentally sensitive ways. 
In Scotland the implementation of a deposit return scheme is an important next step, and closely linked to actions to respond to the pressing issue of climate change.
Improving the data available through a measurement framework for waste reduction will support Scotland’s progress to this Goal.
Further shifts in consumer behaviour will require work and collaboration across Scotland. The complexity and length of supply chains can make it challenging to regulate production and standards with regards to materials used, product design and good practice.
The Welsh Government will be consulting during 2019 on plans to increase recycling targets and halve food waste in Wales by 2025 in Wales’s forthcoming waste strategy. The consultation will include a routemap to Wales moving towards a circular economy.
Food waste
The UK is at the forefront of international efforts to find simpler and cheaper methods to measure food waste. WRAP is currently working with UNE and FAO to develop reporting tools that enable as many countries to report as possible.
The Resource and Waste Strategy for England sets out further measures on food waste including to:
• more effectively redistribute food to those who need it most before it can go to waste;
• consult on annual reporting of food surplus and waste by food businesses;
• consult on legal powers to introduce food waste targets and surplus food redistribution obligations;
• publish a new food surplus and waste hierarchy;
• promote awareness of the issue by appointing a new food waste champion; and
• support cross-sector collaboration through the Courtauld 2025 agreement.
Scotland’s Food Waste Reduction Action Plan sets out the following measures:
• consult on annual reporting of food surplus and waste by food businesses and potential national food waste reduction targets;
• consult on removing the current Scottish rural exemption for food waste collection;
• consult on obligations for food retail sites over a certain size to ensure they redistribute edible products in line with the food waste hierarchy;
• establish a Food Waste Hub which would become a one stop shop for expertise on food waste in Scotland and coordinate action and research; and
• promote awareness of the issue by running targeted communication and marketing campaigns.
Sustainable supply chains
The Global Resource Initiative (GRI) is being established to ensure that the UK’s global commodity supply chain footprint on land, natural resources and ecosystems is sustainable, avoids deforestation and other environmental degradation, and supports jobs, livelihoods and investment in resilient and sustainable food systems. In 2019, the UK is convening a high-level GRI Taskforce to prepare and publish a report with ambitious and practical recommendations to promote sustainable supply chains. 
Minimum Ecodesign requirements have been used in the UK and elsewhere to transform the design of energy-using products to reduce energy consumption. The UK wants to see the requirements expanded to include material efficiency, gradually remove from the market the least resource-efficient products and establish a minimum level of resource efficiency. Tackling plastic pollution 
Five million tonnes of plastic are used in the UK every year. Plastics are found in clothes and shoes, in products on supermarket shelves, in vehicles and buildings. Without action between 2015 and 2025 marine plastic pollution is set to treble world-wide to 150 million tonnes.423
The UK priority will continue to be preventing plastic entering the environment and eliminating avoidable plastic waste over the lifetime of the UK government’s 25 Year Environment Plan. However, in identifying alternatives to plastic it is important to avoid unintended consequences and clarify understanding of the trade-offs of different products and materials. The UK government has made upwards of £100 million of funding available for research and innovation on plastic waste. 
The Scottish Government have established an Expert Panel to advise on difficult to recycle plastic items, like single-use disposable beverage cups. 
Chemicals
In order to ensure the sound management of chemicals and waste, the UK government will publish a strategy to set out its future approach to chemicals. The UK government also aims to establish practical means of tracking chemicals in products to reduce barriers to recycling, reduce risks from harmful chemicals and manage waste safely; and strengthen the international standardisation of methods that assess chemicals safety. 
The UK undertakes intelligence-led compliance checks preventing illegal exports of waste to make sure waste is dealt with in an environmentally-sound manner. The UK is also working to ensure the highest standards of protections for consumers, workers, and the environment are maintained in trade agreements. The UK will play a lead role in developing goals for international chemical management beyond 2020 and will support countries to develop effective chemical and waste management regimes. Further research and development may be needed to develop methods to identify substances of concern and support other countries in doing the same.

Goal 13: Climate Action
Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts
Summary
Tackling climate change threats demands action from all countries. The UK has seen extensive public and parliamentary interest in acting on climate change and sustainable energy. The UK takes a leading role internationally in reducing its own emissions and helping other countries to reduce theirs. 
The UK was the first country in the world to introduce legally-binding emission reduction targets under the Climate Change Act 2008 and has made significant strides in decarbonising its economy. The UK was among the first to ratify the Kigali amendment to the UN Montreal Protocol, which commits nations to reducing hydrofluorocarbon greenhouse gases (HFCs) by 85% between 2019 and 2036. The UK government’s 25 Year Environment Plan and its Clean Growth Strategy contain ambitious proposals on housing, business, power, transport, the natural environment and green finance. The UK commissioned the Committee on Climate Change to provide independent advice on its long-term emission targets and the UK government and the devolved administrations have been quick to respond to the Committee’s latest recommendations. The UK’s International Climate Finance (ICF), which is at least £5.8 billion from 2016-2020, helps developing countries mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change, build resilience to climate change (anticipate, cope with and adapt to changes), reduce deforestation and pursue clean economic growth. Nature-based solutions are crucial for climate mitigation and adaptation, as well as for addressing biodiversity loss.
Action on climate change is central to progress on each of the Goals and is required now to protect the world for future generations. This chapter focusses on the actions the UK is taking to strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards, and on how climate change is integrated into UK legislation and respective national policies. It also sets out efforts to improve awareness of climate change.
Leave No One Behind examples:
• The very poorest are likely to be hit hardest and first by the impacts of climate change. The UK’s International Climate Finance (ICF) directs resources to both adaptation and mitigation to reduce vulnerability to shocks while reducing global emissions. Under the International Development Act (Gender Equality) 2014 the UK will prioritise the needs of women and girls in its development spending.
• The Scottish Government’s Climate Challenge Fund has provided 1,097 grants totalling more than £101 million to 658 communities to support their move to low carbon living. The projects themselves cover activities that help deliver Goal 13 such as increasing the energy efficiency of community buildings, food growing, cutting waste, and the expansion of active and sustainable transport options. Projects aim to improve the climate literacy of their communities and must have a measurable carbon emissions reduction.
• The Welsh Government will establish a climate justice advisory group to explore how the transition away from a fossil fuel-based economy to a low carbon future could impact on Welsh industries and the communities, to collectively develop measures to decarbonise to a low carbon economy that is fair and maximises well-being opportunities for all.

Action in the UK
Strengthening resilience and adaptive capacity (13.1)
Climate change is not just a future challenge-experts are already observing changes in the UK’s climate. The rate of deaths in England and Wales from exposure to natural forces stood at 0.8 per million population in 2016, up from 0.6 per million population in 2015.424 Projections show an increased chance of milder, wetter winters and hotter, drier summers along with an increase in the frequency and intensity of extremes.425
The National Adaptation Programme, which is primarily for England, sets out what government and others will be doing to be ready for the challenges of climate change. It forms part of the five-yearly cycle of requirements laid down in the Climate Change Act 2008 to drive a dynamic and adaptive approach to building the UK’s resilience to climate change. The UK government is also required to publish a UK-wide Climate Change Risk Assessment every five years. This serves as a foundation to understanding the specific risks and opportunities that climate change poses to the UK. The UK is also encouraging action on building resilience outside government, through the Adaptation Reporting Power. Under this power, infrastructure groups and public bodies are invited to report on their preparedness for climate change. 88 organisations, including a range of infrastructure providers, regulators, and public bodies, have confirmed their participation in the third round of reporting so far.426
Activity snapshot:
The Low Carbon Business Network connects firms that put care for the environment at the heart of their business practices. Delivered by the University of Derby (Derby Business School and Institute of Innovation in 
Sustainable Engineering), in partnership with Derby City and Derbyshire County Councils, it encourages the development of new technologies and innovative ways of thinking to improve operations and business models.
The Data Picture: Warming by 2100 
Coverage: Global
In the 2015 Paris Agreement, the UK and other countries made a commitment to limit warming to well below 2°C and pursue efforts for 1.5°C. If governments act on pledges they made under the Paris Agreement, then Climate Action Tracker (CAT) estimate that global warming could be limited to about 3.0°C above the pre-industrial levels (still double the 1.5°C limit).
With governments following their current policies, since 2015, CAT’s estimate on average warming temperatures has decreased by 0.3°C.
Based on current pledges, average warming temperatures have increased by 0.3°C since 2015 and if governments do not act, CAT estimate the world will warm by up to 4.5°C by 2100. Average warming (°C) projected by 2100

£2.6 billion is also being invested between April 2015 and March 2021 to better protect the country from flooding and coastal erosion. This includes over 1,500 schemes, which will better protect 300,000 homes in that period. The Environment Agency regularly reviews the investment programme to take into account serious flooding, local partnership funding contributions and new flood risk information. The latest update was in 
March 2019.427
The UK government has already committed to the largest increase in public spending for investment in science, research and innovation in almost 40 years.428 This will be invested to catalyse low carbon innovation across multiple sectors of the economy. The UK has also committed to upgrading the digital, energy, transport, housing, water and flood defence infrastructure, including through investment in the National Productivity Investment Fund, with annual central government infrastructure investment rising each year from around £2 billion in 2016/17 to over £5 billion in 2020/21. These investments will strengthen market demand for the innovative new clean energy technologies and services that businesses are creating. 
The UK is developing and implementing nature-based solutions through the Clean Growth Strategy, for example, by providing funding for woodland expansion and peatland restoration. In addition, as part of the implementation of the UK government 25 Year Environment Plan, £50 million of funding has been announced for a new Woodland Carbon Guarantee to stimulate domestic carbon offsetting and incentivise new tree planting; and £10 million of funding in the October 2018 Budget for a Challenge Fund to plant and maintain at least 100,000 urban trees and contribute towards planting one million new trees in urban areas.429

Integrating climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning (13.2)
The Climate Change Act 2008 introduced the world’s first legally-binding target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% by 2050 relative to 1990 levels.430 Following the report in October 2018 by the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on the impacts of 1.5°C of warming, the UK commissioned its independent advisers, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) to provide advice on its long-term targets. The CCC recommended that the UK legislates for a net zero target and in June 2019 the UK government laid draft legislation to set a new net zero greenhouse gas emissions target for the UK, to be delivered by 2050. This world-leading target will bring to an end the UK’s contribution to climate change.
UK emissions were 42% below 1990 levels in 2017.431 
To ensure steady progress, the Climate Change Act 2008 requires the UK government to set intermediate targets or ‘carbon budgets’. These are caps on emissions across the UK during a five-year period and are amongst the most stringent targets in the world. The UK has legislated for five carbon budgets to date, requiring a 57% cut in emissions by 2028-2032 from a 1990 baseline.
Under the Climate Change Act 2008, the UK is mandated to address climate change through adaptation frameworks and activities. The principal adaptation activities of the UK are currently reported in the Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA); the National Adaptation Programme (NAP); and the Adaptation Reporting Power (ARP). See section 13.1 for information.
The UK government has put the transition to clean growth at the heart of its Industrial Strategy and is committed to making the UK a global leader in low- carbon jobs, investment and exports. The UK is making progress across the economy to support that transition, including through the development of a Green Finance Strategy; the announcement of missions to halve the energy use of new buildings by 2030 and to establish the world’s first net zero cluster by 2040; the commitment to end the sale of conventional petrol and diesel cars by 2040; and publication of an action plan for Carbon Capture, Usage and Storage.

Activity snapshot:
Energy company SSE has committed to invest around £4 billion in renewables and electricity networks in the UK over the five years to 31 March 2023. It works with supply partners, such as Siemens and Balfour Beattie, investment partners such as Greencoat and CIP, and community groups and organisations in the places where the developments are located.
Improving education and awareness-raising on climate change mitigation (13.3)
The UK government is working to ensure that across society, people understand the challenges and risks which lie ahead. The UK’s world-leading economic, science and technical skills (including, for example, its scientists at the Met Office, the landmark 2006 Stern Report and the New Climate Economy report) have shaped the global debate around climate change. Under the 2018-2021 Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme, the Met Office have increased their commitment to communicating climate change to a wider range of audiences. The Met Office has made its climate observations, predictions and projections more accessible online including by adding interactive webpages on climate change impacts at global and UK scale, and its new Climate Programme will continue to focus on exploring innovative ways to visualise and communicate climate data. 
The UK recognises the importance of teaching young people about climate change. The natural and manmade causes of climate change are studied in the primary and secondary curriculum, while in 2017 a new environmental science A-level was introduced. This will enable pupils to study topics that will support their understanding of climate change and how it can be tackled.
As part of a wider ‘Engaging Environments’ initiative, the Natural Environments Research Council (NERC) is funding two projects to improve public engagement on climate change: the Climate Communications Project and Climate Stories.The former is led by the University of Leeds and aims to develop the national infrastructure to deliver high-impact public engagement. The latter is led by the University of Exeter and focusses on developing the narrative skills of scientists and evaluating the use of storytelling as a method to engage a diverse range of community groups.Scotland 
Tackling climate change is a defining challenge and a moral imperative. The First Minister of Scotland declared a global climate emergency in April 2019 and Scotland is acting accordingly. Scotland’s contribution to climate change will end within a generation. Scotland has already almost halved emissions since 1990 while growing the economy, increasing employment and productivity.432 Scotland’s transition to a net zero economy will be just and fair to everyone. 
Integration into national policies, strategies and planning (13.2)
Scotland has a long-established statutory framework for mitigating and adapting to climate change, which is subject to ongoing scrutiny and review. The Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 introduced ambitious targets to reduce Scotland’s emissions by at least 80% by 2050. As well as domestic emissions, Scotland was the first country in the world to include a fair share of emissions from international aviation and shipping in its targets and to mandate that Scotland achieve its goals by domestic effort alone.
As well as setting the statutory basis for emission reductions, the Act additionally requires all public bodies in Scotland who appear on the ‘Major Player’ list to submit an annual report on compliance with their climate change duties. Local government has made a political commitment to combatting climate change, through the Covenant of Mayors for Climate and 
Energy. The full scale of such activity is captured in the annual reports produced as part of the public bodies reporting duty. The reports set out progress made with reducing carbon emissions and adapting to climate change across the public sector including the National Health Service, local authorities, transport authorities, government agencies and universities and colleges. The reports are published on the Sustainable Scotland Network website. 
In 2018, Scotland became one of the first countries to respond to the United Nations Paris Agreement with legislation when it introduced the new Climate Change Bill to the Scottish Parliament in May 2018 to raise the ambition of its domestic emissions reduction targets in line with the Agreement. The targets in the Bill have been further updated in response to the publication of the Committee on Climate Change’s advice to set a legally binding target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045. 
Policies and proposals through which Scotland’s statutory emissions reduction targets from 2017-2032 will be met are set out in the Scottish Government’s third Climate Change Plan (RPP3), published in February 2018. The policies and proposals in the Plan include plans for the energy, buildings, transport, industry, waste, land use, land use change and forestry, and agriculture sectors. This Plan will be updated six months after the new Climate Change Bill receives Royal Assent.
The Scottish Government has also set up a Just Transition Commission to provide Ministers with practical advice on decarbonising in a way that it fair for all.
Strengthening resilience and adaptation (13.1)
Scotland’s first five-year climate change adaptation programme from 2014 addressed over 130 climate risks through around 150 individual policies and proposals. The second five-year programme will be published in 2019.
Specialised support on climate adaptation is provided through the Adaptation Scotland Programme, funded by the Scottish Government and delivered by sustainability charity Sniffer, which has supported important regional initiatives delivering on adaptation (for example the Galloway and Southern Ayrshire 
Biosphere Reserve, Climate Ready Clyde, Edinburgh Adapts and Aberdeen Adapts) and has increasing engagement with the business community. Through Adaptation Scotland, organisations, businesses and communities are supported to adapt to the impacts of climate change through connecting science and practice and building partnerships for planning and action. 
Improving education and awareness (13.3)
Survey data from the Scottish Household Survey published in 2018 show that the proportion of young people (age 16-24) who see climate change as an immediate and urgent problem increased by over half from 38% in 2013 to 58% in 2017. Among adults of all ages this proportion increased by one third from 46% to 61% during the same period.433 Examples of efforts to improve education and awareness-raising include:
• the Royal Scottish Geographic Society developing a climate literacy qualification;
• Public workshops across Scotland in summer 2019 will inform development of new public engagement strategy;
• 2050 Climate Group’s Young Leaders Development Programme gives young people the knowledge, skills and opportunities to take climate action;
• Keep Scotland Beautiful runs the Eco-Schools Scotland Programme; and
• ‘Climate Ready Classrooms’ in secondary schools.
The Scottish Government will also engage the public, communities, businesses, industry and the public sector in a discussion about what more can be done.
Wales
Climate adaptation (13.1)
Wales has just consulted on its second Adaptation 
Plan. Wales’s first Climate Change Adaptation Delivery 
Plan sits within the Climate Change Strategy for Wales. Published in 2010, it laid the foundations for a significant step towards a resilient Wales. Since 2010, Wales’s achievements have included the publication and implementation of strategies to address flood and coastal erosion risk management, completion of impact assessments to understand the effects of climate change in the historic environment and the implementation of a heat-wave plan for Wales.
Climate policies (13.2)
The Environment (Wales) Act 2016 sets a target of at least an 80% emissions reduction in 2050 with a carbon budgeting framework with five yearly reporting cycles. In 2020, the Welsh Government will bring regulations to the National Assembly to increase the existing 2050 target to 95% and change Wales’s interim targets and carbon budgets as necessary. In December 2018, the National Assembly for Wales passed regulations for interim targets (for 2020, 2030 and 2040) and Wales’s first two carbon budgets. Prosperity for All: A Low Carbon Wales Delivery Plan, was launched in March 2019 which sets out how Wales will meet its first carbon budget (2016-2020). The Plan sets out 100 policies and proposals, broken down by all portfolios, which demonstrate collective Cabinet commitment to accelerate the transition to a low carbon economy in the years ahead. The National Assembly for Wales declared a climate emergency in 
May 2019 and the Welsh Government is reviewing the 2050 target following developments in climate science.
The Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 establishes Public Service Boards (PSBs) for each Local Authority in Wales, made up from representatives of public bodies including Local Authorities, Health Boards, Fire and Rescue and Natural Resources Wales. Each PSB must improve the economic, social, environmental and cultural well-being of its area by developing a Well-being Plan, and each plan must be informed by a Well-being Assessment. The Act requires PSBs to take the latest Climate Change Risk Assessment into account when developing their Wellbeing Assessments.
Climate change education and awareness raising (13.3)
Wales supports many activities that provide opportunities for young people to contribute to tackling climate change, including the EcoSchools programme which, in 2017/18, 97% of all Welsh state schools were registered on - one of the highest participation rates in the world.434
That “children and young people develop as ethical, informed citizens who consider the impact of their actions when making choices” is one of four purposes of the new curriculum for Wales. The new curriculum will challenge and support learners to make informed decisions that affect their world and well-being. The choices they make depend on many factors, including moral viewpoints and personal beliefs. However, robust evidence provides a solid foundation on which to base decisions. As ethically informed citizens, they will need to consider the impact of their actions and technological developments on Wales and the wider world, with the aim of having young people who are ethical, informed and valued members of society.
Size of Wales, a climate change charity, runs a UN MockCOP event which they run jointly with the Welsh Centre for International Affairs. The project aims to educate the next generation and develop their understanding of international conflict resolution and the political issues surrounding climate change. The MockCOP conference provides a fantastic interactive opportunity for young people aged 14-18 to learn about the UN, the annual climate change talks and develop tolerance and understanding of nations and cultures.
Climate mitigation
The Welsh Government Energy Service has invested over £60 million of zero-interest loans across the public sector in Wales between late 2015 and early 2018 and also supported the delivery of a further £27.5 million of energy and energy efficiency projects, where finance was secured from alternative routes. The carbon savings within the current carbon budget period alone is estimated to be close to 53,000 tonnes. The service is on track to deliver business case targets of 2.5 million tonnes of total carbon dioxide savings from measures installed and will save the public sector over £650 million in avoided energy costs over the life of the assets installed.
Many businesses are already maximising the costsaving opportunities of clean growth. Wales’s 2017 Economic Action Plan (EAP) sets out the range of actions the Welsh Government is taking to drive inclusive growth and prepare for the challenges and opportunities of the future. Decarbonisation is a clear and consistent thread throughout the EAP and features strongly in Wales’s approach for delivering direct support for businesses, including through the Welsh Government’s Economy Futures Fund. To access direct financial support through the Economy Futures Fund, businesses must demonstrate that they share Welsh Government values (the Economic Contract) and that they are delivering investment that is future proofing (the Calls to Action). As part of the Economic Contract, the Welsh Government tests businesses’ attitude to managing and lowering their carbon footprint, whilst decarbonisation forms one of five Calls to Action designed to target future proofing investment.

Northern Ireland
Achieving Green House Gas reductions requires actions to be taken across all Northern Ireland departments. The Northern Ireland Executive established the Cross 
Departmental Working Group on Climate Change 
(CDWGCC) in 2010. The group is chaired by the 
Department for Environment, Agriculture and Rural Affairs Minister and is made up of senior officials from all Northern Ireland government departments.
In Northern Ireland, improvements in energy efficiency, fuel switching and improvements in landfill management (including methane capture and oxidation systems) have driven decreases in greenhouse gas emissions in the energy supply, residential and waste sectors.
The first Northern Ireland Climate Change Adaptation Programme (NICCAP1) was published in January 2014 and provided the Northern Ireland strategic objectives in relation to adaptation to climate change for the period 2014-2019. The second NICCAP contains the Northern Ireland government’s response to the relevant Northern Ireland risks and opportunities. It incorporates lessons learnt and findings of an endof-programme evaluation of NICCAP1. It also takes on board the findings of independent assessments from the Committee on Climate Change and the UK National and the Scottish Climate Change Adaptation Programmes.
Northern Ireland’s Department for Agriculture 
Environment and Rural Affairs supports Climate Northern Ireland (Climate NI). Climate NI is an intersectoral network devoted to increasing understanding of climate change impacts and risks within Northern Ireland and promoting the adaptation actions necessary to address these. It is governed by a Steering Group composed of organisations from government and local authorities, businesses, voluntary communities and academia. It aims to share good practice, increase the understanding of the impacts of climate change in Northern Ireland, share knowledge, promote action and provide independent advice. Climate NI provides a vital link between the voluntary and community sectors, private business sectors, academics and government. 
The National Trust’s ‘Shifting Shores’ programme is providing focus on how coastal change is dealt with as a result of the changing climate and sea level rise. In Northern Ireland, the National Trust is working with partners, government and communities to bring forward long-term planning, knowledge led decision making, government co-ordination, and practical examples of working with nature at the coast. 
UK action around the world 
Climate finance (13.a)
The Data Picture: 2018 UK Climate 
Finance Results 
Coverage: UK
Three UK government departments (Department for International Development, Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) have responsibility for investing in the UK’s International Climate Finance (ICF). Between 2011 and 2018 it is estimated that UK ICF programmes have:

Climate Finance 2018
In the 2015 Paris Agreement, the UK and other developed countries reaffirmed their collective commitment to mobilise US$100 billion of climate finance a year by 2020 from public and private sources to help developing countries mitigate and adapt to climate change. To that end, the UK committed in 2015 to provide at least £5.8 billion of climate finance to developing countries to 2020 and achieved an even split between mitigation and adaptation in 2016 and 2017. This will equate to a doubling of 2014 climate finance in 2020, making the UK one of the largest contributors of climate finance in the world.
The UK uses this climate finance to support developing countries to adapt and be more climate resilient, take up low carbon development and tackle deforestation. The ICF also addresses environmental challenges through the application of nature-based solutions.
Without urgent action, climate impacts could push an additional 100 million people into poverty by 2030. By 2050, it could mean as many as 143 million people will become internal climate migrants.435 Women and girls will be disproportionately affected by the effects of climate change. Under the International Development Act 2014 and in line with the UK Aid Strategy and Paris Agreement, the UK is committed to prioritising the needs of women and girls throughout UK development spending. 

Partnering with multilateral banks is essential to decarbonising the global economy. They play a major role in delivering ‘climate-smart’ development and are contributing a major share of the internationally-agreed target for developed countries to mobilise US$100 billion of climate finance in developing countries per annum by 2020.The UK uses its influence as shareholder of multilateral institutions and climate funds to drive reform and ambition. Since 2008 the Climate Investment Funds have built a portfolio of over 300 investments in 72 developing countries. These have contributed to delivering over 3 gigawatts of new renewable energy capacity.The Green Climate Fund (GCF) is the main dedicated multilateral vehicle for supporting the Paris Agreement. It has funding of US$10.3 billion (initial pledges), of which the UK is contributing £720 million. The GCF uses a range of financial instruments to deliver funding to mitigation and adaptation projects.Raising capacity for effective climate changerelated planning and management (13.b) 
A key objective of UK climate finance is to improve the effectiveness of the international climate finance architecture. This includes building in-country capability and enhancing country ownership for low carbon, climate-resilient development. The UK PACT (Partnerships for Accelerated Climate Transitions) programme is a £60 million fund to build capacity and capability of public, private and civil society institutions to reduce carbon through technical assistance in countries eligible for Official Development Assistance (ODA). 
The UK is working internationally to reduce costs and accelerate the deployment of low carbon technologies. The UK works to strengthen the market for Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) in developing countries, financing the first full-scale power plants in South Africa and Morocco, driving down technology cost for CSP in Morocco by 50%.436

Activity snapshot:
Catholic Relief Services (CRS) leads a consortium of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to scale up resilience for 1 million people in the Niger River Basin, surpassing its target and successfully improving well-being and livelihoods of the most vulnerable populations in Niger and Mali. The programme has updated 19 communal development plans, with integration of the climate change, disaster risk reduction and gender dimension and developed 128 disaster risk reduction community action plans.
The Renewable Energy Performance Platform (REPP) programme works to mobilise private sector development activity in small to medium-sized projects in sub-Saharan Africa. It is supported with £148 million government funding and managed by Camco Clean Energy. To date, REPP has committed US$13.1 million in co-financing for the development of 16 active projects covering a wide range of technologies, from solar homes systems to grid-connected solar farms and run-of-river hydropower plants.437
Global Energy Transfer Feed-in Tariffs Program (GET FiT) supports the development and completion of smallscale on-grid renewable energy projects in Uganda to help avoid an energy shortfall and promote private sector investment. The UK has invested £49.6 million in GET FiT and leveraged €400 million in public and private investment. Plans are underway to see if it could be replicated in 10 neighbouring countries.
The UK is a world leader in providing finance for climate resilience and aims to spend 50% of the ICF on programming to build capacity to anticipate, adapt to and absorb or cope with shocks and stresses related to climate and climate change.
Building Resilience and Adaptation to Climate Extremes and Disasters (BRACED) builds the climate resilience of vulnerable communities across Africa and Asia. Projects range from helping traditional livestock herders mitigate the impact of drought through to helping farmers develop ‘climate-smart’ agricultural production techniques. The programme has already helped over 5 million people.438
The UK’s Hunger Safety Net Programme (HSNP) in Kenya aims to reduce hunger and vulnerability by providing the poorest households in Kenya with regular cash transfers. HSNP reaches over 600,000 people (60% women) with regular, electronic cash transfers of approximately £20 a month, every two months directly into their bank accounts.439 During times of drought, in response to a satellite-based trigger from the national early warning system, it can scale up to cover up to an additional 1.2 million people with emergency electronic cash transfers, directly into their bank accounts. It is quicker, faster and cheaper than humanitarian aid and is now part of Kenya’s National Safety Net Programme to which the Government of Kenya is committing its own resources. 
Activity snapshot:
Over 3 billion people rely on polluting fuels and technologies to meet their daily cooking needs. The University of Liverpool has partnered with research, not-for-profit, private and public sector partners in Ghana, Kenya and Cameroon to deliver CLEAN-Air (Africa). The programme conducts research to reduce mortality/morbidity from exposure to household air pollution by supporting communities from lower- and middle-income countries to transition to clean household energy which also helps reduce solid fuel burning and deforestation.
Partnerships for Forests (P4F) supports public-private partnerships across Africa, South East Asia and Latin America, providing support to develop new sustainable business models, which support development, jobs and livelihoods, without causing deforestation. In Liberia, P4F is Working with the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) to develop ‘rainforestfriendly’ chocolate, providing sustainable livelihoods for poor local communities and helping to protect the Gola Forest. In Ghana P4F works with Touton, a French cocoa trading company, to increase sustainable cocoa production, benefiting up to 150,000 people while protecting the Bia National Park.440
Green finance (13.a)
The majority of financing globally for low carbon and resilient infrastructure will need to come from private sources. Therefore, a policy priority for the UK is to grow and integrate green finance across the finance and professional services sector domestically and overseas through a combination of policy and regulatory action, ODA spending and diplomatic efforts. 
In 2017, the UK government endorsed the Financial 
Stability Board Taskforce on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations and launched 

a UK Green Finance Taskforce to look at actions government and regulators could take to accelerate the growth of green finance, including enhanced disclosures. 
Additionally, the UK government will be investing £20 million in a new clean tech-focussed venture capital Clean Growth Fund and has been working with the private sector and the British Standards Institution to develop a set of voluntary sustainable finance management standards as well as co-chairing an ISO Sustainable Finance Technical Committee. 
The UK has taken a leading role in accelerating the global green finance agenda. For example, seven of the twenty members in the European Commission’s High-Level Expert Group on sustainable finance were from the UK. Furthermore, the UK and China jointly established the G20 Green Finance (renamed Sustainable Finance) Study Group in 2016, and the UK Treasury was a founding member of the Coalition of Finance Ministries for Climate Action. Through its partnerships the UK is also developing green finance markets around the world; providing technical assistance in countries such as China, Mexico and Colombia.
In July 2019, a new Green Finance Institute will be launched with £3.95 million of public and private funding over three years with a mandate to:
• convene and coordinate green finance activity across the UK and between UK and international actors;
• promote the take-up of green finance across the finance sector in order to finance the delivery of UK policy priorities, including the UK government’s 
Clean Growth Strategy and 25 Year Environmental Plan; and
• enhance understanding and engagement with the risks and opportunities of the low carbon transition, and the alignment of financial flows with the Paris Agreement.
In summer 2019, the UK government will publish its Green Finance Strategy which will set out its ambitions accelerate the growth of green finance within the public and private sector across the UK and globally.
International climate initiatives (13.3)
The UK has spearheaded important global initiatives. For example, working with Canada, the UK established the Powering Past Coal Alliance in 2017 – a voluntary coalition of national and sub-national governments, businesses and other organisations committed to ending the use of unabated 441 coal power within a timeframe compatible with the Paris Agreement. Since its launch in November 2017, the Alliance has so far attracted over 80 members, comprising 30 national governments, 22 sub-national governments and 28 businesses or organisations. 
Challenges and next steps
Mitigation and adaptation
Failure to act on climate change will have serious consequences both in the UK and internationally. The impact of climate change is already having a disproportionate impact on the world’s poorest communities. Without concerted global action to limit the extent of climate change and anticipate and manage its impact, there are risks of reversals to global poverty reduction and the drastic loss of biodiversity and healthy ecosystems. The UK will co-lead a Resilience Initiative at the UN Climate Action Summit in September 2019 to raise ambition on climate action globally.
Some 1.3 billion people—about 20% of the global population—rely on forests and forest products for their livelihoods and poorer communities are disproportionately dependent on healthy ecosystems.442 Integrating global efforts on nature and climate change, including through the application of naturebased solutions, can help to realise the contribution of ecosystems to climate mitigation and adaptation. Such approaches can also better support countries in their sustainable management of land and marine resources and associated biodiversity.
UK achievements to date have been substantially driven by significant decarbonisation of the power and waste sectors and this success now needs to be replicated across the economy, particularly in the transport, business and industry sectors which account for almost half of current emissions.
Scotland’s overall contribution to tackling climate change will be based upon a shared understanding between government, society and business of what needs to be done. Whilst Scotland has already made great strides in delivering on Goal 13, delivering the transformative changes that are needed will require a fundamental shift across all sectors of the economy and all parts of society. This offers social and economic opportunities, but it is also important to recognise that there will be risks and challenges to overcome.
The Welsh Government will be publishing its Final Climate Change Adaptation Plan later this year, setting its third carbon budget in 2020 and second Delivery plan around emissions reduction in 2021.
Progress in reducing Northern Ireland’s greenhouse gas emissions requires action to be taken across all Northern Ireland departments. The Committee on Climate Change (CCC), an independent body established under the Climate Change Act 2008, has been commissioned to complete a report on the options, strategies, measures and schemes that can be considered if Northern Ireland is to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions in the 2020s. A comprehensive mid-programme review of NICCAP2 will also be needed.
Investment and innovation
The New Climate Economy, a major international initiative established by the UK and six other countries, produced a report 443 noting the high levels of investment that will be required in coming years to meet climate and development objectives, estimated at around US$90 trillion up to 2030. Much of this will need to come from private sources, and UK financial expertise can play a key role in mobilising this green finance investment need. The UK co-chaired the G20 Green Finance Study Group and placed clean growth at the heart of its Industrial Strategy. In total, the London Stock Exchange in May 2019 had more than 100 green bonds listed, raising over US$26 billion.444
Clean growth also requires breakthroughs in clean technologies. Public sector funding and innovations in universities are crucial to this, but such breakthroughs also need the creativity and energy of the private sector.

Goal 14: Life Below Water
Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources
Summary
The UK’s seas are central to its history, way of life, and economy. The ocean regulates the impacts of climate change, absorbing over a third of carbon dioxide emissions, and is critical in producing oxygen. As an island nation, with the fifth-largest marine estate, the sea connects the UK to the rest of the world. 
Fisheries and marine management is largely devolved. Strong progress on Goal 14 can already be seen across the UK and it has reaffirmed its commitment to the Goal. Good progress has been made on achieving Good Environmental Status in UK seas 445 and more than 50% of UK waters, including Overseas Territories, are set to be in Marine Protected Areas by 2020.446 The UK continues to work with the fishing industry and its world-class marine scientists to make sure more fish stocks are fished at sustainable levels, helping a new generation of fishermen to prosper.
The UK is at the forefront of global efforts to tackle marine plastic and has introduced one of the world’s toughest bans on microbeads. Going forward, the focus is to better understand and address the impacts of climate change on the ocean and to work with others to tackle the main challenges facing the ocean, regionally and globally.
This chapter focusses on how the UK is working to achieve clean, healthy, safe, productive and biologically diverse seas.
Leave No One Behind examples 
• In England, since 2016 the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund has awarded £800,000 each to six Fisheries Local Action Groups (FLAGs) to deliver fisheries-focussed, community-led local development. FLAGs support projects that address local sustainable economic growth, social inclusion and job creation in coastal and inland communities which depend on fishing and aquaculture, and support fishing communities to adapt to the latest fisheries policy. 
• Building on actions taken to tackle ‘period poverty’ the Scottish Government is supporting a project to encourage the use of reusable sanitary products as part of efforts to tackle marine litter.
• The Welsh Government arranged for the alignment of the Community Advice and Listening Line, a mental health helpline for Wales, to send referrals to the Fishermen’s Mission in Wales, helping those facing uncertainty in the fishing industry and providing practical care to fishermen and their families.
• The Northern Ireland Marine Task Force, a coalition of 10 environmental non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in Northern Ireland, campaigns on marine policy issues including marine-protected areas, marine spatial planning and fisheries and has the support of around 100,000 local people.
• The UK co-leads the Commonwealth Clean Ocean Alliance (CCOA) which calls on Commonwealth countries to pledge action on plastics to eliminate avoidable single-use plastic waste. Recognising that plastic pollution cannot be solved by governments alone, it brings together businesses and NGOs to share best practice, leverage funding and encourage global action.

Action in the UK
Marine pollution (14.1)
The UK is determined to reduce marine pollution to levels that do not cause significant harm to the marine environment and has implemented effective measures, including bans or restrictions on use, to manage the input of contaminants and nutrients into the marine environment. The UK has largely achieved Good Environmental Status (GES) for eutrophication (excessive nutrient richness in a body of water exacerbating plant growth) and contaminants, and reduced concentrations of hazardous chemicals.447
The UK is tackling sources of marine litter, including the introduction of one of the world’s toughest bans on microbeads and is working through OSPAR (the Convention for the Protection of the 
Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic), the International Maritime Organization and with other countries to implement marine litter action plans. 
In England, the plastic bag charge (introduced in October 2015) has seen a significant drop in the consumption of single-use carrier bags. The seven key retailers have distributed around 15.6 billion fewer single-use plastic bags since the charge was introduced.448 In 2018, the UK announced that from April 2022 it would introduce a world-leading new tax on the production and import of plastic packaging with less than 30% recycled content, subject to consultation. The UK government has since announced that bans on the distribution and/or sale of plastic straws, stirrers, and plastic stemmed cotton buds will come into force in April 2020.
Activity snapshot:
One of the greatest sources of microplastics is from grey water sources associated with laundry. UK technology company Xeros Technology Group is designing a simple and cost-effective filter capable of removing more than 95% of microfibers, containing microplastics, from laundry effluent. The filter will be compatible with washing machines manufactured anywhere in the world and the company is in discussions with equipment manufacturers to license the technology for inclusion in new machines.
The Data Picture: Hazardous 
Substances 
Coverage: UK
Once released into the environment, hazardous substances can lead to unwanted effects throughout the food chain including predators like seabirds and marine mammals.
This chart shows the combined input of six of the most hazardous substances (cadmium, mercury, copper, lead, zinc and lindane) to the UK marine environment. The combined input has shown a long-term decrease of 80% since 1990, with the latest available data showing that the downward trend has continued in 2016.
Pollution in the marine environment from these six substances should decrease to levels that do not harm sea life by 2020. Concentration of hazardous substances and their biological effects are generally meeting agreed target thresholds. Highly persistent legacy chemicals are the cause of the few failures, mainly in coastal waters close to sources of pollution.

Protection and sustainable management of the marine environment (14.2, 14.5)
The UK is a global leader on the implementation of marine planning and the regulation of activities in the marine area. The UK Marine Strategy Programme of Measures, its marine plans, marine licensing regime and the implementation of management measures in the UK’s extensive network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are all contributing to Global Target 14.2. MPAs are areas of the ocean where human activity is managed for conservation purposes.
In 2019 there were 355 MPAs in UK waters, over half of all MPAs within the north east Atlantic network. With those designated in 2019,449 they now cover 25% of the UK’s domestic waters, more than double the 10% target (14.5).450 All sites are protected through the licensing and planning process from the point they are consulted on, and fisheries management measures have been or will be developed for each of the sites.
The UK’s marine plans give regulators and marine users a framework to make decisions. The UK’s marine plans support sustainable development of the marine area, whilst protecting the environment and ensure coastal communities and the wider public benefit from clean, healthy, safe, productive, and biologically-diverse seas.
The £20 million Blue Belt Programme is on track to protect over four million km² of marine environment across UK Overseas Territories by 2020. Providing access to technical expertise, practical surveillance and technological solutions it ensures all MPAs are based on robust data, legislation and enforcement. It is trialling the use of satellite surveillance, combining data from multiple sources to identify vessels acting suspiciously, and tackling Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing particularly in remote places lacking the capability to effectively patrol waters with ships or planes. In 2016, MPAs were established around the Pitcairn Islands (834,000 km2) and St Helena 
(446,000 km²).451
The Data Picture: Coverage of protected areas in relation to marine areas (14.5.1). 
Coverage: UK
The extent of protected areas across the UK increased ten-fold between 2007 and 2017, from 2.0% in 2007 to 23.8% in 2018. The main increase was in 2014 when 6 million hectares were designated as Marine Conservation Zones in English, Welsh, and Northern Irish waters, and as Nature Conservation Marine Protected Areas in Scottish waters.

Ocean acidification (14.3, 14.a)
A global leader on ocean acidifications science, the UK is committed to increasing cooperation including through global networks that stretch into the waters around the Arctic that are particularly susceptible to acidification. In 2017 the UK published a synopsis of its 6-year ocean acidification research programme which identified the impact of ocean acidification as a multiple stressor. Working with OSPAR, Commonwealth partners and the Global Ocean Acidification Observing Network (GOA-ON), the UK takes a leading role coordinating and improving monitoring efforts at a national, regional and global level. Through GOA-ON, the North East Atlantic Ocean Acidification Hub was established in the UK (2018). It will act as the European regional centre on monitoring and research, primarily within the North East Atlantic region, complementing regional hubs around the world.
Sustainable fisheries (14.4, 14.6)
The UK has made significant progress in introducing sustainable fisheries measures, including landing obligations, gear subsidies and incentives, accreditation schemes, and area-based management measures. UK fish stocks now show signs of recovery following historic over-exploitation.452
The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea applies the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) approach (maximising the average long-term yield from sustainable stocks) to produce advice and assessments for fish stocks. Efforts to increase data collection and follow scientific advice have paid off: the number of stocks fished in line with MSY, and the overall number of stocks with enough data collection to go through MSY assessments, has increased significantly in the past thirty years. The percentage of fish stocks that the UK has a direct interest in (including Nephrops), fished at or below levels capable of producing MSY has much improved from 12% (1990) to 53% (2015).453
All quotas are now set based on catches rather than landings in line with the landing obligation, whereby all quota species must be landed and counted against quota unless specific exemptions apply. Phased in since 2015, it was fully implemented from 1 January 2019.
The UK is committed to ending the wasteful practice of discarding fish. It is working with the fishing industry, environmental NGOs and other EU Member States to continue adjusting fishing practices to avoid unwanted catches of bycatch species from economically important mixed fisheries while developing and implementing management approaches to further increase selectivity through technical and spatial measures. 
The Data Picture: Degree of (a) implementation of international instruments aiming to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU) (14.6.1) and (b) application of a legal/ regulatory/ policy/ institutional framework which recognises and protects access rights for small-scale fisheries (14.b.1).
The scores are based on the UK’s response to the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries questionnaire (2018) covering: (a) the degree of adherence with and implementation of the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), 1995 UN Fish Stocks Agreement, 2009 FAO agreement on Port State measures, development and implementation of a national action plan to combat IUU fishing and the implementation of Flag State Responsibilities; and (b) existence of laws, regulations, policies, plans or strategies that target or address small scale fisheries (SSF); initiatives to implement the SSF guidelines; mechanisms through which small scale fishers and fish workers can contribute to decision making processes. 
The UK scores are in the same bands as the Europe regional grouping in 2018.

Scotland
Scotland is a maritime nation with a sea area that is six times bigger than the land mass and a coastline that stretches over 18,000 km.454 41% of Scotland’s population live within five kilometres of the coast455 and marine industries directly contribute at least £3.8 billion gross value added (GVA) to the economy annually.456
In 2020 Scotland will celebrating a year of Coast and Waters. Scotland has some of the most beautiful and diverse marine ecosystems in the world and it is committed to protecting and enhancing these amazing ecosystems to ensure they are safeguarded for future generations to enjoy. Scotland’s vision is for clean, healthy, safe, productive and diverse seas that are managed to meet the long-term needs of nature and people.
Marine environment (14.1, 14.2, 14.4)
The marine environment in Scotland is covered by two key acts, “the Marine Acts”: the Marine (Scotland) Act 2010 which covers its inshore waters, and the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 (MACA) which covers the offshore waters. The Marine Acts support better management of the competing demands on marine resources. Using powers in the Marine Acts, the National Marine Plan (2015) was adopted to ensure increasing demands for the use of Scotland’s marine environment are managed, economic development of marine industries is encouraged, and environmental protection is incorporated into decision-making. 
The Data Picture: Clean seas
Coverage: Scotland
Global Target 14.1 aims to prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, in particular from land-based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution. 
In Scotland, the concentrations of metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in biota (fish and shellfish) and sediment are at acceptable levels in 82.5% of contaminant assessments.

 	Performance Framework
Scotland’s Marine Atlas, published in 2011, provides information for the National Marine Plan and an assessment of the condition of Scotland’s seas. It is based on scientific evidence from data and analysis, supported by expert judgement. A new assessment of Scotland’s seas is due for publication in 2020. 
The Marine Strategy Regulations 2010 apply in all of Scotland’s seas and provide a framework for management, monitoring, and assessment of the environmental status. This involves managing human activities to ensure the marine environment remains in a healthy state that can provide ecosystem services to current and future generations. 
Activity snapshot: 
SCRAPbook (Scottish Coastal Rubbish Aerial 
Photography) is an initiative, led by the Moray Firth Partnership and UK Civil Air Patrol (Sky Watch), using aerial photographs taken from a light aircraft, to create a map showing coastal litter and pollution hotspots around the coast of Scotland. Throughout 2018, images were captured covering the mainland coast and classified by a team of volunteers according to how much litter was visible. For the first time, these data provide a spatially comprehensive overview of where litter is accumulating on the mainland coast, the initial step towards understanding the distribution of marine litter sinks around the country. The map is now informing targeted cleaning operations to clean up Scotland’s coastline.
Sustainable fisheries (14.4, 14.6)
The Scottish Government has launched a dialogue with key stakeholders on the future management of Scottish sea fisheries. Marine Scotland has initiated an in-depth consultation through the Scottish Sea Fisheries National Discussion Paper to develop Scotland’s future approach in partnership with stakeholders.457
Scotland is working towards achieving MSY for all stocks, though there are significant challenges in achieving this in a mixed fishery. 
Management, protection and conservation of marine ecosystems (14.2, 14.5)
Scotland’s National Marine Plan and Marine Licensing ensures sustainable development in the marine environment. Specific action is taken to develop and manage the MPA network and put in place measures and strategies to protect specific species. Protected areas are used to ensure protection of some of the most vulnerable species and habitats. The Scottish MPA network includes sites for nature conservation, protection of biodiversity, demonstrating sustainable management, and protecting Scottish heritage. In total, the network covers approximately 22% of Scottish seas and as a whole is representative of the range of biodiversity and geodiversity found in Scotland’s seas.458
The Data Picture: Sustainability of fish stocks
Coverage: Scotland
Global Target 14.4 (Global Indicator 14.4.1) aims to effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices and implement science-based management plans, in order to restore fish stocks in the shortest time feasible, at least to levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield as determined by their biological characteristics.
In Scotland, the proportion of key commercial Scottish fish stocks where fishing mortality is below sustainability thresholds was 54% in 2018.

Wales
Prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution (14.1) 
Wales aims to make a leading contribution to the UN Clean Seas campaign. In 2017, it brought together a diverse range of conservation organisations and NGOs, such as Keep Wales Tidy and the Marine Conservation Society, to form the Clean Seas Partnership, which worked together to develop Wales’s first Marine Litter Action Plan. The Plan has been designed with prevention, collaboration and long-term solutions as its core principles and it sets out positive actions to help reduce and prevent litter from entering the marine environment and will support the achievement of GES. 
Activity snapshot:
The marine area was a key theme in Wales in 2018 with “Year of the Sea” as the national theme for tourism, the 30th anniversary of the Blue Flag Award in Wales, the 25th Anniversary of the Marine Conservation Society Beach Cleanup and Cardiff’s hosting of the Volvo Ocean Race which drew attention to marine pollution. 
Manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems (14.2, 14.5) 
Wales’s marine and coastal environment supports social, business and conservation interests, from the UK’s only coastal National Park in Pembrokeshire, the UK’s first coastal Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (Gower), to the world renowned Menai Strait in North Wales which is home to Halen Mon Anglesey Sea Salt. It is therefore vital it remains protected and well-managed.
Working with Welsh and other UK stakeholders, Wales is currently developing strategic planning policies in the first ever Wales National Marine Plan covering the inshore and offshore areas. Taking a 20-year view, it provides guidance for all decisions which affect the marine area. It aims to manage increasing demands for the use of the marine environment; support the sustainable economic development of marine sectors; and incorporate environmental protection and social considerations into decision-making. As such, it supports coastal communities at the local level and drives national economic growth in a sustainable way. 
The Environment (Wales) Act 2016 and the Sustainable 
Management of Natural Resources policy reflects Wales’s commitment to the management of natural resources in a proactive, sustainable and joined-up way. Such ways of working are aligned with achieving the Well-being of Future Generations Act (Wales) 2015 goals and objectives.
Wales is committed to achieving and maintaining GES, in line with the UK Marine Strategy. The UK Marine Strategy sets out how Wales will achieve or maintain GES on a six-year cycle. It outlines key strategic targets and, more specifically, its ambitions for delivering GES in Wales, which are set out in the programme of measures. By taking these actions, the Welsh marine environment will continue to remain productive and resilient for future generations. To better understand the health, condition and resilience of its seas, Wales is also working with partners to develop a prioritised and affordable marine biodiversity monitoring programme.
Sustainable fisheries (14.4) 
A commitment to marine ecosystem resilience will be a key consideration in shaping future fisheries management policy for Wales, creating a framework which protects and secures benefits from sustainably managed fish stocks. 
Wales intends to improve long-term sustainable fishing measures by: reducing sector fragmentation; giving fishers greater management responsibility over the coastal environment; and improving sector organisation and representation. The Welsh Government is developing a Fisheries Evidence Plan with work underway to assess the current state of the scientific knowledge for Wales’s most important commercial species and stocks. 
The biological, ecological and fisheries data gaps identified through this plan will be addressed through surveys, assessments and analysis. The Welsh Government is working with the fishing industry to explore these issues in more detail and will review what initiatives are put in place to deliver long-term sustainable fishing that does not negatively affect the marine environment. 
Although the emergence of new unfished areas is unlikely due to Wales’s long history of fishing, it is possible through natural circumstances or climate change that new stocks may become abundant in coming years. Planning will focus on improving the economic strength of the Welsh fishing industry, the long-term sustainability of key shellfish stocks and, over time through the negotiation of a greater share of stocks, diversification into other established species. 
Conserve at least 10% of coastal and marine areas (14.5) 
There are 139 Marine Protected Areas (MPA) in Wales 459, covering 69% of Welsh inshore waters and 50% of all Welsh waters, far exceeding the 10% target. Given the extensive coverage, Wales is committed to delivering a well-managed network of MPAs and is focussed on maintaining and improving the condition of the network. To enable this, MPA management is steered by an agreed long-term vision and objectives under the ‘Marine Protected Area Network Management Framework for Wales 2018-2023’. Coupled with this, annual Action Plans provide strategic, prioritised actions for delivery by management authorities with statutory responsibilities in relation to MPAs. Wales’s MPAs make a significant contribution towards an ecologically coherent UK network of MPAs. Wales has recently established a Task and Finish Group to identify potential Marine Conservation Zones in the Welsh inshore and offshore areas, that can address a small number of gaps in ecological coherence within the network. It will continue to fulfil this commitment by using the combination of powers available through the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 and the various Regulations implementing the Birds and Habitats Directive.
Activity snapshot:
The Angel Shark Project Wales is gathering data to better understand the status and ecology of the Critically Endangered Angelshark, once common in Welsh waters and across the western British Isles. ‘Dive for Angels’ surveys will use citizen science divers and snorkelers to collect data in key areas. Collaboration with fishers and public outreach will encourage sightings reporting and guidance for fishers to safely release these protected species if accidentally caught, will help better understand how many Angelsharks use Welsh waters and where they are found. The ‘History of Angels’ research project will gather and capture Wales’s rich maritime heritage and connection to one of the world’s rarest sharks.
Northern Ireland 
Marine litter (14.1)
Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), which consists of nitrate, nitrite and ammonia is an important indicator of marine nutrient status, as nitrogen is the most important nutrient in limiting marine algal growth. Excessive levels of marine nutrients can lead to local imbalances of marine phytoplankton (planktonic blooms) and macroalgae (seaweeds), a process known as eutrophication. By impacting the dissolved oxygen concentrations of the water column, it can lead to fish kills and the localised smothering of other marine macroalgae and animals, particularly in intertidal areas.
In Northern Ireland, levels of winter DIN have been monitored consistently at 24 marine water bodies since 2012. The levels remained relatively stable between 2012 and 2016. In 2017, winter DIN fell to a low of 20.82µM (micrograms), showing a potential 5.6 µM decrease on the 2015 baseline year.460 This is encouraging; however, many years of data are required to assess whether this is a positive trend. Northern Ireland will continue to implement measures in the second cycle ‘River Basin Management Plans’ and support other programmes and strategies aimed at improving water quality. 
Activity snapshot:
Keep Northern Ireland Beautiful is an environmental charity committed to making Northern Ireland a cleaner, more pleasant place to live. Its projects, including Single Use Plastic Prevention Programme, Eco-Schools new Marine Topic and Young Reporters for the Environment, help to conserve and encourage sustainable use of the oceans, seas and marine resources and aim to prevent marine pollution and protect marine and coastal eco-systems.
Activity snapshot:Ulster Wildlife delivers the Sea Deep project, a conservation initiative focussed on endangered sharks, skates and rays around Northern Ireland. From tagging sharks at sea to surveying for their egg cases on the shore, Sea Deep is training and equipping volunteers to collect much-needed data on local species to inform conservation and management measures.UK action around the world 
The UK government supports several international initiatives and programmes that help deliver Goal 14, and it has reaffirmed its commitment to the Goal, including in the UK government’s 25 Year Environment Plan.
The Commonwealth Blue Charter (14.2, 14.3, 14.5)
Agreed in 2018, the Blue Charter is a commitment by all Commonwealth countries to work together on ocean issues and sustainable ocean development. Nine Blue Charter Action Groups have been established to deliver its ambition, of which the UK has joined five: coral reef restoration; mangroves; MPAs; ocean acidification; and ocean and climate change.
The Commonwealth Clean Ocean Alliance (14.1)
Alongside Vanuatu, the UK co-leads the 
Commonwealth Clean Ocean Alliance (CCOA), a Blue Charter Action Group. Recognising that plastic pollution cannot be solved by governments alone, the CCOA brings together businesses and NGOs to share best practice, leverage funding and encourage global action. It calls on Commonwealth countries to pledge action on plastics, be this by a ban on microbeads, a commitment to cutting down single-use plastic bags, or other steps to eliminate avoidable plastic waste.
To help deliver this, the UK committed up to up to £70 million million between 2018-22 to drive research and innovation, develop sustainable manufacturing, and support developing countries to stop plastic from entering the ocean in the first place. This includes: up to £10 million of technical assistance for CCOA members, a £25 million Commonwealth Marine Plastics Research and Innovation Framework; up to £6 million to fund urban waste management pilot projects until 2021; £6 million for the Commonwealth Marine Litter Programme, which supports ODA-eligible Commonwealth countries to develop national marine litter plans; and £2.4 million of investment for the Global Plastic Action Partnership, hosted by the World Economic Forum, bringing businesses, international donors, governments, community groups and experts together to tackle plastic pollution.
Activity snapshot:
Through the CCOA, the UK is partnering with UK Scouts to inspire and empower young people to tackle plastic pollution. A new Plastics and Marine Environment Activity Pack has been created and distributed across the UK to help reduce the amount of single-use plastics in the ocean. This will be supported by the Plastic Tide Turners Challenge Badge in partnership with UN Environment, working with young people across the Commonwealth to raise awareness of marine plastic pollution and support them in becoming leaders and advocates for behaviour change among their peers.
Blue Ventures Carbon Project (14.2, 14.b)
Through the UK’s International Climate Fund (ICF) over £10 million has been committed between 201623 to design and introduce a model of sustainable development for mangrove habitats. The project will reduce mangrove deforestation, create sustainable livelihoods, and increase climate resilience in poor coastal communities. It will support community health and women’s empowerment by providing training and access to family planning services. Highlights from the first two years include over 6,000 hectares of mangrove forest protected or under sustainable local management and over 500 people trained and supported through alternative livelihoods such as beekeeping and cucumber farming.461 UK Blue Carbon Fund (14.2, 14.7, 14.b)
In 2018, £12.75 million of ICF funding was committed to support sustainable mangrove projects in Latin American and the Caribbean.462 The fund will mobilise public and private sector investment to support projects in the blue carbon sector, including sustainable fisheries and eco-tourism, alongside restoring or protecting up to 6,000 hectares of mangroves.
Commonwealth Marine Economies Programme 
(14.1, 14.2, 14.3, 14.4, 14.5, 14.7, 14.a, 14.b, 14.c)
This programme supports 17 Small Island Developing States (SIDS) in identifying the potential of, and developing, their marine economies in a sustainable, resilient and integrated way. It promotes growth, innovation, jobs and investment whilst safeguarding healthy seas and ecosystems. Working with SIDS governments, it supports the development and implementation of national Maritime Economy Plans. It will maximise and protect livelihood opportunities for the poorest, reduce gender inequality and engage youth through education and training initiatives as part of the knowledge exchange activities (see Goal 5).
Achievements since launching include: priority clean-up activities and coastal planning in the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu by identifying marine litter and pollution hotspots (Global Target 14.1); and development of sustainable tourism in Fiji (Global Target 14.7).463
Challenges and next steps
The ocean does not respect regional or international boundaries. Working together, across the devolved administrations, the Overseas Territories and with global partners is key to ensure progress continues beyond 2030. Marine pollution
Marine litter, particularly plastic, remains a key challenge domestically and globally; and is expected to increase further. It is apparent on UK beaches, in the water column and on the seafloor. OSPAR’s first assessment of seabed litter showed plastics to be widespread on the seafloor. It will take time and effort to address this, requiring behavioural changes from households, businesses and throughout supply chains.
The 2017 OSPAR Intermediate Assessment, which included the status of marine pollution in UK waters and wider North-East Atlantic, showed that since 2010 contaminant concentrations have decreased in the majority of areas assessed, especially man-made chemicals like PCBs.464 Although concentrations are generally below levels likely to harm marine species in the areas assessed, they mostly have not yet returned to background levels. Concerns remain in some localised areas with respect to high levels of mercury, lead, and CB118 (one of the most toxic polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) congeners) and locally increasing concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and cadmium in open waters. 
To help tackle marine pollution, in May 2019 England confirmed a ban on plastic straws, drinks stirrers, and plastic-stemmed cotton buds will come into force in April 2020. Scotland is also working to reduce the input of litter into the marine environment by banning the manufacture and sale of plastic-stemmed cotton buds, and actions to follow the guidelines in the European Strategy for Plastics (applicable UK-wide).
In Northern Ireland, data (from 2017) shows soluble reactive phosphorus in rivers is rising again with a negative impact on river water quality.465 While the increase is marginal, it is concerning that there are early signs of an upward trend despite the measures deployed to reduce pollution from agricultural sources. It is likely that pressures will have increased in 2018 due to an increase in the use of concentrate feeds following low grass yields (see Goal 12.)
Sustainable fishing
While UK fish stocks show signs of recovery from over-exploitation, recovery of fish populations has not been consistent across all UK regional seas. The UK is committed to ensuring that all fish stocks are recovered to and maintained at sustainable levels, will continue to apply the MSY when setting or agreeing total allowable catches, and will promote fishing within MSY ranges in line with international scientific advice on mixed fisheries.466 The UK will work closely with neighbours to ensure the sustainable management of shared stocks.
The UK will take advantage of the opportunities offered by leaving the EU to bring in a world-class fisheries management system based on the principle of MSY and an ecosystem approach to fisheries management to restore and protect the marine ecosystem. The Fisheries Bill 467 will provide the legal framework for the UK to operate as an independent coastal state under UNCLOS after exiting the EU and the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). It will restate the UK’s commitment to sustainable fisheries, including on MSY. After leaving the EU and the CFP, the UK will publish an annual assessment of the state of stocks of interest to the UK. If particular stocks struggle to recover and fall below safe biological limits, the UK will work with all interested parties to implement recovery plans, ensuring they are restored to a healthy condition. 
In March 2019, Scotland launched a national discussion paper on the future of fisheries management and Northern Ireland continues to develop long-term management plans for fisheries in the Irish Sea by working with the UK Fisheries Administrations and the Commission, through CFP reform and Marine Strategy Framework Directive. This will help ensure more stocks are fished at MSY each year, with the aim to get all stocks there by 2020.
The UK remains committed to the World Trade Organization (WTO) ambition to end fisheries subsidies that contribute to overcapacity, overfishing, and illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing.
MPAs and marine plans
While significant progress has been made against the 10% MPA target, continued management is necessary to ensure objectives are met and to ensure compliance with measures in place for the protection of habitats and species. Work to fully implement MPA management measures and monitor effectiveness is ongoing. Moving away from the Common Fisheries Policy to UK legislation when managing offshore MPAs will enable more reactive action and faster mitigation of risks.
The UK will move to a whole-site approach to protect sites of greatest biodiversity interest. Future management will adapt to changing pressures placed on the marine environment, including climate change. Work on the MPA network in Scotland will focus on completing the network and implementing management measures. Alongside this, monitoring and assessment of what the network is achieving for biodiversity will continue.
The UK will also ensure marine plans are in place for the whole of the UK marine area by March 2021 and will continue to implement a marine licensing regime that supports sustainable development and environmental protection (Global Target 14.2). Wales is currently developing the Wales National Marine Plan which takes a 20-year view on how to increase the sustainable use of its seas.
Global ocean issues
The UK is participating in international negotiations to develop an international agreement under UNCLOS to conserve and sustainably manage biodiversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction, and regulations to manage the sustainable exploitation of seabed mineral resources. 
At the upcoming Convention on Biological Diversity Conference of the Parties in 2020, the UK is looking to agree to triple the current Global Target for MPA protection, so that 30% of the global ocean is within MPAs by 2030.
It is also creating an International Ocean Strategy which will guide its international work to deliver Goal 14.  It will explain that through effective conservation and sustainable management and the development of clean technologies and sustainable marine industries, everyone can sustain the ocean’s life-support role and support the blue economy while meeting the Goals  by 2030. 

Goal 15: Life on Land
Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss.
Summary
The natural environment is fundamental to a community’s quality of life; it filters the air people breathe, regulates the climate and is a place for public enjoyment. Better protection of ecosystems, improved management of protected sites, incentives for farming and woodland management, and funding for peatland restoration have all borne results in the UK. In recent years, there have also been a number of species conservation successes. 
However, much work remains. The extent and condition of the UK’s land-based ecosystems, including forests, remain affected by past changes in land use, and by pollution, invasive non-native species and climate change. Whilst long-term declines in the number and distribution of certain species have slowed in some cases, continued action is needed to tackle ongoing declines across many groups. 
The UK is also committed to leading international action to protect biodiversity. The UK continues to champion efforts to address global degradation and loss, investing in conservation and coordinating action in the fight against illegal wildlife trade, including introducing one of the world’s toughest bans on ivory sales. 
This chapter summarises the progress made and challenges faced in supporting vital terrestrial habitats and species, both domestically and internationally.
Leave No One Behind examples:
• 2019 is the Year of Green Action, a year-long drive to help individuals, community groups, conservationists, business and industry across England to get involved in projects that support nature – in gardens, schools or workplaces, and as consumers.
• The Green Infrastructure Fund supports projects in some of Scotland’s most deprived urban communities to make best use of their local environment, help tackle effects of climate change, attract business and boost job opportunities.
• Over £300,000 is being invested in a new forestry apprenticeship pilot in Wales. Forests and woodlands provide a range of career opportunities which require highly specialised skills such as tree felling, pruning, coppicing, wood chipping and re-planting. The two-year pilot is key to the delivery of the Employability Plan and is designed to fulfil the skills and recruitment needs identified by the forestry sector supporting up to 30 new forestry jobs and encouraging and supporting farm diversification.
• In Northern Ireland, Business in the Community Northern Ireland together with Ulster Wildlife delivers the Business & Biodiversity Charter which provides a framework for businesses to implement measures to reduce their impacts on biodiversity and contribute to the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of ecosystems and their services.
• The UK’s Darwin Initiative funds projects protecting biodiversity in developing countries. Its priority is to secure benefits for poorer, more vulnerable communities. For example, in Papua New Guinea, funding has been provided since 2001 to train indigenous people so that they can work with scientists to protect rainforests threatened by industrial logging.

Action in the UK
Frameworks for conserving ecosystems and species (15.1, 15.2, 15.4, 15.5)
Significant progress has been made with protecting and managing ecosystems, and widespread habitat losses in the last century have slowed. The extent of UK protected areas on land has increased by 12,900 hectares (2013) to 6.84 million hectares (2018), and site condition has improved.468
The Data Picture: Sites of Special Scientific Interest 
Coverage: England, Scotland and Northern Ireland
The percentage of features, or area, of ‘Areas or Sites of Special Scientific Interest’ (A/SSSIs) in favourable or recovering condition increased from 67% in 2005, to 86% in 2015, and remained stable at 85% in 2018.
Protected sites are surveyed periodically and are considered favourable when the conditions on the site are suitable for the species and other features for which it is designated.

(JNCC), UK Biodiversity Indicators 2018
Many species have seen long-term declines in abundance and distribution, particularly during the 1970s and 1980s. Against this backdrop, some species like cirl bunting, red kite and some species of bats are showing signs of recovery.469
Global Targets for Goal 15 are closely aligned with the ‘Aichi’ targets under the Convention on Biological Diversity’s (CBD) global action plan. The Aichi targets are a mixture of outcome and process targets covering the status of biodiversity and actions taken to conserve it. As part of its commitment to the CBD, in 2019 the UK published an assessment of progress against these targets.470 Across the 20 Aichi targets: five are assessed as on track to achieve the target, including: integration of biodiversity into planning and development of national accounting; extent of protected areas; and increasing the scientific base and knowledge transfer related to biodiversity. 14 are assessed as progressing but at an insufficient rate to meet the target, including rate of loss, degradation and fragmentation of natural habitats; conservation of threatened species; and addressing priority invasive species; and one had no assessment made as the target is not relevant to the UK.
Alongside the Global Indicators, the UK has developed more detailed UK indicators471 to report progress towards the Aichi targets (2011-20). For example, an indicator of pollinator distribution has been developed which can assess progress with halting biodiversity loss (see data box). In England, a new set of metrics is being developed to measure progress towards the UK government’s 25 Year Environment Plan (see Goals 3, 12, 13, 14, and 17). 
Activity snapshot:
Groups of farming and landowning organisations, NGOs, researchers and agencies oversee delivery of England’s biodiversity and pollinator strategies.
Natural England leads the implementation of the biodiversity strategy, protected sites and peatland programmes, with other agencies like the Environment Agency, Forestry Commission and Joint Nature Conservation Committee playing strong roles on site improvement work and monitoring and surveillance.
Increasingly, the UK works with external funders and conservation organisations to deliver ecosystem and species conservation projects. For example, working to recover over 200 threatened species on the Back from the Brink programme.
The Data Picture: Pollinator distribution 
Coverage: Great Britain
Species loss is a key concern in the UK (Global Target 15.5). The indicator of the status of pollinating insects shows that overall distribution has declined since 1980 but has been relatively stable overall since 2011 although some individual species are still declining. 
The indicator shows the average change in distribution for 351 insect species in Britain. As a greater proportion of species become less widespread, the indicator declines. Trends are different for different species groups. For wild bees, the indicator remains generally stable between 1980 and 2006, then declines sharply before recovering since 2013. For hoverflies it shows steady decline since 1980.

Activity snapshot:
A pollinator monitoring and research partnership was set up in 2016 between government, research institutes and nongovernmental organisations (NGOs). The partnership’s UK Pollinator Monitoring Scheme (PoMS) is the only scheme in the world generating systematic data on the abundance of bees, hoverflies and other flower-visiting insects at a national scale, currently across England, Wales and Scotland. This data improves understanding of the status of UK pollinators and pollination services and helps everyone to play a part in conservation.
Non-native species (pests and disease) (15.8)
Invasive non-native species (INNS) are key drivers of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation. The GB Invasive Non-Native Species Strategy sets out actions to introduce measures to prevent the introduction, and significantly reduce the impact of INNS on land and water and control or eradicate priority invasive species. It follows internationally-recognised principles of prevention, rapid eradication and management. 
The first GB pathway action plan for zoos was published in 2016 to raise awareness and strengthen management of INNS introduction pathways. Contingency plans have been drafted for terrestrial, freshwater and marine species. Two amphibians and two fish species have been eradicated, with more national-scale eradications ongoing including Ruddy duck, Monk parakeet, Water primrose and Topmouth gudgeon.
The UK secured £2.75 million funding during 2016-
20 for two projects to support the 16 UK Overseas Territories from the threat from INNS. The first develops comprehensive biosecurity for the Overseas Territories by providing them with access to UK government expertise. The second contributes to the RSPB-led eradication of mice from Gough Island in the South Atlantic. Each year, mice kill over a million seabird chicks and are the main threat to the endangered Tristan albatross and Gough Island bunting.472
Tree pests and diseases also accelerate biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation. England’s Tree Health Resilience Strategy includes a proactive approach to biosecurity, with landowners, charities, the public and government working together to build resilience against pests and diseases.
Britain has more ancient oak trees than the rest of Europe combined,473 with over 2000 other species dependent on it,474 but they face threats from climate change, pests and diseases. Action Oak, launched in 2018, is a partnership charity aiming to raise funds to combat these threats (see Goal 17).
Woodland and land management (15.1, 15.2; 15.4, 
15.5, 15.a, 15) 
To protect the economic, social and environmental benefits from woodland creation and management, the UK government is ensuring: public forests and woodlands are kept in trust for the nation; stronger protection for ancient woodland; and a duty on local authorities to consult before felling street trees. 
UK woodland extent has risen slowly from 12.4% (2004) to 13.1% (2018) of total land area (3.17 million hectares in 2018).475
In England, £2.9 billion is being spent on agrienvironment schemes through the 7-year Rural Development Programme, to support land management and rural development; and over £50 million annually to manage over 1 million hectares of protected sites. In total, Natural England estimates that management is in place to create an additional 130,000 hectares of wildlife-rich habitat outside protected sites (2011-18).476
Countryside Stewardship (and existing agreements under Environment Stewardship) financially incentivises farmers and land managers in England to protect the natural environment by: conserving and restoring habitats; managing flood risk and reducing water pollution; creating and managing woodland preserving historical features; and encouraging educational access (see Goals 6, 11, 12, and 13). 

Peatland (15.1, 15.3) 
The UK government’s 25 Year Environment Plan will deliver a new framework for peat restoration in England. In April 2018, £10 million was allocated to four large-scale peatland restoration projects across England, supporting the restoration of 6,580 hectares of diverse upland and lowland peatlands (see Goal 13). Planning policy (15.1, 15.5, 15.9)
The National Planning Policy Framework for England was updated (July 2018), to clarify that development should provide net gains for biodiversity and to strengthen protection for irreplaceable habitats like ancient woodland. 
Net gain is an approach to development aiming to leave the natural environment in a measurably better state than beforehand. Across England, there has been voluntary adoption of net gain approaches. England has committed to mandating ‘biodiversity net gain’ for development, including housing and infrastructure, and is implementing an innovative approach to protecting great crested newts in the planning and development process (see Goals 9, 11, and 13).
Flood Management (15.1)
In England, £2.6 billion is being invested in the flood protection capital programme (2015-21) delivering more than 1,500 projects to better protect 300,000 homes.477 A further £1 billion is being invested to maintain existing defence schemes. Natural Flood Management measures are included in many of these schemes and play a key role in the flood risk reduction strategy. To demonstrate these benefits, the UK has invested: £4.1 million in three projects (2009-15); and £15 million on 26 large catchment scale projects and 34 community projects (2017) (see Goals 9, 11, and 13).
Activity snapshot:
Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew’s UK National Tree Seed Project collects and stores seed from native trees and shrubs throughout the UK, to conserve the genetic diversity of UK trees and woodlands, and to develop genetically representative collections in the Millennium Seed Bank (MSB). Already over 12.5 million seeds have been successfully stored, from over 8,000 trees across the UK. High quality seed collections stored in the MSB can be kept alive for many decades. This means that seeds collected as part of this project will be a resource for future generations. The collections and associated data are made available for research and conservation. A study of its collections of ash trees suggests that over 90% of the UK genetic diversity of this species has been conserved by the project. 
Scotland
Scotland has a range of laws and plans in place relating to this Goal including on land use and forestry. The level of ambition in the targets and global challenge of biodiversity loss is recognised. Scottish Planning Policy sets out that planning should seek benefits for biodiversity from new development where possible, including the restoration of degraded habitats and the avoidance of further fragmentation or isolation of habitats.
Forestry (15.1 and 15.2)
In 2018, Scotland’s woodland area covered 18.5%478 of its total land area with targets to increase this to 21% by 2032.479 In Scotland, the commitment to manage these woodlands according to the international principles of sustainable forest management (SFM) has been formalised under the Forestry and Land Management (Scotland) Act 2018, which places a duty on Scottish Ministers and Scottish public authorities to promote SFM. 
58% of Scotland’s woodlands have been independently certified 480 as being sustainably managed, and the woodland area is expanding. In 2017/18, 7,200 hectares of new woodland was created,481 and over 3,000 hectares of native woodland established. 68.1% of native woodland features in protected areas were in good condition.482
Scotland’s Forestry Strategy 2019-2029 sets out a 10year framework for action, including activities to ensure woodlands are sustainably managed, expanded, and the environmental benefits they provide enhanced.483
Biodiversity (15.5, 15.9)
Progress on halting biodiversity loss will be measured in great part by Scotland’s success or failure in meeting a key set of targets: the Aichi targets as part of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020. This is a ten-year framework for action by all countries and stakeholders to save biodiversity and enhance its benefits for people. This and the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation targets are both part of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). Scotland, like many other countries, is facing the challenge of declining biodiversity and is currently reporting a mix of successes and challenges.
Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) reported that seven Aichi targets are assessed as being on track; 12 are showing progress but requiring additional action if Scotland is to meet these targets by 2020; and only one of the 20 targets, related to funding, is moving away from target.484
Other data on biodiversity show a more granular picture. The Scottish Biodiversity Strategy: Report to the Scottish Parliament 2014-2016 (2017), contains a summary of Biodiversity State Indicators. Of the current indicators in the report, three (abundance of terrestrial breeding birds; notified species in favourable condition; notified habitats in favourable condition) were considered to be improving, three (wintering waterbirds; breeding seabirds; butterflies - specialists) were worsening, and one was stable (butterflies - generalists).485 A subsequent report has found that specialist butterflies long-term trends are stable compared to when records began in 1979.486
According to the 2016 State of Nature Report, Scotland’s current biodiversity health status suggests that “ecosystems may have fallen below the point at which they can reliably meet society’s needs”. The same report highlights that 520 Scottish species are at risk of extinction in Britain, due to pressures such as human activities and climate change. 
Scotland is home to around one third of the EU’s breeding seabirds and their status is an important indicator for assessing the state of the marine environment. The average breeding numbers of 12 species of breeding seabirds in Scotland have declined. By 2016, breeding numbers of these species were 62% of their 1986 level.487

Global Target 15.5 aims to take urgent and significant action to reduce the degradation of natural habitats, halt the loss of biodiversity and, by 2020, protect and prevent the extinction of threatened species. The index of abundance of terrestrial breeding birds in Scotland (used as an indicator of biodiversity) was 119.0 in 2017 (against a value of 100 in 1994).

Performance Framework
Invasive non-native species (15.8)
The official statistics report on protected areas condition states that invasive species constitute ‘the single biggest negative impact on feature condition’ in Scotland. Island ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to INNS impacts, a major concern given the important, protected biodiversity that Scotland’s islands host. Rhododendron ponticum, originally from Spain, is the main INNS threat to terrestrial biodiversity, especially woodlands. Rhododendron ponticum forms dense thickets, shading out flowering plants, bryophytes and lichens, and preventing tree regeneration. SNH and Scottish Forestry have drawn together the experiences and outcomes of past and current projects to create a national strategy that identifies priority areas for rhododendron control associated with woodland in Scotland, and to produce supporting information and guidance. Public and private land managers are working together in several areas of Scotland, including Glen Creran in Argyll and Torridon. Funding is available through the Forest Grant Scheme to support such work in priority areas.
The Wildlife and Natural Environment (Scotland) Act 2011 enabled Scotland to adopt the internationally recognised three-stage approach to dealing with invasive non-native species, which aims to:
• prevent the release and spread of non-native animal and plant species into areas where they can cause damage to native species and habitats and to economic interests;
• ensure a rapid response to new populations can be undertaken; and
• ensure effective control and eradication measures can be carried out when problem situations arise.
Scotland is working with partners across the UK to minimise the risk posed, and the negative impacts caused, by INNS in Scotland and action to address this is coordinated across the UK, particularly across Great Britain. The GB Programme Board, gives strategic consideration of the threat of INNS across Great Britain. Much of the work carried out is underpinned by the Great Britain Invasive Non-Native Species Strategy, which the Scottish Government launched in partnership with Defra and the Welsh Government in 2015.
The following two groups have been set up in Scotland:
• the Non-Native Species Action Group, to ensure effective policy co-ordination and practical implementation in Scotland; and
• the Statutory Group on Non-Native Species, to oversee the use of new statutory powers and coordinate work between the statutory bodies with specific responsibilities for non-native species in Scotland.
The Data Picture: Invasive nonnative species
Coverage: Scotland
The Goals aim to significantly reduce the impact of invasive alien species on land and water ecosystems and control or eradicate the priority species.
In Scotland, the proportion of assessments recording invasive species as a negative pressure forms the single biggest negative impact on feature condition. The proportion has increased to 21.1% of all pressures in 2017/18, from 20.5% in 2016/17 and 20.0% in 2015/16.

Wales
Frameworks for conserving ecosystems (15.1, 
15.2, 15.5) 
Wales covers a land area of 2,078,224 hectares 488, which supports agricultural industry and provides homes to a variety of wildlife. Wales’s natural resources underpin its well-being and its prosperity, health, culture and identity. With legislation, it has embedded biodiversity and natural resource management into policy. For instance, the Environment (Wales) Act 2016 ensures natural resources and ecosystems are resilient and can provide benefits now and for the future.
However, progress has been slow. The State of Natural 
Resources Report, produced by Natural Resources Wales, highlighted that no ecosystem in Wales is currently showing all the attributes of resilience, which is impacting its ecosystems to provide benefits.489
Work is underway to remedy this. For instance, the 
Natural Resources Policy sets Wales’s priorities for the sustainable management of natural resources. These include: delivering nature-based solutions; increasing resource efficiency and renewable energy; and taking a place-based approach. Through this, Wales is ensuring that the national priorities for sustainable management of natural resources also inform local delivery.
Activity snapshot:
Brecon Beacons National Park Ambassador Schools is a programme to support schools within and around the National Park in making the most of the outdoors for learning. It gives pupils and teachers a chance to take what they learn in the classroom out into the environment, giving pupils valuable hands on experience.
Woodland and land management (15.1, 15.2)
The Woodlands for Wales strategy outlines the commitment to bring more Welsh woodland into management, expand its cover and increase its resilience so they can deliver more benefits to the people of Wales. In the past it adopted a target of planting 100,000 hectares of trees between 2010-30. Planting rates in the first seven years of that period have only been a fraction of the required 5,000 hectares per year. However, Wales aims to increase tree planting to at least 2,000 hectares per year and will increase this to 4,000 hectares as rapidly as possible (see Goals 6, 11, 12, and 13).
Activity snapshot:
Plant! is a collaborative programme between 
Welsh Government, the Woodland Trust and Natural Resources Wales. It was launched in 2008 and aims to plant a tree for every child born or adopted in Wales since then. To date, over 320,000 broadleaf trees (over 147 hectares) have been planted across Wales. From 1 April 2014 the commitment was extended to plant an additional tree in Uganda for every child.
Peatland (15.1, 15.3) 
The total area of peat soil in Wales is approximately 90,995 hectares (4.3%).490 Drainage, land use change, inappropriate grazing, burning and air pollution have all damaged and degraded Welsh peatlands. Over 70% of peatlands were estimated to have been modified and in degraded condition.491 This has negatively impacted their ability to deliver a range of ecosystem services. Wales continues to invest in tree planting and peatland, recognising the well-being benefits they provide, and committed to increase the Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry sink in Wales by the year 2030 by reducing carbon loss from peatlands and building carbon stores within biomass (see Goal 13). 
Activity snapshot:
Wales’s Sustainable Management Scheme programme is funding a range of projects which include a peatland element, chief among which is the Snowdonia National Park led Realising the Natural Capital of Welsh Peatlands project. This project has a very broad remit with on-the ground restoration; and, developing applications for PES support through the Peatland Code mechanism.
Planning policy (15.1, 15.5, 15.9)
Taken together, the National Planning Policy and the National Development Framework sets Wales’s national planning context and supports the delivery of the Natural Resources Policy at the national level. At the local level, Natural Resources Wales’s area statements will provide a vital local evidence base for the sustainable management of natural resources, which local authorities must have regard to in their local development plans. The National Planning Policy, Wales provides for continued protection for Best and Most Versatile Agricultural Land (see Goals 9, 11, and 13).
Flood management (15.1)
Flooding and coastal erosion are two of the most visible effects of the changes in Wales’s climate.  The National Strategy for flood and coastal erosion risk management sets out how Wales will help communities, the public sector and other organisations to work together to manage flood and coastal erosion risk.
Wales will consult on a new National Strategy in July 2019 further supporting the use of natural flood management and adaptive measures, strengthening its stance on prevention and complementing new planning policy and Welsh legislation. 
Wales funds schemes run by local authorities and Natural Resources Wales to reduce risk of flooding and coastal erosion to communities. Between 2016- 21 it is investing almost £152 million capital funding in flood and coastal erosion risk management schemes. This is in addition to the £150 million investment through the Coastal Risk Management Programme, with construction starting from April 2019 for three years (see Goals 9, 11, and 13).
Woodland and land management (15.1, 15.2)
In Northern Ireland, the Forest Service safeguards the plant health status in support of maintaining productive agricultural, horticultural and forest industries, and to protect the wider environment. In 2017 the Plant Health Directorate published the Northern Ireland Plant Health Risk Register. 
The register identifies and prioritises for surveillance and action the highest threats to plant health status. It is publicly available online 492 and benefits from a revised generic Plant Health Contingency plan published by Forest Service in 2017. It is in close collaboration with the rest of the UK Plant Health Services to better predict, plan and prepare for plant health pest outbreaks.
Peatland (15.1, 15.3)
Northern Ireland’s peatlands have been designated as Special Areas of Conservation and contribute to its protected area network. Plans are being developed which will identify measures to maintain or improve sites’ condition and help increase the percentage of protected peatland under favourable management. In 2017, Northern Ireland (alongside the border region of 
Ireland and Western Scotland) received European Union INTERREG VA Programme funding including for €4.9 million for restoration of 2,228 hectares of blanket bog across the three countries including Garron Plateau in 
County Antrim.493
UK action around the world
Biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation are global issues, requiring global solutions. The 2019 Global Assessment from the Inter-Governmental Panel on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services reported that most of the globe’s biodiversity had been significantly impacted, with the majority of ecosystems and biodiversity indicators showing rapid decline.494
Internationally, the UK has contributed to the protection and restoration of forests and wider biodiversity outcomes through funding and resource mobilisation, coordinating global action and scientific endeavour. UK funding provided in support of biodiversity in developing countries, particularly least developed countries and small-island developing states, has risen from a baseline of £38.8 million of Official Development Assistance (ODA) per annum between 2006-10 to over £136 million in 2015. Provisional ODA figures for 2016 and 2017 are £108 million and £138 million.495
Supporting biodiversity in developing countries (15.a, 15.b) 
The UK demonstrates its commitment to Leave No One 
Behind through its continued investment in the Darwin Initiative. Since its establishment in 1992, the initiative has awarded £161 million to 1,155 projects that preserve and increase biodiversity, across developing countries.496 Applications must focus on sustainable development for the reduction of poverty and consider gender equality (see Goals 1, 8, 10, and 13). Tackling illegal wildlife trade (15.7, 15.a, 15.b, 15.c)
The UK is leading efforts to tackle international wildlife trade (IWT) through the prevention of trafficking and poaching. It is investing more than £36 million (201421) to take action to counter IWT while also investing in wider conservation programmes which will have an impact on tackling the illegal wildlife trade. 
The UK announced one of the world’s toughest domestic bans on ivory in April 2018 and in October 2018 convened the world’s largest Illegal Wildlife Trade Conference. Over 1,300 participants took part, with representatives of over 400 organisations including Standard Chartered, Barclays, Citigroup and BNP Paribas, and representatives from over 70 countries. 
Of those countries, 65 adopted the London 2018 Declaration and significant new commitments were also made by the UK, including extra funding for counter poaching training for rangers in Africa; funding to tackle demand for products from IWT; £6 million to support transboundary projects through the IWT Challenge Fund; and £3.5 million to help UN Office of Drugs and Crime and Egmont Centre of FIU Excellence and Leadership develop financial crime investigation capacity where IWT-related money laundering may be taking place.
Global climate change (15.2, 15.a, 15.b)
To tackle climate change globally, the UK established International Climate Finance (ICF), investing £5.8 billion (2016-21) to support developing countries respond to the challenges and opportunities climate change presents.
The UK’s contributions to forest funds through ICF support its pledge to Leave No One Behind. It helps communities protect and restore important, diverse and fragile forest ecosystems whilst using land in ways that improve productivity. Through the ICF, the UK has also: 
• Invested £65.1 million in the BioCarbon Fund Initiative for Sustainable Forest Landscapes,497 to coalesce multiple land-use projects to achieve a bigger, landscape-sized transformation;
• Invested £56.5 million in the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) Carbon Fund, which funds a partnership of governments, businesses, civil society, and indigenous peoples focussed on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, forest carbon stock conservation, the sustainable management of forests, and the enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries; and
• Established the Forest Governance, Markets and 
Climate Programme, with a budget of £250 million (2011-21), to bring about governance and market reforms to reduce illegal forest resources use and benefit vulnerable people dependent on forests for their livelihood (see Goals 10 and 13).
In addition, the UK provided £210 million for the sixth stage of the Global Environment Facility programme (2014-18). In 2018, the UK pledged to give up to £250 million over four years to support its efforts to tackle marine plastic pollution and IWT.
Nagoya Protocol (15.6)
The Nagoya Protocol provides a legal framework for the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources – to ensure donor countries and their communities benefit financially when companies overseas develop products using genetic material from their countries’ plants, animals, fungi and microorganisms. Legislation applies to sectors including food and beverage; pharmaceutical; cosmetic and personal care; animal and plant breeding; biotechnology; bio-control and academia.
Challenges and next steps
Delivery in the UK 
Despite many losses, there are real points of progress on which to build. The UK’s challenge is to do just that. Leaving the EU presents the opportunity to formulate agricultural and forestry policies that better meet UK priorities. In England, the challenge will be designing a new environmental land management system that is the cornerstone of the country’s agricultural policy after EU exit, to reward farmers and land managers for delivering environmental outcomes and public goods such as habitat protection and stimulating public engagement with the countryside, supporting health and well-being. 
The European Union (Withdrawal) Act will ensure that the whole body of existing EU environmental law, including the Habitats and Wild Birds Directives, continues to have effect in UK law following the UK’s departure from the EU. Following EU exit, Scotland has committed to maintain or exceed EU environmental standards (see Goals 6, 11, 12, and 13). Actions to bolster domestic progress
Across the UK, work is underway to strengthen progress on Goal 15. In England, the 25 Year Environment Plan is a step-change in ambition for wildlife and the natural environment, committing to over 200 actions to enhance the environment in England and internationally, addressing Global Targets across Goal 15 (linking to Goals 6, 9, 11, 12 and 13), including:
• replacing the current Biodiversity Strategy with a post-2020 Strategy for Nature, more clearly aligned with the Pollinator and upcoming Peatland and Tree Strategies. To be published in 2019, the England 
Peatland Strategy will create a Lowland Agricultural Peat Taskforce. An England Tree Strategy will be published in 2020 following consultation;
• developing a Nature Recovery Network;
• developing a new Northern Forest, with 50 million trees to be planted over the next 25 years (with a further 1 million ‘trees for schools’ announced subsequently). By the end of the current Parliament, 11 million trees are to be planted, including 1 million urban trees. Separately, Wales is developing an outline of the First Minister’s vision of a national forest. A national forest could accelerate reforestation and unlock major economic and environmental benefits;
• bringing forward an Environment Bill which establishes an independent statutory body to hold government to account and enshrine core environmental principles in UK law; and
• pledging to eliminate all avoidable plastic waste, like microbeads and straws. The UK government has introduced one of the world’s toughest bans on microbeads, and following an open consultation, a ban on the supply of plastic straws, drinks stirrers and cotton buds comes into force in April 2020 in England (see Goal 14).
The Woodland Carbon Guarantee will deliver tree planting, helping offset carbon emissions and support wildlife. Up to £50 million of guaranteed future payments over the next 30 years will be provided to those who plant qualifying woodland, to purchase carbon credits as trees grow and sequester carbon. 
Scotland is currently developing a new Environment Strategy and Wales is placing climate issues at the centre of planning through the development of a Predictive Agriculture Land Classification Map (expected August 2020). The map uses the best available information to predict the grade of land and will help local planning authorities, developers, surveyors and land use managers make informed decisions over the use of land in the planning system and to target survey work to the most appropriate locations. 
Northern Ireland is also identifying where necessary management measures should be introduced for terrestrial and marine protected areas. The focus between 2017-22 will be on bringing the protected area network into favourable management. The trend should improve from 2017 onwards.
In response to the global Climate Emergency and following the advice from the Climate Change Committee, the Scottish Government will be widely consulting on the transformational policies needed to feed into the update of the Climate Change Plan. It will also intensify its commitment under the Biodiversity Roadmap 2020 and is committed to helping to shape the new post-2020 international biodiversity targets. The Scottish Government is working with Scottish Natural Heritage to coordinate this thinking, including ensuring that there is a sound evidence base on which to base future action and to help develop a strategic response to new targets.
Tackling global biodiversity loss
Biodiversity loss is a major challenge facing countries around the world. In 2019, the UK announced a global review, led by Professor Sir Partha Dasgupta, to assess the economic value of biodiversity. Its objective will be to quantify the economic benefits of biodiversity globally and identify actions that can be taken to simultaneously enhance biodiversity and deliver economic prosperity. The review is due to report in 2020.
The UK is committed to leading action to develop a new post-2020 global framework for biodiversity under the Convention on Biological Diversity that is ambitious and transformational. It must seek to align with, and be informed by, related global frameworks such as the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management, as well as the Goals.

Goal 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions
Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build inclusive institutions at all levels
Summary
The UK is committed to promoting the principles of inclusion and respect, ensuring all citizens have access to a justice system that is supported by strong and accountable institutions. These are the foundations of a peaceful society. 
There has been a long-term fall in crime in the UK, including crimes that demonstrate a disregard for human rights, such as hate crime which has fallen by 40% over the last decade.498 There has been progress on protection for and rights of minorities and vulnerable people, improving the UK’s criminal justice system, tackling fraud and corruption, and increasing transparency in public services. Nevertheless, challenges remain such as modern slavery, domestic violence and sexual offences, including sexual abuse of children, which has led to more victims coming forward. 
This chapter explores the UK’s approach to deliver recent action under Goal 16 and its Global Targets. This includes the UK’s work to build up institutions to prevent and tackle crime; uphold human rights; and ensure transparent, accountable and inclusive institutions which deliver participatory decision-making. Responsibility for policing and criminal justice is devolved in Scotland and Northern Ireland, which is reflected in their different approaches to Goal 16. 
Leave No One Behind examples:
• The UK’s national LGBT survey launched in 2017 provides evidence about the experiences of LGBT people in the UK. It received over 100,000 responses and is the largest of its kind in the world. The responses helped form the LGBT Action Plan which contains 75 comprehensive commitments on LGBT equality, including hate crime in England. This has led to £500,000 being awarded to the LGBT third sector to support LGBT survivors of domestic abuse. The UK government also continues to fund an LGBT helpline for survivors and has committed to drafting guidance for service providers and commissioners on how to support LGBT survivors. 
• In Scotland, the Victims Taskforce has been established to improve support, advice and information for victims of crime. The primary role of the Taskforce is to coordinate and drive action to improve the experiences of victims and witnesses within the criminal justice system, whilst ensuring a fair justice system for those accused of crime.
• In Wales, Regional Community Cohesion Teams work across all 22 Welsh local authorities to break down barriers to inclusion and integration across marginalised groups; support migrants, refugees and asylum seekers during the integration process and tackle discrimination, hostility, tensions and extremism.
• In Northern Ireland, the Urban Villages Initiative is fostering positive identities, building community capacity and opening and connecting communities with a history of deprivation and tension to improve relations within and between communities. To date, almost £7 million has been committed to 80 projects across five Urban Village areas; over 3,000 project participants have demonstrated positive changes to behaviour; and more than 4,000 have reported improved attitudes and opinions towards people from different backgrounds.

Action in the UK
Delivering peace and security for all (16.1, 16.2, 
16.3, 16.4)
Everyone has a right to feel safe and secure. While total crime has fallen since 2015 499 there has been a concerning rise in some low-volume but high-harm violence including knife crime 500. In response to this, the UK government is undertaking consultations on a legal duty to support a multi-agency ‘public health’ approach to violence across the UK, building on lessons learned in Scotland. The threat from organised crime, which costs the UK £37 billion a year and causes more deaths than all other national security threats combined, grew.501 2018 saw the launch of the Serious and Organised Crime Strategy which outlines how the UK government will target organised criminals and bring them to justice. And following the appalling terrorist attacks in 2017, the UK’s counter-terrorism strategy sets out how the UK aims to leave no safe space for terrorists to recruit or act. 
The Data Picture: Number of crime offences 
Coverage: England and Wales
Total crime has been decreasing over recent years. In the year ending March 2018, the number of estimated crimes was 6.1 million, a decrease of 10% compared to year ending March 2015 and 41% compared to year ending March 2009. This does not include fraud and computer misuse.

According to the 2017/18 Crime Survey for England and Wales, only 64% of women compared to 87% of men felt very safe or fairly safe when walking alone after dark.502
The Data Picture: Homicides
Coverage: England and Wales
Homicides have risen in the last three years, after falling between 2013 and 2015. In the year ending March 2018, there were 726 homicides, an increase of 42% compared to year ending March 2015. Currently the number of homicides per 100,000 population is 1.24. This highlights the need to make progress in reducing violent crime.

The UK’s efforts to combat child trafficking includes concerted action which has had an impact at home and overseas. In 2016, the Crime Survey for England and Wales showed that 16% of respondents aged 18-29 had experienced assault by the age of 16.503 Ending abuse, exploitation, trafficking and all forms of violence against children remains a UK priority. The UK has provided £2.2 million through the Child Trafficking Protection Fund to test innovative ways to protect vulnerable children in the UK and overseas who are at risk of being trafficked.504 Independent Child Trafficking Advocates an independent source of advice for trafficked children will be rolled out across England and Wales to help child victims of trafficking, to navigate the complexities of the social care, immigration and justice systems. This is in addition to an ambitious programme of work to address the sexual exploitation of children which began in 2015. This was followed by the 2017 Tackling Child Sexual Exploitation: Progress Report and a £40 million package of measures to protect young people and tackle offenders. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse was also established to draw out systemic lessons. 
The Data Picture: Modern slavery 
Coverage: England and Wales
The number of modern slavery prosecutions has grown since 2015 with around 300 prosecutions in each of the last three years. The proportion of prosecutions resulting in a conviction has fluctuated over time but has risen in the last year following reductions in the previous two years

Activity snapshot:
Hope for Justice’s Independent Modern Slavery Advocates (IMSA) programme provides frontline specialist advocacy to victims of Modern Slavery enabling them to understand their rights and choices; access services; and ensure their voice is heard. This enhances the ability of victims to engage in criminal and civil justice processes, both of which are essential to securing justice for victims and creating a hostile environment for exploiters. Where victims accessed advocacy services, 100% were able to attend and give evidence when requested. 
Activity snapshot:
In 2018, De Montfort University (DMU) Leicester was appointed as the global hub for Goal 16 by the UN Academic Impact initiative. Being the only UK university granted the status, the recognition followed work on the UN’s JoinTogether campaign to lead higher education across the world in highlighting the issue of forced migration. DMU’s projects focus on expanding the JoinTogether network which now has 100 university members; pioneering work to combat modern slavery; and a project to spread democracy to disenfranchised young people on inner-city estates. It also shares research, projects and good practice on Goal 16.
According to a recent survey of experts, modern slavery in Leicester is a key issue. DMU has teamed up with the national charity Unseen to promote its hotline that aims to get victims of modern slavery to come forward to stop their exploitation. The helpline has been relaunched in Leicester with a media campaign to raise awareness of how people can report modern slavery. DMU has also partnered organisations, such as the police, local authorities and charities, in forming the Leicester and Leicestershire Modern Slavery Action Group to help combat the problem. 
Achieving inclusion and respect for human rights (16.1, 16.a, 16.b)
The UK has a long tradition of ensuring that rights and liberties are protected. There are three national human rights institutions: Equality and Human Rights Commission (covering England and Wales), Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission and Scottish Human Rights Commission. 
Hate crime goes against the UK’s values of unity, inclusivity tolerance and mutual respect. It is important to understand who is targeted by hate crime to ensure that no one is left behind. In 2017/18, racetargeted hate crimes in England and Wales accounted for the largest proportion of offences – 76%. This is a long-standing trend. Hate crimes targeted at religion accounted for 9% of offences, an increase of 
2 percentage points compared to the proportion in 
2015/16.505
In 2016, the UK government published an action plan to improve its response. It had five themes: preventing hate crime by challenging beliefs and attitudes; responding to hate crime; increasing reporting; improving support for victims and building understanding. This corresponded with a fall in the prevalence of hate crime experienced. Ensuring access to justice for all (16.2, 16.3, 16.5) 
The ability of individuals to resolve legal issues and access support when they need it is vital to a just society. The Legal Support Action Plan sets out the UK government’s approach to support access to justice by exploring how it can best help people resolve legal problems at the earliest opportunity and avoid the need for unnecessary court proceedings, this includes investing £5 million in an innovation fund to explore how technology can support access to justice; doubling funding for litigants in person; ensuring early intervention by delivering a series of pilots; and piloting an expansion of legal aid to cover early legal advice in a specific area of social welfare law. The UK government also published a review of legal aid for inquests in an effort to seek a more supportive, accessible and effective inquest system. The review concluded that whilst the vast majority of inquests are inquisitorial and fair, there is a need to do more to ensure that inquests do not become adversarial; that the coroner is fully in control; that the behaviour of lawyers is as it should be; and that there is a need to improve guidance literature for those navigating the process in an effort to seek a more supportive, accessible and effective inquest system. The UK government will also ensure inquests are more sympathetic to the needs of the bereaved; improve family participation; and improve guidance and advice available.
The Data Picture: Prison population on remand 
Coverage: England and Wales
The Goals highlight the need to ensure equal access to justice. The UK works with those in trouble and offenders to transform their lives  and create a safer and better society. This includes ensuring the appropriate and effective use of remand in custody and bail for all individuals in the criminal justice system. In 2018, 11.2% of  the prison population (9,285 prisoners) were held on remand, broadly stable compared to 2017  but a decrease of 2.5 percentage points compared to 2015.

Activity snapshot:
In line with the recommendations of Charlie Taylor’s review of youth justice, the UK government is working to deliver Secure Schools – a new type of youth secure provision that places education, healthcare and purposeful activity at its heart, to rehabilitate children in custody and reduce reoffending.
The UK is striving to make its criminal justice system fairer and ensure that it promotes equality. David Lammy MP’s 2017 review into racial disparities, identified a lack of trust in the justice system among black, Asian and ethnic minority people. The review highlighted the need to further address barriers to access to justice. In October 2018, an update  on progress outlined plans to tackle racial disparity, including: work to improve the diversity of those working in the criminal justice system; pilot alternatives to prosecution for those who are eligible; and address disproportionate outcomes in procedures.
Criminal justice agencies work directly with victims of crime to ensure they get the help they need. In 2018, the UK government published a Victims Strategy to improve the experience and rights of victims of crime, especially the most vulnerable. The Victims’ Code, which sets out the services that victims should receive, is being revised to better reflect victims’ needs. The UK government will also improve reporting, monitoring and transparency to strengthen compliance with the Victims’ Code and ensure all victims are able to make a personal statement describing the impact the crime has had on them and their family.
Activity snapshot:
The Greater Manchester (GM) Whole System 
Approach brings together local agencies (criminal justice, statutory and voluntary) to provide the holistic, targeted support that female offenders need. Fully operational since January 2015, emerging evidence shows:
• A 55% reduction in the number of GM adult women arrested between 2014/15 and 2017/18.
• As of the end of March 2017, 91% of women assessed had multiple needs (such as mental health, substance misuse and accommodation). On average, women who engage with the WSA in GM were making positive progress in all areas of assessed need.
Creating accountable institutions (16.4, 16.5, 16.6, 
16.7, 16.8, 16.9, 16.10)
The UK is working to reduce corruption to help build strong institutions. In 2017, the UK published its AntiCorruption Strategy, building on a 2014 action plan and a 2016 London summit. In 2017, the Criminal Finances Act gave agencies powers to recover the proceeds of crime, tackle money laundering and combat the financing of terrorism. A 2018 report by the Financial Action Task Force (the global standard setter) on the UK’s work to tackle money laundering and illicit financial flows that finance terrorism was positive – stating that the UK has a ‘…robust regime to effectively combat money laundering and terrorist financing’. To prevent fraud and corruption in government institutions, the UK government has invested in a Centre of Expertise for Counter Fraud and developed a functional standard for all government departments and bodies. 
Transparency is also key to preventing fraud and corruption. The Bribery Act 2010 puts a requirement on companies to have in place adequate procedures to prevent bribery. This encourages transparency, as it is likely to be a prominent feature in such anti-bribery procedures. 
Through the Open Government Partnership National Action Plan, the UK is working to improve data transparency – a significant step in facilitating transparency at all levels. For the first time, data on reports of corruption made to police in England and Wales is published. This is in addition to public data on other crime. 
For 30 years, the Crime Survey for England and Wales has provided vital evidence about the changing levels of crime and been used to evaluate and develop crime reduction policies. In 2016 the Investigatory Powers Act was overhauled, providing a new framework to govern use and oversight of the investigatory powers available to law enforcement, security and intelligence agencies. 
Activity snapshot:
Freedom of Information is a vital tool for transparency, giving citizens the power to hold public authorities to account. But it’s not always easy to work out how to request information. 
MySociety developed WhatDoTheyKnow. com, contributing to Global Target 16.10. Citizens, activists and journalists have uncovered important information through the site, oftentimes setting the news agenda. Information uncovered this way has led to at least 40 national media stories. 
The UK also has comprehensive birth registration systems in place and it is a legal requirement to register a birth in the UK within 42 days (21 days in Scotland).
Scotland
A driver of Goal 16 is the promotion and protection of human rights. Scotland has national human rights institutions and a National Action Plan for Human Rights which has outcomes that have explicitly embedded the Goals. Scotland has a specified National Outcome to “respect, protect and fulfil human rights and live free from discrimination” and values of respecting the rule of law and acting openly and transparently in the National Performance Framework.
Safer Scotland (16.1, 16.2, 16.4)
Justice in Scotland: vision and priorities sets out the vision for a ‘safe, just and resilient Scotland’ and is focussed on improving outcomes for people across Scotland, providing an over-arching and consistent framework to which everyone across the sector can align their efforts.
The Data Picture: Perceptions of local crime rate
Coverage: Scotland
Around three quarters of adults in Scotland believe that the local crime rate has stayed the same or reduced in the last two years.

Source: Scottish Government, National Performance Framework
Scotland has become safer over the past decade. 
Overall, levels of crime and victimisation have fallen. The Scottish Crime and Justice Survey (SCJS), which includes crimes not reported to the police, estimates that the overall number of crimes experienced by adults in Scotland in 2017/18 has fallen by 42% since 2008/09, and by 16% since 2016/17 to 602,000, the lowest level ever estimated by the survey.506 The SCJS also shows that there has been an 11 percentage point increase in the proportion of adults who said they felt very or fairly safe walking alone after dark in their local area, from 66% in 2008/09 to 77% 2017/18.507 Additionally, recorded crime in 2017/18 is at its second lowest level since 1974. The total number of crimes recorded by the police in Scotland in 2017-18 was 244,504. Over the past ten years crime has decreased and by over a third (35%) since 2008/09 in Scotland.508 
The Scottish Government reported in 2017 that the number of people under 18 convicted of handling an offensive weapon has fallen by 85% since 2008/09.509 Action has been taken to reduce and prevent violence through on-going support and investment in the Violence Reduction Unit, and specific interventions including the Mentors in Violence Prevention Scotland Programme, Medics Against Violence ‘Ask, Support, Care’ programme, the No Knives Better Lives Programme and the hospital-based Navigators programme.
Over the past ten years the number of victims of homicide has fallen by 39% from 97 in 2008/09 to 59 in 2017/18. Over the same period the rate of homicide victimisation fell by 43% from 19 to 11 victims per million population. For male victims, this rate fell by 40% from 28 to 17 victims per million population and for female victims the rate fell by 52% from 10 to 5 victims per million population.510
The Data Picture: Crime Victimisation
Coverage: Scotland
In 2017/18, 12.5% of adults reported being a victim of crime in Scotland.

Performance Framework
The number of sexual crimes recorded by the police have increased by 97% over the past ten years from 6,331 in 2008/09 to 12,487 in 2017/18.511 This longterm rise is due to a range of factors. Part of this trend of increased reporting may reflect a greater willingness by victims to come forward, including to report crimes which may have not taken place recently. Another component to the increase of total sexual crime in 2017/18 is also due to there being 421 new crimes of disclosing or threatening to disclose an intimate image.512 These are as a result of the Abusive Behaviour and Sexual Harm (Scotland) Act 2016 and are new to the sexual crime group. Previous Scottish Government research highlighted that a growth in sexual ‘cybercrime’ accounts for a significant proportion of the growth in sexual crime in recent years. 
Domestic abuse remains a prevalent issue – latest findings from the Scottish Crime and Justice Survey show that in 2016/18 15.6% of adults report having experienced physical or psychological partner abuse since the age of 16, with women (20.0%) almost twice as likely as men (10.9%) to have experienced such abuse.513 To tackle this, the Scottish approach is framed by Scotland’s Equally Safe strategy.
Activity snapshot:
The Caledonian System works with men convicted of domestic abuse offences to help them recognise their abuse and take responsibility for themselves and their relationships with others. An evaluation of the Caledonian System, set up to address men’s domestic abuse, shows that women feel safer and that men who complete the Caledonian System programme pose a lower risk to partners and children.
The Equally Safe strategy for preventing and eradicating violence against women and girls was originally produced in 2014, updated in 2016, and further updated in 2018. It focusses on the need for prevention of violence and sets out how Scotland will develop a performance framework to determine whether Scotland is realising ambitions. The Abusive Behaviour and Sexual Harm (Scotland) Act 2016 has introduced a ‘statutory domestic abuse aggravator’ to ensure courts take domestic abuse into account when sentencing offenders. 
In 2015 the Scottish Government published the Serious Organised Crime Strategy, which aims to reduce the harm caused by serious organised crime by ensuring all partner bodies collaborate together. 
Human trafficking and sexual exploitation  (16.1, 16.2)
The Trafficking and Exploitation Strategy published in 
May 2017 identifies three areas of action where the Scottish Government will focus efforts: Identify victims and support them to safety and recovery, identify perpetrators and disrupt their activity, and address the conditions that foster trafficking and exploitation. Sections 9 and 10 of the Human Trafficking and 
Exploitation (Scotland) Act 2015 places a duty on Scottish Ministers to provide support and assistance to victims of all forms of human trafficking and exploitation and of slavery, servitude and forced or compulsory labour. This duty came into force on 1 April 2018. Support and assistance that may be provided includes but is not limited to:
• accommodation;
• day to day living;
• medical advice and treatment; • counselling, legal advice, repatriation; and .
• information about other services available.
Democracy and public participation
The Local Governance Review was launched to ensure that Scotland’s diverse communities and different places have greater control and influence over decisions that affect them most. As part of this 4,000 people took part in #DemocracyMatters conversations about the future of community decision-making.
Scotland also supports participatory budgeting as a resource to build on the wider development of participatory democracy with over 100,000 voting on how money is spent in their local community in the last two years.
The current Scottish Open Government Action 
Plan, was developed in partnership between 
Scottish Government, the Convention of Scottish 
Local Authorities (COSLA) and the Scottish Open Government Partnership civil society network to seek to reach across the system of public services. The Action Plan contains commitments in five areas:
1. Financial performance and transparency.
2. Providing a framework to support systemic change in Scottish Government to improve the way people are able to participate in open policy-making and service delivery.
3. Improvements to the way information and data are used.
4. Improving the accountability of public services.
5. Transparency and participation in Scotland as the UK exits the EU.
Wales
Delivering peace and security for all 
Goal 16 highlights the need for people to feel safe in their community, and one of Wales’s well-being goals aims for safe communities. In 2016/17, the National Survey for Wales showed that 73% of people felt safe after dark; whether at home, walking in their local area, travelling by public transport or travelling by car. Around 80% of people felt safe walking in the local area or travelling by public transport, while 97% felt safe both being at home and travelling by car.514 In addition to the 440 police personnel enforcing law and order across Wales, as part of its focus on making communities safer, Wales provides specific funding to support an additional 500 Community Safety Officers.
From the National Survey Wales 2017-2018, a question concerning confidence in ability to access the legal and justice system revealed that only 18% of respondents were very confident that they could access ways to resolve legal issues, whether through the advice of solicitors, advice centres or through the courts.515
Activity snapshot:
The Heritage Lottery funded Wales for Peace project brought together partners from third sector, higher education and grassroots community groups to explore how Wales has contributed to peace in the 100 years since World War One to encourage action on peace. During the project, 500 volunteers have uncovered hidden histories of peace to inspire future generations, and hundreds of thousands visits exhibitions and events. 
Activity snapshot:
The Welsh Centre for International Affairs (WCIA) is working with primary and secondary schools across Wales to use peace as a tool to improve school outcomes.
Ongoing support is offered to schools as they embed peace in the school ethos and take social action in their school and community. The programme specifically, improves skills in critical thinking, team work, problem-solving and communication, at the same time as reducing bullying, discrimination, racism and negative behaviours in schools. The project has reduced records of negative behaviour; increased involvement in pupil voice (up 300%); increased engagement in assemblies; and social action taken in the community e.g. fundraising for a project for refugees. Since 2016 the Peace Schools Scheme has reached 10,000 pupils and 15 schools in Wales.
Inclusion and respect for human rights
To support community cohesion eight Regional Community Cohesion Teams work across all 22 Welsh local authorities. These work at a strategic and local level with public services and community organisations to break down barriers to inclusion and integration across marginalised groups; support migrants, refugees and asylum seekers during the integration process; and tackle discrimination, hostility, tensions and extremism. The teams will be expanded from April 2020 to increase their capacity to provide support around issues related to the UK’s anticipated withdrawal from the EU.
Of the recorded hate crimes during 2017/18 in Wales, 68% were reported as race hate crimes, 6% were linked to religion, 20% to sexual orientation, and 9% to disability.516 Wales funds a Hate Crime Reporting and Support Centre, managed by Victim Support Cymru, which provides support to victims of all categories of hate crimes and incidents. Funding for this service has  increased and, in addition, a new grant fund has been established for organisations working with BAME communities at risk of hate crime, reflecting the extent to which these communities are affected.  This new grant is in addition to the existing Equality and Inclusion Funding Programme, which works across many strands of equality including race; gender; disability; Gypsies, Roma and Travellers; LGBT+; refugees and asylum seekers as well as hate crime. 
One in six of all recorded hate crimes in Wales is judged to have been related to sexual orientation, though Stonewall Cymru research indicates that many such incidents are not reported to the police.517 Wales is one of three Home Office funded Early Adaptor areas for the Independent Child Trafficking Advocates Pilot. The Pilot in Wales is operated by Barnardo’s Cymru. From January 2017 to 31 December 2018 over 200 children across Wales had been referred into the National Referral Mechanism and are being safeguarded. The countries from where the children are referred include the UK, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Albania and Romania. In addition, Wales has brought forward legislation to remove the defence of reasonable punishment. The objective of the Children (Abolition of the Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill is to help protect children’s rights by prohibiting physical punishment by parents and those acting in loco parentis. The prohibition is consistent with Wales’s commitment to children’s rights under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC). The UNCRC recognises the right of the child to “respect of their human dignity, physical integrity and equal protection under the law.”518
The Wales Victim Response Pathway operates across all of Wales and incorporates the use of the Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conference process for survivors of domestic abuse. It is a victim-focussed information sharing and risk management meeting attended by all key agencies, where high risk cases are discussed.
Develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions at all levels (16.3, 16.6) 
Wales has introduced legislation to make Welsh law more accessible, clear and straight forward to use, and is taking steps to improve digital accessibility of the law.
Social welfare advice services play a key role in ensuring everyone in Wales has access to justice and is an important part of strong, cohesive communities. Although justice is not devolved, Wales supports social welfare advice services to ensure everyone in Wales has access to justice. Between April to December 2018, these services supported over 47,000 people and secured over £31 million in extra money for people who claimed welfare benefits.
In relation to the National Assembly and Local 
Government elections, Wales’s policy is to empower 16 to 17-year-olds and all foreign nationals to vote in these elections to ensure greater inclusivity and promote citizenship. Legislation will also be brought forward to ensure the conduct of elections is free from bias, and that candidates are not harassed and to make it easier to register to vote.
Northern Ireland
Delivering peace and security for all
Northern Ireland’s approach to peaceful societies is underpinned by values such as respect for each other and tackling hate crimes in all forms.
Addressing the legacy of the past and creating space for sharing between traditionally divided and new communities in Northern Ireland are particular challenges. Results from the 2017/18 Northern Ireland Crime Survey (NICS) estimate that 7.9% of all households and their adult occupants were victims of at least one NICS crime during the 12 months prior to interview, unchanged from 2016/17. The rate has reduced by almost two-thirds since NICS 1998 (23.0%) when the measure was first reported.519
Goal 16 has been mapped to Northern Ireland’s draft Programme for Government’s outcomes and indicators. 
This is supported by various programmes such as the 
Tackling Paramilitarism Programme and ProblemSolving Justice – programmes to address paramilitarism, criminality and organised crime; and reducing crime by changing behaviours.
Activity snapshot:
The NI Open Government Network helps deliver more open, transparent and accountable government by empowering citizens to shape decisions that impact on their lives. The Network has worked with the Northern Ireland government to develop open government commitments for inclusion in the United Kingdom Open Government Action Plan.
Problem-Solving Justice (PSJ) is a new strategy which adopts a holistic and joined-up approach to dealing with and changing behaviour for the better. Its aim is to address the specific problems of individual offenders and move them onto a different life trajectory. A portfolio of PSJ pilots, including Substance Misuse Courts and Enhanced Combination Orders are at various stages of development.
Community relations programmes in Northern Ireland also aim to improve both intra and inter community relations, create new shared and inclusive spaces, promote diversity, inclusion, tolerance, peace, reconciliation and appreciation of different cultures and traditions.
The Tackling Paramilitarism Programme is a series of commitments from the Northern Ireland Executive aimed at tackling paramilitarism, criminality and organised crime. It involves government departments, law enforcement agencies, local councils and community and voluntary sector partners working together. The focus is on robust law enforcement, implementing long term preventions measures, addressing social issues that affect communities and building confidence in the justice system.
UK action around the world 
Violence is one of the biggest obstacles to achieving the 2030 Agenda; more than 80% of the world’s poorest will be living in countries affected by violence and conflict by 2030.520 The UK has long supported progress around the world towards more peaceful, just and inclusive societies, and continues to promote human rights internationally while meeting obligations at home as outlined above. To support further action the UK will co-host Goal 16 at the High-Level Political Forum in 2019.
Peace and security for all (16.1, 16.2, 16.3 16.4)
The UK is committed to tackling the causes of conflict, and tackling insecurity and instability is central to the UK’s international work to support Goal 16. In 2016, 57% of the UK’s international development department’s budget was spent in fragile states affected by conflict.521
At the UN, the UK plays an active role in delivering commitments on inclusion, access, equality and rights as the common underpinnings for sustainable development and sustaining peace. In 2015, the UK kept the international spotlight on the Rohingya crisis in Burma, actively supporting UN-led efforts to find a political solution and is pursuing a peaceful end to conflict in Yemen, Syria, Libya and Somalia.
Activity snapshot:
Through the Conflict Security and Stability 
Fund (CSSF), including funding for a UN Trust Fund, the UK is supporting implementation of the peace agreement in Colombia. UK support is strengthening security and justice, creating socio-economic opportunities and promoting reconciliation through support for the Special Jurisdiction for Peace and victim groups engaging with the Truth Commission.
The UK fully endorses the UN Secretary General’s Sustaining Peace reforms to improve the UN’s ability to prevent conflicts and contribute to stability. In 2018, the UK doubled its contribution to the UN Peacebuilding Fund to £32 million (to 2020), to help prevent conflicts. It also launched a National Action Plan for Women, Peace and Security which puts women and girls at the heart of the UK’s work to prevent and resolve conflict, recognising the important link to Goal 5.
Activity snapshot:
Building Sustainable Peacetime Economies in the Aftermath of War, brings together an international research consortium led by the School of Oriental and African Studies. It  will develop metrics on human rights, security  and development that will provide more information about the impacts of drugs. It aims to benefit policy makers seeking to support sustainable and more inclusive war to peace transitions, by providing evidence about ‘what works’ in addressing illicit economies and promoting peacebuilding in fragile states and borderland regions. 
To tackle child sexual abuse and exploitation and child trafficking, in addition to the Prime Minister’s global Call to Action to End Forced Labour, Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking (see Goal 8) the UK has increased co-operation with international partners. The UK is a founding Board member of the Global Partnership to End Violence Against Children, and through this landmark movement is driving the consensus for change to protect children from all forms of violence, abuse and exploitation. Since 2015, the UK has driven and funded the WePROTECT Global Alliance. This brings together the influence, expertise and resources required to transform how online child sexual exploitation is dealt with so that it can be better addressed. By 2019/20, the UK will have invested £40 million to tackle online child sexual exploitation.
Activity snapshot
The UK is working with partners to combat international terrorism and crime. For example, the UK’s Crown Prosecution Service, through the CSSF, supported the creation of a Mutual Legal Assistance Agreement in Kenya allowing Kenyan authorities to share and receive evidence with international jurisdictions. This allowed evidence sharing to support two counter terrorism cases and the use of digital technology led to conviction in a child rape case in the UK.
Inclusion and respect for human rights (16.1, 16.a, 
16.b) 
Despite efforts, delivering the promise to Leave No One Behind remains a challenge on Goal 16. For example, people with disabilities still often face stigma and experience discrimination. In 2018, the UK increased funding to expand the reach of the Disability Catalyst Programme, which supports people with disabilities and disabled persons’ organisations to advocate for their rights. The 2018 Disability Summit demonstrated the UK’s leadership on disability inclusion and led to a set of ambitious commitments from governments and organisations to give people with disabilities greater rights. For more information about disability inclusion see Goal 10.
The UK is also a vocal champion for LGBT rights in international fora and its work overseas. UK Aid Connect, a new funding mechanism, includes a thematic area on LGBT inclusion. Through this, up to £12 million over four years will be available for a consortium of diverse organisations – civil society, think tanks and private sector – to work on LGBT inclusion overseas.
Accountable institutions (16.4, 16.5, 16.6, 16.7, 
16.8)
As a founding member of the Addis Tax Initiative, the UK is committed to working with developing countries to build capacity and robust tax systems. The UK continues to support better and more transparent management of public spending so that citizens can see where and how their taxes are being used (see Goal 17).
Activity snapshot:
The Trade and Investment Advocacy 
Fund helps developing countries take part in negotiations at the World Trade Organization supporting Global Target 16.8. It funds ACWL, an organisation that gives them equal access to legal advice. It is currently funding the accession of Sudan and helping Pacific Island Countries to participate in fisheries negotiations.
The UK is also leading the way in addressing corruption, bribery and illicit finance, having launched a Business Integrity Initiative to help UK companies respond cleanly to trade and investment opportunities in developing countries. In 2017, the UK established the International Corruption Coordination Centre 
and in 2018 campaigned on international beneficial ownership transparency. 
The UK government takes action against British companies and nationals who steal assets or pay bribes in developing countries and is making progress in implementing the International Action Against Corruption programme including, by funding a new global Open Ownership Register.522 Launched in April 2017, the Register is making information about company ownership globally accessible. 
Challenges and next steps 
Peace and security for all
With homicides and violence rising, reducing all forms of violence in the UK remains a challenge. Later this year, the UK will set out a serious violence strategy to include further measures to support law enforcement, multi-agency working and early intervention and prevention. 
Another priority is safety and security in UK prisons, to reduce levels of violence, and reform the youth secure estate.523
The duty to ensure everyone has a right to feel safe also extends to those in custody. There were too many assaults by prisoners in 2018 (34,223, up 16% from 2017), too many incidents of self-harm (55,598, up 
25% from 2017) and too many self-inflicted deaths (87, up 19% from 2017).524 To address this, investment in prison staff in England and Wales has increased – between October 2016 and March 2019, the number of prison officers went from 17,955 to 22,630, an increase of 4,675 officers.525
In Northern Ireland, an integrated Care and Justice Campus comprising the current Secure Care and Juvenile Justice Centres will be established by 2020. The Campus will be able to provide short-term safe spaces through to longer-term, high intensity, therapeutic support for children with serious mental health and substance misuse problems. It is envisaged that this programme will result in services which focus on the needs of young people; work to improve opportunities and outcomes; prevent repeat admissions to secure care; and divert young people from the justice system. 
Internationally, the underlying causes of insecurity and instability are being identified and tackled through the UK’s development assistance. The UK will work with the UN and Global Counter Terrorism Forum to build institutions in partner countries through coordinated capacity building. Efforts will focus on new work to reduce illicit financial flows and improve global financial systems. The UK is scaling up engagement with global and regional financial centres to reduce illicit flows from developing countries. 
At home, the UK’s Commission for Countering Extremism (CCE) has been established to support society in fighting all forms of terrorism. CCE will shortly publish a study into the threats of extremism, and the current response.
Wales is legislating to improve openness, transparency and accountability in local government in Wales, including providing for the webcasting of council meetings, better public access and the electronic publication of key statements and documents to support Goal 16.
The Scottish Government is establishing a Citizens’ Assembly to bring together a cross section of Scottish society under an independent Convenor to address the change Scotland needs in a way that aims to build agreement, to debate choices respectfully and in a way that seeks maximum areas of agreement. The Scottish Government has committed to incorporating the principles of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) into domestic law. The 
Scottish Parliament is currently considering a Children (Equal Protection from Assault) (Scotland) Bill, which would contribute to ending all forms of violence against children.
Inclusion and respect for human rights
The UK is also strengthening its approach to online child sexual exploitation and abuse with an online harms strategy to ensure that the system protects vulnerable people, supports victims and brings perpetrators to justice. 
Despite the fall in hate crime, the UK is not complacent. Challenges include continued underreporting, high rates of attrition in the criminal justice system and targeted abuse online. The Hate Crime Action plan will continue to run to 2020. 
The UK has committed to improve the police response to LGBT hate crime; raise awareness of support; address domestic abuse of LGBT people with complex needs; bring forward proposals to end the practice of conversion therapy; ensure transgender prisoners are treated fairly; and improve access to justice for LGBT people as set out in the LGBT Action Plan. The UK has also committed to drive positive and practical conversations on LGBT equality in the Commonwealth. 
In Northern Ireland, the Executive Office in conjunction with delivery partners are constantly working to identify gaps in funding provision and issues affecting the uptake of good relations programmes, to ensure need is targeted to where appropriate and addresses the challenges of reducing hate crime.
Online offending is just as serious as off-line offending. In 2018, there were 976,000 computer misuse offences experienced by the public.526 This figure is a decrease on 2017 levels but there is still more to be done. Robust legislation will set out how a range of online harms will be tackled, including hate crime, with clear responsibilities for tech companies to keep UK citizens safe. 
In Wales, in response to calls from a wide range of stakeholders, including the Equality and Human Rights Commission, for the Welsh Government to do more to be done more to safeguard equality and human rights, research will shortly be commissioned. This will to scope options to achieve such strengthening, including consideration of incorporating UN conventions and treaties into Welsh law, as well as stronger regulation, guidance and monitoring under existing legislation. The work, which will be overseen by a stakeholder working group, and will take account of a new commitment by the Welsh Government to enact the socio-economic duty in Part one of the Equality Act 2010.
From January 2020, Wales will provide £8.04 million funding to support social welfare advice services in its third, private and statutory sectors. The services will provide integrated advice to individuals on any social welfare problems they face, and on early intervention and crisis resolution. They will embed capabilitybuilding work to ensure that individuals are better placed to deal with similar problems in the future. 
Finally, the UK is committed to the promotion of media freedom and the protection of journalists and will host an international conference on media freedom in July 2019. ARTICLE 19 is leading the PROTECT programme to pilot responses to shrinking civic space, the pressure on independent media and civil society and the data, transparency and accountability failures in increasingly digital environments, with a focus on Burma, Kenya and Malawi.

Goal 17: Partnership for the Goals
Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalise the global partnership for sustainable development
Summary 
Partnerships are at the heart of delivering the 2030 Agenda and the Goals. The Goals can only be realised if sufficient resources are mobilised and correctly invested, if the capacity of governments is improved and global systems operate effectively, and if more partners feel empowered to contribute.
The UK government is playing a leading role. In 2013, the UK was the first G20 country to meet the UN target to allocate 0.7% of gross national income (GNI) to Official Development Assistance (ODA) and has continued to hit this target year on year since.527 Moreover, the UK has consistently sought to meet the highest standards of aid effectiveness, transparency, results and value for money. These ambitions have been set out in the Aid Reviews, Civil Society Partnership Review (2016), Economic Development Strategy (2017) for international development, and its Transparency Agenda – Open Aid, Open Societies (2018). 
The UK is deepening relationships and collaborating with partners to address evolving challenges. The UK public more broadly is also contributing to achieve the Goals domestically and internationally: people are generously donating their money and their time to the causes they care about and initiatives such as UK Aid Match and employer-supported volunteering. 
This chapter sets out the UK’s approach to mobilising finance and strengthening the partnerships needed to deliver on the Goals – not only mobilising ODA, but also domestic resources, private finance and remittances. The chapter also sets out UK efforts to maximise the contribution to sustainable development of trade, science and technology; capacity-building; and systemic issues.
Leave No One Behind examples:
• The Data Disaggregation Action Plan (2017) for international development was launched by the UK National Statistician at the World Data Forum in 2017. The action plan set out the initial practical steps that the UK will take to move the 2030 Agenda forward, focussing on four key areas of disaggregation: sex, age, disability status and geography. The UK has delivered a Data Disaggregation Resource Library, sharing and showcasing early learning from partners in collecting and using disaggregated data, and demonstrating not only the technical aspects of gathering data but also how this informs decision making.
• Scotland’s Climate Justice Innovation Fund was launched in June 2017 to support projects developing innovative solutions for strengthening African communities against the effects of climate change.
• The Wales for Africa programme supports people in Wales to take action on poverty in Africa by  funding and building projects that support learning, the exchange of skills, joint working and tackling climate change.

UK Action
Finance (17.1, 17.2, 17.3, 17.4, 17.5)
The UK is one of the largest providers of ODA in the world and has committed to keep aid untied. It committed to invest 0.7% of GNI on ODA from 
2013, and the International Development (Official 
Development Assistance Target) Act enshrined this in UK law from 2015. In the calendar year 2017, the UK provided £14.1 billion of ODA.528
However, the level of ambition set out in the 2030 Agenda means there is an estimated investment gap of US$2.5 trillion per year for developing countries to deliver the Goals.529 The UK played a significant role in shaping the 2015 Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) which provides the global framework for financing sustainable development and bridging this gap. Donor countries recommitted to achieving the UN spending targets on ODA. Moreover, governments made a historic agreement to look at wider sources of finance to fund the Goals and called for more highquality global data and better monitoring. The UK has responded by pressing the international system to better coordinate its support for data, providing statistical capacity-building at country level and supporting the development of the TOSSD (Total Official Support for Sustainable Development) metric, which will track resources invested in the Goals. Domestic Resource Mobilisation 
Countries require the capacity to raise revenues and direct these towards domestic policies that will achieve the Goals. Within the UK, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) policies aim to maximise the collection of the tax and duties that are legally due and bear down on tax avoidance and evasion. In 2017/18, £605.8 billion was generated for UK public services and other priorities – a 13% increase compared to levels in 2015/16 (nominal terms).530 Every year, through the UK’s compliance work, billions of pounds are collected or protected that would have otherwise been lost to the UK through fraud, tax avoidance, evasion and non-compliance. In 2017/18, the UK generated £30.3 billion in compliance yield; 5% higher than the previous year.531
The Data Picture: UK ODA to LDCs
Coverage: UK
Global Indicator 17.2.1 shows that the UK meets the global ambition to spend 0.7% of its gross national income (GNI) on Official Development Assistance (ODA) and 0.2% of its GNI on Least Developed Countries (LDCs). UK ODA has been increasing year on year since 2008, in 2017 ODA increased by 15.9% compared to 2015 (Chart A). However, spend received by LDCs has stayed fairly stable, which means that the overall proportion of total ODA to LDCs has been declining slowly (Chart B). This is due to funds to Low and MiddleIncome Countries such as Syria increasing over the last five years.

Development
In tandem, the UK is using its expertise to support tax systems in developing countries and improve their tax-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratios. The UK’s approach is to support countries to raise their own revenues, in a way that finances public services, enables sustainable and inclusive growth and reduces poverty. The UK Tax Capacity Building Unit (CBU) provides peer-to-peer expertise including advisory support and mentoring. A Tax and Development resource centre is being developed to inform tax and development policy and programming.
The Data Picture: UK Tax Revenue
Coverage: UK
The Goals highlight the need to strengthen domestic resource mobilisation. The UK’s tax gap is the difference between the amount of tax that should, in theory, be paid to HMRC, and what is actually paid. This has been reducing since 2014/15 (6.0%), however in 2016/17 it still stood at 5.7% (£33 billion). In 2017, 75.3% of UK domestic budget was generated by UK taxes. This was broadly unchanged since 2000, with the proportion staying between 75% - 78% (Global Indicator 17.1.2)
UK Tax Gap: last five years of available data 
2012/13 to 2017/18
Source: HMRC, Annual report and accounts 
2017/18 (2018)
The UK has also encouraged other donor countries to do more. In 2015, the UK government co-launched the Addis Tax Initiative (ATI) to improve the transparency, fairness, effectiveness and efficiency of tax systems in partner countries. ATI members were asked to commit to collectively doubling technical cooperation by 2020 and supporting domestic resource mobilisation to improve development in line with the ATI’s key principles.
The UK continues to be a strong advocate on tax for development with partner governments, the G7,  the G20 and international organisations (OECD, International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank and UN).The UK helps to ensure developing countries are represented on an equal footing in international tax matters and can benefit from new international standards such as the OECD’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Inclusive Framework and the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes, both currently covering over 100 jurisdictions. 
Private finance 
When the AAAA was agreed, governments also acknowledged the critical need to attract private finance and direct investment to achieve the Goals. The UK government’s Department for International 
Development’s (DFID’s) Economic Development Strategy (2017) sets out how the UK government works with counterparts in developing countries to improve the enabling environments for the private sector. The Strategy also explains the direction being taken to encourage companies to seize new opportunities to provide goods and services in these markets and create jobs and income. 
Development Finance Institutions (DFIs), such as CDC Group plc, are playing an increasingly important role in supporting private sector development. When a DFI invests in a country, it increases the confidence of private sector investors who may have otherwise perceived the risk to their investment to be too high. As CDC’s sole shareholder, the UK government sets CDC’s investment policy – outlining which countries it should invest in, the standards it must comply with as a responsible investor and the financial return and development impact performance targets it must reach. This oversight enables the UK to direct investment to the hardest to reach and most fragile places. 
As one of the world’s largest capital markets and a global centre of financial expertise, the City of London is emerging as the key financial centre for the developing world. Through the UK’s strategic partnership with the City of London and other partners, developing countries can borrow on London’s capital market in their own currencies, free of the risk of currency fluctuation.
Remittances 
Remittances are another important resource flowing to developing countries. In 2017 alone, US$9.7 billion in remittances was sent from the UK.532 Personal remittances received by the UK accounted for 0.17% of GDP in 2017, broadly unchanged since 2015.533
The Data Picture: UK Imports 
(including services) from Developing 
Countries
Coverage: UK
The Goals highlight a need to increase developing countries’ exports. In 2018, 17.9% of UK imports were from developing countries (Global Indicator 17.11.1). This is broadly unchanged from levels seen in 2015 (18.1%). Developing countries have been defined in line with the ODA eligible country list produced by the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC).

Debt
Debt and debt service levels remain a challenge to financing the Goals in some contexts. They have risen across a wide range of emerging market economies and low-income developing countries for reasons such as adverse shocks (falling commodity prices, exchange rate fluctuations and civil conflict), looser fiscal policies, and in some cases fraud and corruption. Debt sustainability is ultimately the responsibility of sovereign nations, but many countries need support to build the capacity to manage debt well. The UK has committed to contribute £4 million to the World Bank-IMF Debt Management Facility, which provides tools that help countries assess and plan their debt. The UK is also a leading voice in calling for the World Bank and IMF to tackle debt vulnerabilities and supports the programme of work that was launched in 2018. The UK strongly advocates for increased debt transparency from both borrowers and creditors and works through the G20 on sharing best practice amongst creditors, including emerging creditors such as China, India and Saudi Arabia. In a similar vein, the UK supports the work of the Institute for International Finance to develop guidelines for the private sector.
Trade (17.10, 17.11, 17.12)
Trade is critical to a country’s economic growth and its ability to finance its development. The UK supports a stable global trade regime that is governed by common rules and frameworks for resolving disputes and which takes due consideration of the concerns of developing countries when new global rules are adopted. The UK is a strong advocate for the effective functioning of the World Trade Organization (WTO) to achieve these objectives.
The UK government is a large provider of Aid for Trade, spending £1.5 billion of ODA in 2017, according to the latest OECD figures.534 Aid for Trade programmes support the integration of developing countries - particularly the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) - into the WTO multilateral trading system. The UK offers enhanced market access for developing countries and assistance to take advantage of this access. For example, the UK’s government’s Department for International Trade is supporting two-way trade and investment between the UK and countries across Africa. 
In the Trade White Paper (October 2017), the UK government announced its intention to put in place a trade preferences scheme by granting duty-free, quotafree access to 48 LDCs and by granting generous tariff reductions to around 25 other developing countries. The Taxation (Cross-Border Trade) Act 2018 enshrines the commitment into UK legislation. Science and technology (17.6, 17.7, 17.8)
Technology is producing income-generating opportunities helping to drive economic growth that creates resources for development. Science and technology can also offer ideas and potential solutions towards achieving the Goals.
UK ODA that is being spent on research, technology and innovation to deliver development benefits has been increasing since 2015 and a whole-ofgovernment approach is being taken to maximise the impact of investment. Funds535 have been established to prioritise collaboration with global research organisations, the development of north-south partnerships, and the use of southern partners where possible to manage local capacity development and strengthen institutional capacity. UK-funded research has helped reduce under-5 mortality in Africa,536 developed more productive and nutritious crops to feed growing populations,537 and resulted in a strengthened arsenal of interventions to tackling infectious diseases such as Ebola and malaria. 
Activity snapshot:
The mobile operators’ network, GSMA, operates the Mobile for Development (M4D) Utilities Programme – partly supported by DFID – which in Niger is supporting a startup called CityTaps to extend access to safely managed drinking water. CityTaps developed a water utility subscriber management solution, including a smart prepaid water meter. This allows households to make micro-prepayments for their water at any time using mobile money and provides a software management system and management dashboard to monitor usage and performance of the meters remotely. 88% of surveyed users felt that their water spending had decreased since the project began. 90% of women using the service felt that they spent less time obtaining water. Building on the project funded by the GSMA M4D Utilities Innovation Fund, CityTaps plans to reach 200,000 people by the end of 2019 and more than two million by the end of 2022. 
The UK also promotes the development, transfer, and dissemination of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries. 
There are a series of Innovation Partnerships between the UK and Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa who have growing tech sectors. The UK Innovation Partnerships team includes expertise from across UK government 538 – providing a ‘one stop shop’ of excellence and tailored support. They will support the pairing of entrepreneurs, businesses, venture capital, and universities with African counterparts, helping to equip the next generation with the digital skills to succeed.
In view of the increasing role that digital technologies are playing globally, the UK government has launched a Digital Strategy (2018-2020) on ‘doing development in a digital world’. This set out ambitious plans to: embed good practice in using digital solutions in aid programmes; and ensure that the benefits of digital technologies are accessible to all. 
Capacity-building (17.9)
The UK recognises South-South Cooperation (SSC) and Triangular Cooperation as important tools to achieve the Goals and renewed its commitment to the Buenos Aires Plan of Action at the 2019 UN High Level Conference on SSC. 
The UK is deepening relationships with rising powers such as India and China who are providing increasing levels of aid. 
Many developing countries are now more interested in technical assistance, investment mobilisation and partnership rather than traditional grant financing. Programmes have, therefore, been established to facilitate and improve peer-to-peer development partnerships between UK institutions and counterpart institutions in developing countries. For example, the Partnerships for Development programme is funding the British Geological Survey to build capacity to manage geological data in four countries.
Systemic issues
The UK supports a strong and resilient international system within which relationships between states and institutions are based on rules and agreements. The UK uses its membership of the UN and economic, legal and security institutions to drive policies and reforms that support sustainable development. 
The UK also works closely with regional bodies. There is an enduring partnership with the Commonwealth in particular, which is a voluntary association of 53 independent and equal sovereign states. In April 2018, the UK hosted the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) which agreed a range of actions to build a Commonwealth that is fairer, more sustainable, more prosperous, and more secure. Examples include, amongst others, the Marine Plastics 
Research and Innovation Framework initiative (also Goal 14) and the Commonwealth Connectivity Agenda for Trade and Investment.
Policy and institutional coherence (17.13, 17.14, 17.15) 
The Goals highlight the relationships between policy areas. This challenges governments to ensure that there is a whole-of-government approach to deliver the Goals. Every UK government department has a Single Departmental Plan that sets its their priorities and how it will contribute to cross-governmental commitments such as the Goals. The plans enable progress against the Goals to be reported publicly in Departments’ Annual Report and Accounts and enable progress to 
be scrutinised by parliament and the public. Single Departmental Plans are available on GOV.UK. 
Coherence in policy-making at the national and international levels is also important. Macroeconomic stability – a prerequisite for sustainable development – requires coherent policy-making on issues such as finance, investment and trade at both the national and the international level. The UK contributes to shaping International Monetary Fund (IMF) policy, including on preventative and remedial IMF activities to maintain macroeconomic stability. The UK also provides substantial funding, including for technical assistance, to countries to improve their implementation of fiscal, monetary and financial policies.
Data, monitoring and accountability (17.18, 17.19)
Quality and timely data are vital for enabling all to make informed decisions on how best to direct resources to deliver the Goals, to monitor progress, and to drive accountability. The UK is a strong advocate and funder of the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data (GPSDD), which is a network of organisations dedicated to using the data revolution to achieve the Goals. GPSDD has developed the Inclusive Data Charter (2018) to mobilise political support for disaggregated data in order to realise the commitment to Leave No One Behind, which the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the UK’s statistical authority, and DFID have signed up to. 
In the UK, the ONS – the UK’s statistics agency – is responsible for reporting UK data for the global indicators to the UN. As of June 2019, the ONS was reporting UK data for 74% of the 244 Global Indicators (180 Global Indicators).539 The ONS is collecting age, sex, disability status, ethnicity, income, geography and migratory status for indicators where possible. As of June 2019, over 70% of these 180 indicators have data for at least one disaggregation. 
The ONS has a strong international reputation and shares its expertise and builds strategic partnerships with institutions in developing countries. Activities include assistance on the modernisation of official statistics, development of quality assurance frameworks and data interoperability.
The UK also supports statistical capacity building in developing countries through other channels including the World Bank’s Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity Building and PARIS 21. This has assisted over 40 countries to produce national plans for the development of statistics and supported implementation. Other data initiatives include a programme to strengthen agricultural statistics across a range of countries and a geospatial programme aiming to improve population estimates. The UK also provides direct support to national statistical priorities which would otherwise not be fully funded, for example supporting twelve censuses and two population estimation exercises in the previous census round. Multi-stakeholder partnership (17.16, 17.17)
An open and vibrant civil society is a fundamental partner in direct delivery and in the promotion of inclusive societies and accountability. DFID’s Civil Society Partnership Review (2016) reiterated the unique contribution of the sector internationally and set out an approach to working with civil society organisations that boosts the effectiveness of these partnerships. The private sector is another essential partner. The chapter “Delivering the Goals through shared endeavour” provides detail on how different partners are engaging and where the UK government is supporting them. 
Beyond partnerships with individual sectors, the UK is using its convening power to develop comprehensive alliances that draw together different capabilities. During the Global Disability Summit in 2018, the UK brought together a range of leaders committed to driving a step-change in access to assistive technologies. The Assistive Technology (AT) Scale Global Partnership was established between DFID, USAID, WHO, UNICEF, Clinton Health Access Initiative, the Office of the UN Special Envoy for Health, the Government of Kenya, the China Disabled People’s Federation and the Global Disability Innovation Hub. 
This aims to enable half a billion more people to access AT by 2030. In support of this new partnership, a new programme, AT2030, will catalyse new technologies and service delivery models, spark at least 50 new startups and mobilise the private sector to reach at least 9 million people with AT by 2030.
Another example is the ‘Centre for Disaster Protection’, established in the City of London in 2018 in partnership with the World Bank. Through this initiative the UK works closely with the private sector to reduce the impacts of natural disasters and speed up resilient recovery. The Centre sources ideas, tools and approaches and in turn provides technical advice and support to developing partner governments to strengthen their financial risk management for disasters. This support helps them to use tools like insurance to access rapid, reliable finance in emergencies.
Devolution
Under the UK’s devolution settlement, international relations remain the responsibility of the UK government and the UK Parliament. However, the UK government recognises that the devolved administrations will have an interest in international policy-making in relation to devolved matters. In the case of international development, the devolved administrations may allocate funds from their budgets to international development projects. Where such spending meets the definition of ODA set by the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC), it counts towards overall UK ODA spending.
Scotland
Although the majority of targets in this Goal relate to UK-wide action, international development is a key part of Scotland’s global contribution within the international community. In 2016, following a public consultation, the Scottish Government published Global Citizenship: Scotland’s International Development Strategy, which sets out Scotland’s contribution to the international community and is specifically designed to align with the Goals. The strategy is focussed on four partner countries: Malawi, Rwanda, Zambia and Pakistan; and has an International Development Fund to support and empower those four partner countries. 
Activity snapshot:
Scotland’s Sustainable Development Goals Network is a growing coalition of over 300 people and organisations from across Scotland committed to making sure that the Goals become every Scot’s business.
Key to the Scottish Government’s approach to international development is the concept that Scotland can be a global leader in international development, providing ethical leadership on issues such as climate change. Being a global leader is not necessarily just about size in absolute monetary terms, but the impact that can be made across government policy and through wider involvement. Therefore, increasingly, the Scottish Government is focussing its international development work through the lens of the commitment to the “Beyond Aid” agenda: to do no harm, taking a stepwise approach to eliminate policy incoherence that would detract from Scotland’s international development goals or efforts; and going further, identifying policies beyond international development policy that can contribute positively to development outcomes.
The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA) plays a role in international networks working on sustainable develpoment, in support of this Goal.
Systemic issues: Policy coherence, partnership and measuring progress (17.13, 17.14, 17.15, 17.16, 
17.17, 17.18, 17.19) 
The National Performance Framework (NPF), Scotland’s way of localising the Goals, was refreshed in 2018 following extensive consultation. This refresh put increased well-being alongside sustainable and inclusive economic growth. It is a holistic framework encouraging policy coherence across the National Outcomes and related Goals. It is also underpinned in law as being for all of Scotland and not only government. This approach provides a common framework and focus for people and organisations to work together to improve the lives of people in Scotland. The measurement attached to the framework encompasses a range of social, economic and environmental indications. Scotland’s Open Government Action Plan 2018-20 contains complementary commitments on financial transparency and improving the way people can understand, participate in and influence the work of government. Scotland used its first Open Government Action Plan to support the alignment of National Outcomes and the Goals.
Wales
The Welsh Government’s new international strategy will aim to present Wales to the world as a ‘Creative Next Generation Nation’. The International Strategy will be founded on a clear set of values which will help to present Wales’s face internationally – including a commitment to sustainability and future generations, the promotion of the principles of Fair Work and a fundamental belief in the fact that Wales will achieve more to tackle some of the major challenges of modern age - digital technology, tackling poverty and inequality, taking on environmental challenges and climate change, through working together across territorial boundaries. The Welsh Government’s strategy will include a focus on promoting Wales’s global responsibilities through the Wales for Africa programme and by demonstrating Wales’s approach to global citizenship. 
Trade (17.10, 17.11, 17.12) 
Wales is an outward-facing, globally-trading nation that believes in promoting and protecting Wales’s place in the world, recognising Wales’s responsibilities on the world stage and promoting fair and ethical trade. Science and Technology (17.6, 17.7, 17.8) 
The new Tertiary Education and Research Commission brings together all Welsh Government controlled research funding to reflect Welsh priorities and link research, innovation, skills development and teaching. The Life Sciences Hub is being refocussed to accelerate change, creating value across the Welsh health and care system and make it easier for partnerships to develop and thrive. In 2018, Wales’s first dedicated science park was opened. Menai Science Park within the Anglesey Enterprise Zone brings together businesses from the ICT, science and research sectors. 
Activity snapshot:
University of Wales St Davids has formed a pan-Wales partnership with four further education colleges, the Building Research Establishment (BRE) and Tidal Lagoon Swansea Bay to deliver coherent, seamless provision throughout Wales of specialist and bespoke training from levels 1-7. The Innovation Nation publication from the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales presents a collection of case studies that highlights the value to the Welsh economy of innovation activity in Wales’s universities.
Capacity-building (17.9) 
The Wales for Africa Grant Scheme is a flagship initiative of the Welsh Government’s Wales for Africa programme. The scheme enables community groups and organisations in Wales to access funding for smallscale projects that contribute to Wales’s delivery of the Goals and deliver benefits to Wales and Africa. The programme supports people in Wales to take action on poverty in Africa. 
Systemic issues (17.13, 17.14, 17.15, 17.16, 17.17, 
17.18, 17.19) 
Policy and institutional coherence 
In Wales, the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 provides a robust and legal framework for policy coherence on sustainable development. It brings in key institutions in Wales (the public bodies under the Act), changes existing institutions (such as the Auditor General for Wales), and creates new institutions for the future – the statutory Future Generations Commissioner for Wales. 
Multi-stakeholder partnerships 
The Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 
2015 promotes partnership working by making ‘collaboration’ and involvement two of five ways of working in a sustainable way (the sustainable development principle) which public bodies are under a duty to consider; and secondly, by establishing statutory partnerships covering every local community in Wales. These Public Services Boards (PSBs) improve joint working across all public services and are legally bound to consider sustainable development.
Wales also has in place partnerships with the third sector, local authorities and businesses and many of these partnerships are actively taking action under the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015. 
The Mutual Investment Model (MIM) has been developed to finance major capital projects. The MIM will support additional investment in social and economic infrastructure projects and private partners will be required to adopt the Code of Practice Ethical Employment in Supply Chains and establish high levels of environmental sustainability. Since the launch of the MIM, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) has taken a strong interest in the model.
Wales’s membership of the Regions 4 Sustainable Development network has allowed it to mobilise and share knowledge of its experience. Wales was featured in the ‘Localizing the SDGs’ report which was prepared for the UN High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development in 2018. Sophie Howe, the first Future Generations Commissioner for Wales is also the current chair of the International Network of Institutions for Future Generations. 
Activity snapshot:
The South Wales – Sierra Leone Cancer Care Link is a partnership between health professionals from three Welsh Health Boards and the Ministry of Health and several hospitals in Sierra Leone. This partnership established the first cancer care registry in Sierra Leone, and doctors from both countries learn from each other through sharing on patient cases and treatment.
Data, monitoring and accountability 
All statistics from the Welsh Government follow the standards defined by the UK Statistics Authority. The Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015, has established forty-four national well-being indicators to measure progress in achieving the seven well-being goals for Wales. This work is led by the Chief Statistician for Wales. This work has included a mapping exercise to link the Global Targets and Indicators to Wales’s well-being goals through an online interactive application. 
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland, the principles of sustainable development are embedded in the Northern Ireland Executive’s draft Programme for Government. Following the suspension of the Northern Ireland Executive in March 2017, the draft Programme for Government framework has been used as the basis for the Northern Ireland Civil Service Outcomes Delivery Plan. 
A mapping exercise has been carried out to highlight how the Outcomes Delivery Plan 2018 - 19 aligns with the Goals. The monitoring arrangements for the Programme for Government will show how Northern Ireland is progressing towards the Goals.
Challenges and next steps
The UK will be a strong proponent of global cooperation and will continue to protect the rules and reforms that are required for the achievement of the Goals. The UK will continue to exercise its strong voice in international organisations cited throughout this Voluntary National Review such as the UN, WTO, OECD, and the IMF, and call for due consideration of developing countries.
The UK will also continue to develop and strengthen multi-stakeholder partnerships to tackle specific goals and targets. For example, the UK will host a UK-Africa Investment Summit in 2020 to mobilise the private sector to drive job creation and transformational growth in African markets through increased trade and investment. The UK will also host a major international conference in mid-2020 to raise funds for life-saving vaccinations for some of the world’s poorest children. The pledging conference will support the global vaccination body Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which since 2000 has vaccinated 700 million children in the world’s poorest nations, preventing 10 million deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases like measles, whooping cough and pneumonia.540
No one organisation, including national governments or local authorities, can achieve the Goals alone. Scotland has a good partnership infrastructure in place, nurtured by the approach of the NPF. The Welsh Government’s new international strategy will be founded on a clear set of values – including a commitment to sustainability and future generations and a fundamental belief in the fact that more will be achieved through working together across territorial boundaries. Through the Wellbeing of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015, Wales has put collaboration as a statutory way of working under the sustainable development principle. The Welsh Government will also strengthen its involvement of stakeholders in the implementation of Agenda 2030 and the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 through a re-invigorated forum to drive forward the next chapter of Wales’s sustainable development journey. But there is more that can be done to work across boundaries to make a positive difference and engage more people and organisations, including business, in delivering the 2030 Agenda.
A continuing challenge is sourcing more disaggregated data, particularly for groups that are at risk of being left behind. Training is a very important ingredient of truly inclusive surveys. DFID’s Data Disaggregation Action Plan is a living document and as such will be monitored, reviewed, refreshed and updated every two years in advance of the World Data Forums. The UK will invite feedback from partners to help collectively better address the challenges of inclusive data. The UK will also work with others to assess the individual and collective impact of these Inclusive Data Charter Action Plans over the coming years.  

Conclusions and next steps
Conclusions and next steps
The UK is committed to implementing the Goals and the 2030 Agenda at home and around the world. 
Conducting the UK’s first Voluntary National Review has yielded many lessons and insights. Hundreds of stakeholders from across the UK have been engaged, whether by submitting case studies, attending stakeholder engagement events or providing feedback electronically. 
While the Voluntary National Review identifies many reasons to be proud, it also outlines key areas where further action is required and the steps being taken, with a clear emphasis on Leave No One Behind. This is done throughout the report with each of the Goal-specific chapters setting out key challenges and identifying clear and actionable next steps that will inform continued UK efforts.
The Voluntary National Review is not an end in itself, but a stepping stone on the journey to 2030. In addition to Goal-specific actions, there are a number  of overarching themes that the UK will continue to focus on, including collaboration, data and financing for the Goals.
Collaboration and innovation to drive progress
The 2030 Agenda is about universal action, with governments, businesses, civil society, and individuals all doing their bit. The UK’s Voluntary National Review makes clear the importance of collective action across the UK to fix foundations, act strategically, plan for, and adapt to a rapidly changing future. Continual innovation is needed to maximise opportunities, working collectively and collaboratively.
The UK government’s planning and performance framework will continue to be refined to increase the level of detail on reporting of government activity in relation to the Goals. 
The UK government will review and further strengthen the existing means and mechanisms to oversee its contribution to domestic delivery of the Goals, building on the Single Departmental Plan process. This review will take place as a matter of priority and will examine both official and ministerial level structures. Given the importance of partnership and cross-sector collaboration, an effective mechanism will also be established to enhance stakeholder engagement and cooperation with government in the domestic sphere.
213
Relevant Ministerial and official groups, including those overseeing Official Development Assistance, will continue to support implementation of the Goals through the UK’s international work.
Internationally, the commitment to spend 0.7% of GNI on Official Development Assistance will continue to be used to support delivery of the Goals, in accordance with the UK Aid Strategy - addressing the root causes of extreme poverty by tackling conflict, building peace and security, and contributing to inclusive and sustainable economic growth. In line with this and the promise to Leave No One Behind, between 0.150.2% of GNI is targeted at Least Developed Countries. Relevant Ministerial and official groups, including those overseeing Official Development Assistance, will continue to support implementation of the Goals through the UK’s international work.
Data to empower change
Data which is timely, comprehensive and disaggregated is vital to continue to drive progress on the Goals and realise the promise to Leave No One Behind. While the UK has one of the largest and most developed statistical systems in the world, there is more work to do. The Inclusive Data Charter Action Plan of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) outlines plans for further improvements to data reporting. Key activities include:
• supplementing official data with new methods and sources, aiming to fill more data gaps using nongovernmental data;
• continuing to increase data disaggregation; and
• ensuring data developments are focussed on developing data capacity globally as well as domestically. For example, the UK will launch a hub of the ONS Data Science Campus (in partnership with the Department for International Development) that will have a focus on analysis of the Goals.
Boosting financing and investment for the Goals
While governments can help lay the building blocks for economic development and create enabling environments, those actions alone will not come close to addressing the US$2.5 trillion annual investment gap to deliver the Goals in the developing world. Two key areas of focus for the UK are harnessing the potential of UK financial services and institutional investors, including in the City of London, and maximising the opportunity that impact investing and responsible investing present. 

To attract greater participation by private finance in the Goals, UK government is working with key investors with strong experience in emerging and frontier markets. The aim is to design, test and - where appropriate - provide government support to investment products that allow savers and investors to support the Goals, while generating financial returns. Opportunities such as the UK’s hosting of the Africa Investment Summit in London in 2020 will be used to showcase this work.
In addition to working with investors, the UK government wants to find out more about the public’s interest in ethical, responsible, and impactful investment practices. People in the UK are among the most generous in the world;541 and previous research suggests nearly half of pension savers want to invest in line with their values.542 The Investing in a Better World project is working to build the evidence base on the level of customer demand for responsible and impact investment, and has conducted a nationally representative survey of what the public wants from their investments. The findings will be reported in late 2019.
Devolved administrations
Producing the Voluntary National Review has involved working closely with the devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland 
Scotland
The Voluntary National Review has been an opportunity to review and assess progress within the context of Scotland’s National Performance Framework (NPF). It has consolidated relationships with NPF delivery partners. The process has highlighted gaps, strengths, areas where more progress is needed, and it has sparked a discussion to drive further action. Given the amount of information generated, further detail and data is included in a Scottish Supplementary Review available at www.nationalperformance.gov.scot.
Wales
The Voluntary National Review has provided an opportunity to take stock of progress, building on the ongoing review mechanisms built into the Wellbeing of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015, including the annual Well-being of Wales 2017-18 report. It has highlighted where progress has been made and also areas of further work. It has also reengaged stakeholders and provided renewed appetite to bring together a stakeholder forum to support implementation. There is a commitment to explore this 

The UK’s Voluntary National Review 2019
further following the Review. Further detail on activity in Wales is included in a Welsh Supplementary Review available at www.gov.wales. In 2020, the Future Generations Commissioner for Wales will prepare a 
Future Generations Report and the Auditor General for Wales will also report on duties under the Act, both of which will be laid before the National Assembly for Wales.
Northern Ireland
The Voluntary National Review has generated closer collaborative working relationships in pursuit of the Goals. The recently developed Outcomes Delivery Plan sets out the actions to be taken to improve well-being for all - by tackling disadvantage and driving economic growth. While progress has been made in many areas, there is still much to do and many challenges to overcome. Achieving real and lasting success will take time as it involves tackling some of the biggest and most intractable problems facing society. The linkages established between the Outcomes Delivery Plan and the Goals, coupled with the insights gained from the Voluntary National Review, will provide direction and focus moving forward.
Conclusion 
Preparing for and conducting the UK’s first Voluntary National Review has further deepened the UK’s respect for and understanding of the Goals. The UK remains fully committed to continuing to strengthen and enhance efforts on the Goals, both domestically and internationally, generating continued concrete action to Leave No One Behind.
