EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
Pakistan committed to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development right from its inception, in 2015. In February 2016, it became the first country in the world to adopt the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as part of its national development agenda through a National Assembly Resolution. Learning from the experience of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), Pakistan’s national and provincial assemblies established SDG Taskforces to oversee progress on the goals.  
In fact, Pakistan started a conversation around the post-2015 Agenda as early as 2013, when nationwide consultations helped identify the priorities that were weaved into Pakistan’s national development perspective. These developments reflect Pakistan’s commitment to the SDGs. More recently, the 12th FiveYear Plan and provincial medium-term development strategies are all aligned with the 2030 Agenda. Pakistan is progressing on several fronts – such as reducing poverty and child stunting, improving transparency and accountability, and promoting gender equality and women’s empowerment. Pakistan’s political commitment to these priorities supports the 2030 Agenda.  
To improve vertical and horizontal coordination among different tiers of government and non-governmental stakeholders, seven SDG Support Units have been established at the federal, provincial and federally administered area levels. These units, guided by the federal Ministry of Planning, Development & Reform (MoPD&R) and provincial and administrative area Planning & Development Departments (P&DDs), have been instrumental in collating Pakistan’s first Voluntary National Review (VNR). The review process encompassed several comprehensive and inclusive stakeholder consultations, spread over months, focusing on seven predetermined themes. 
Pakistan has designed a comprehensive National SDG Framework which was approved by the National 
Economic Council (NEC), the country’s highest economic policy-making forum, in March 2018. This Framework sets baselines and targets for SDG indicators and will feed into the SDGs’ Monitoring and Evaluation Framework. The framework is now guiding the provinces and federally administered areas to determine their development priorities, based on local needs.  
To bolster the implementation of the SDGs, the provinces have instituted Technical Committees and Thematic Clusters. The nomination of focal persons at all levels of government, down to the districts, is helping them to align their development priorities with the 2030 Agenda. This institutional arrangement has been instrumental in guiding the alignment of federal and provincial national policies, sectoral plans and growth strategies with the contours of the 2030 Agenda.  
National data collection tools have been modified to improve data availability, with a focus on the inclusivity, equity and sustainability aspects of the SDGs. Transparency will be a major hallmark of monitoring and evaluation architecture. Pakistan completed its analysis of data gaps related to the SDGs as a stepping stone for monitoring and reporting progress.  
Complementing these institutional reforms are several advocacy and awareness interventions across the country. Starting from the Local Government Summit in 2017, several events have been arranged to raise awareness among grassroots level public officials and parliamentarians, to prioritize the SDGs in legislative business in response to local needs. Civil society and academia are fully supportive of the Government in terms of achieving these targets. Pakistan is also working to implement the inclusive nature of the 2030 Agenda by developing communication platforms that cater to our cultural, linguistic and geographic diversity, to ensure that ‘no one is left behind’. Since 2016, several policies and laws have been approved and promulgated. The greatest number of legislative frameworks relate to SDG 16 (‘Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions’), SDG 8 (‘Decent Work and Economic Growth’) and SDG 4 (‘Quality Education’).  
Commitment to poverty alleviation remains a key focus. Through Pakistan’s multi-sectoral poverty reduction strategy and targeted interventions, progress has been made despite persistent challenges. Over the past ten years, the poverty headcount has fallen by 26 percentage points and multi-dimensional poverty by 16 percentage points. The national poverty alleviation programme, Ehsaas (compassion), was launched in 2019 to expand social protection, safety nets and support human capital development throughout the country. This programme complements and expands the on-going, robust social protection programme for poor women. As the national resolve to eliminate poverty is firm, the size of assistance for the lowest strata has been enhanced. The National Socioeconomic Registry is being updated to target the poorest more effectively and to ensure that no one is left behind.  
Stunting and malnutrition have decreased between 2013 and 2018 by 6 and 9 percentage points, respectively. Recognizing persistent nutrition challenges, a greater focus is being placed on these issues, underpinned by the allocation of resources. The prevalence of skilled birth attendance has improved by 17 percentage points while the neonatal mortality rate has fallen by 10 percentage points during the same period. The Lady Health Workers Programme, with its grassroots presence, has been instrumental in achieving these improvements. A new universal health coverage initiative, the Sehat Sahulat Programme, was launched in 2019 to provide health insurance coverage for those in need. Health sector reforms are underway, entailing a centralized integrated disease surveillance system and a strong inter-provincial information sharing mechanism. Improving access to, and the quality of, education is a key national priority for Pakistan. Its focus is on improved school monitoring mechanisms, along with targeted interventions for out-of-school children. While the female literacy remains low, rising gross enrolment figures for girls’ education show that Pakistan is on track to eliminate gender disparities in education. The results of promoting women’s empowerment through education are being felt in other sectors, as women’s labour force participation increases, unemployment among young women decreases, and a rising share of senior and middle management and professional positions are held by women. 
Measures to improve water and sanitation are guided by the National Sanitation Policy 2006, and the National Water Policy 2018. Data reveals progress in these areas. The Government has also increased access to electricity by 8 percentage points in the past ten years. The proportion of the population who rely on clean fuels has risen by 11 percentage points1 in the same period. This has a range of positive implications for health and environmental sustainability. It has also led to better employment prospects for youth, as have focused efforts to enhance market-based skills training.  
Despite its miniscule carbon footprint, Pakistan faces the enormous and imminent impacts of global climate change. Therefore, climate adaptation is imperative for the country. Pakistan has initiated actions to protect the environment and contribute to minimizing the adverse impacts of climate change. Both climate adaptation and mitigation are reflected in the country’s policy and implementation approach. After the successful completion of Pakistan’s Billion Tree planting drive across 350,000 hectares – the first Bonn Challenge pledge to meet and surpass its target – Pakistan has scaled up the initiative to the 10 Billion Tree Tsunami. This five-year, country-wide tree planting drive aims to restore depleted forests and mitigate climate change. With the launch the Clean and Green Pakistan and Recharge Pakistan initiative, the country has taken the lead in ‘nature-based solutions for ecosystem restoration’ among developing countries, with the added benefits of safeguarding biodiversity and generating livelihood opportunities. 
The recently elected government has launched the Naya (New) Pakistan Housing Program whereby houses will be constructed and offered on an affordable price to a much larger segment of population by offering them the facility to avail long term loans for purchasing them. The first phase of this project was launched in April 2019, and construction of 110,000 units was initiated in Quetta and Gwadar. The Government of Pakistan is keen to partner with the private sector for the “Naya (New) Pakistan Housing Project”. 
While Pakistan is well prepared to achieve the SDGs, several challenges remain. Financing the SDGs in a slow growth environment will be a trying task, compounded by the knowledge and technology gap in developing local solutions and improving efficiency through improved governance. Exploring innovative financing, developing a Responsible Business Framework and engaging local universities in devising local solutions for local problems is the strategy that Pakistan is pursuing.  
Pakistan is advancing towards its commitment to the 2030 Agenda by working to strengthen institutional mechanisms, enhance awareness, create productive partnerships and improve coordination. A key aspect of its implementation strategy is strengthening existing alliances and forging new ones, while leveraging technology and mobilizing finance. Partnerships and close collaboration with a broad array of governmental, private sector, civil society, media stakeholders supplemented by regional and international support, will continue to be a major feature. Notwithstanding economic and financial challenges, Pakistan will continue to work towards achieving the SDGs through innovative, targeted and focused implementation strategies in the social, economic and environmental spheres. 
 	 



1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVES OF THE VOLUNTARY NATIONAL REVIEW 
Pakistan committed to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in October 2015. Pakistan’s first Voluntary National Review outlines the country’s level of preparedness for achieving the SDGs, reports progress on several SDGs and puts forth future plans, which hinge on multi-stakeholder engagement, institutional mechanisms, the allocation of financial resources and the streamlining of policies. 
1.1.1 Country Context 
Although growth and social development should go side by side, growth in Pakistan has not contributed to balanced social development in recent decades, primarily due to high levels of population growth. As a result, many of Pakistan’s social indicators do not match significant levels of economic growth, averaging 4 per cent per year. This makes the Sustainable Development Goals a key priority for the country. 

 
After committing to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in 2015, Pakistan became the first country in the world to adopt the SDGs as its own national development goals through a National Assembly Resolution in February 2016. At the same time, Pakistan’s Parliament became the first to establish an SDG Unit dedicated solely to the 17 goals. Pakistan began working on the SDGs as early as 2013, when the United Nations selected Pakistan as one of the countries to conduct consultations on the post-2015 development agenda. The key development priorities were identified during consultations. These included peace and security, governance, inclusive economic growth, the rule of law, social development, gender equality and women’s empowerment, sustainable low-cost energy, disaster response and preparedness, and the much-needed broader role of the developed world.2 These priorities were incorporated in Pakistan’s long-term perspective development document. In 2014, the National Assembly aligned its long-term Strategic Plan 2014-2018 with the post-2015 agenda. In 2017, National and Provincial Parliamentary Taskforces were created to focus on the SDGs3 during parliamentary work. 
Pakistan is a federation comprising four provinces (Punjab, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan), a federal capital (Islamabad Capital Territory) and two federally administered areas (Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) and 
Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJ&K)). The Constitution provides for provincial autonomy, particularly in terms of social service delivery, while the Federal Government’s support of provincial efforts is a state responsibility. Key social sectors are primarily the responsibility of provincial governments – including health, education, climate change, human rights, population and social welfare, food and agriculture, water supply & sanitation while the Federal Government is responsible for coordination and international commitments. The Federal Government also exclusively retains functions related to finance, defense, natural resources and foreign affairs.   
Pakistan’s local government system is in place to bring the government closer to the people. This is enshrined in the Constitution, which empowers each province to set up its own local governments. The local government system in Pakistan is a three-tier system, integrated through a bottom-up planning approach. It is supported by the provinces’ local government departments, with the Federal Ministry of Inter-Provincial Coordination ensuring national level coordination. Effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda in Pakistan hinges on the effectiveness of the local government system – a potentially viable tool for embedding the SDGs at the grassroots level. The goals’ achievement ultimately depends on the ability of local and provincial governments to promote integrated, inclusive and sustainable development.  
In 2018, major promising developments included Pakistan’s third consecutive elections and second successive democratic transition of political power. This has allowed several institutions to grow stronger, including the Elections Commission of Pakistan (ECP), the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), the Supreme Court of Pakistan, and the electronic and print media.  
1.1.2 National Priorities 
Since the adoption of SDGs, the country has worked to mainstream the SDGs in all its policies, plans and strategies. Pakistan’s long-term development agenda, provincial development strategies and five-year plans are all aligned with the SDGs. All tiers of government are actively participating in the SDGs’ implementation. In 2017, the first Local Government Summit on the SDGs identified education, employment, energy, water, and peace and governance as major issues to address. The Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) has increased spending on energy, law and order, and security at the federal level. In tandem, education, health, and water and sanitation receive higher share of provincial budgets. 
Based on the priorities highlighted by the public during consultations on the post-2015 agenda, and the debates undertaken during the Local Government Summit in 2017, an objective criterion – encompassing seven dimensions – was developed to prioritize national requirements. This seven-dimensional criterion guided inter-provincial discussions on identifying national priorities. Based on the outcomes of these discussions, a framework was devised to prioritize the SDGs in the Pakistani context. Accordingly, a National SDG Framework was prepared. 
The National Economic Council, chaired by the Prime Minister, is Pakistan’s highest forum for the approval of plans for the implementation of policies. In 2018, the National Economic Council approved the National SDGs Framework. The framework prioritizes the global goals into three categories. While all goals will be worked on simultaneously, Category 1 goals are those that require immediate attention to achieve rapid results which will pave the way for achieving the remaining goals. The framework’s categories prioritize the goals as follows:  
• Category 1 – SDG 2 (‘No Hunger’), SDG 3 (‘Good Health and Well-Being’), SDG 4 (‘Quality Education’), SDG 6 (‘Clean Water and Sanitation’), SDG 7 (‘Affordable and Clean Energy’), SDG 8 (‘Decent Work and Economic Growth)’ and SDG 16 (‘Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions’).  
• Category 2 – SDG 1 (‘No Poverty’), SDG 5 (‘Gender Equality’), SDG 9 (‘Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure’), SDG 10 (‘Reduced Inequalities’), SDG 11 (‘Sustainable Cities and Communities’) and SDG 17 (‘Partnerships for the Goals’).  
• Category 3 – SDG 12 (‘Responsible Consumption and Production’), SDG 13 (‘Climate Action’), SDG 14 (‘Life below Sea’) and SDG 15 (‘Life on Land’). 
1.1.3 Targets for Sustainable Development  
To be sustainable, Pakistan recognizes that the three core dimensions of development must be connected – social, economic and environmental. Working towards these three main dimensions of the SDGs compels us to seek for interconnectivity when devising policy frameworks. Lessons learned from the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in Pakistan speak to the need to devise integrated policies that connect these three dimensions of development. For instance, poverty reduction requires strong policies in terms of employment, social protection, better health and nutrition, and a clean environment. Similarly, ending stunting requires a clean environment, good hygiene within and outside of the home, proper nutrition, and better healthcare and health education. Following an integrated approach, Pakistan has made considerable progress on several fronts, including reducing poverty, reducing stunting among children, increasing school enrolment and promoting gender equality by reforming policies and introducing legislation to empower women. The National Assembly building has been ‘greened’ and is now solar powered, a symbolic move towards renewable energy sources. 
To achieve Pakistan’s sustainable development targets, effective coordination is required among all the stakeholders – including the Government, private sector, civil society and academia – in terms of devising and effectively implementing policies. To address financing and governance issues, the Government has engaged a group of experts to identify solutions. Similar deliberations are on-going to devise a mechanism for effective public-private partnerships (PPPs), and engagement with development partners and civil society. Academia and think tanks have established special SDG Units and SDG Centres of Excellence to spearhead research on different goals.  
The overall target of all of these efforts is to improve living standards for the people of Pakistan, and to lift at least half of all impoverished persons out of poverty. Pakistan plans to achieve SDG targets by taking significant steps towards fostering human development, improving public service delivery, removing regional disparities in infrastructure development, and reviving the economy so that enough jobs are available for the educated and skilled. On the climate front, Pakistan’s target is to further minimize its carbon footprint and take steps to safeguard the environment, such as large-scale tree planting campaigns and extending the country’s forest cover.  
 
 
 
 	 



Voluntary National Review – Pakistan 2019 
 
2 VOLUNTARY NATIONAL REVIEW  
2.1 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS 
The MoPDR developed a process framework on the VNR objectives and scope, alongside its proposed methodology and a stakeholder engagement plan. Guidelines for preparing the review were shared with provinces and the federally administered areas. The first national multi-stakeholder consultation in the capital, Islamabad, was held on the 24th October 2018. The consultation acquainted a wider audience with the VNR and incorporated their feedback into the preparation process. The role of P&DDs was instrumental throughout the entire process, which involved conducting multi-stakeholder consultations and preparing provincial reports with extensive support of partners and subject matter experts. 
2.2 METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH: INCLUSIVITY 
The cornerstone of the VNR process was multi-stakeholder engagement and a ‘whole government’ approach, which saw federal and provincial stakeholders working side-by-side to maximize inclusivity. Consultative sessions at the federal, provincial and federally administered areas levels included women parliamentarians, government officials, representatives of the private sector, development partners, civil society, think tanks and academia. These consultations were held in the provinces of Punjab, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, and in the federally administered areas of Gilgit-Baltistan, Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Islamabad Capital Territory. To streamline these consultations, the scope was defined around seven thematic areas i.e. advocacy and awareness; legal and regulatory regime; institutional mechanisms; means of implementation (resources for the goals); key initiatives for the SDGs; challenges to localizing and implementing the goals; and monitoring, evaluation and reporting mechanisms.  
Stakeholders were divided into thematic clusters and groups, encompassing interrelated and cross-cutting SDGs. Focused discussions were held with these clusters and groups to identify local priorities and promote contextualization. In parallel, a series of consultations took place in the federal capital, federally administered areas and the provinces.  
All consultations were designed to be participatory and collaborative. They included diverse stakeholders, who were encouraged to provide innovative solutions to existing challenges. The key findings of these consultations were compiled by the provinces and federally administered areas into sub-VNR reports. All of these reports were then collated at the MoPDR to articulate Pakistan’s overall level of preparedness vis-àvis the 2030 Agenda. Existing policies, plans and analyses related to public investment were also used to corroborate the alignment of the development environment in Pakistan with the country’s commitment to achieving the SDGs. 
In addition, a parallel consultation process was initiated in collaboration with civil society organizations. This process had the dual objective of informing the public at the grassroots level about the SDGs and the VNR, and to seek their input on improving policies and plans for achieving the SDGs. Similarly, a series of consultations was conducted with persons with disabilities to include their voice in the VNR. Pakistan’s private sector conducted a number of separate consultations, whose inputs are included in this report.  A national level consultation deliberated on the draft VNR Report before it was finalized. The final report was shared with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for submission to the UN DESA for the High-Level Political Forum (HLPF) meeting in July 2019.

2.3 STAKEHOLDERS IN VNR CONSULTATIONS 
A wide array of stakeholders participated in VNR consultations at the federal, provincial and federally administered area levels. Key stakeholders from the public sector included relevant representatives from federal ministries and agencies, provincial and federally administered areas line departments, and district governments. Statistical organizations, including the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), were important stakeholders at these consultations. Strong participation was also forthcoming from several civil society organizations (CSOs), think tanks, academia, the private sector, and international development partners. All consultations strived to include the voice of those representing marginalized groups, including women, transgender persons, children and persons with disabilities.

3 POLICY AND ENABLING ENVIRONMENT FOR ACHIEVING THE 2030 AGENDA 
3.1 OWNERSHIP, COMMITMENT AND PLANNING 
Drawing on lessons learned from the MDGs, Pakistan adopted SDGs early on and followed a bottom-up approach to achieving the SDGs, adopting appropriate guidance and devising institutional arrangements right from the start.  Unlike MDGs, Pakistan started with localization plans, disaggregated data and above all, a strong political will and country ownership. 
3.1.1 Unanimous adoption by the National Assembly 
Pakistan’s parliament was the first in the world to constitute SDG Taskforces, as did the National Assembly and each Provincial Assembly– all with the aim of overseeing progress. Pakistan’s efforts at localizing the 2030 Agenda have been recognized nationally and internationally. In 2017, the Minister for PD&R was commended for his proactive efforts to support the institutional mechanism for achieving the SDGs in Pakistan. UNDP named him the ‘Champion Minister’ on the SDGs in Asia and the Pacific at a high-level regional SDG conference. 
3.1.2 National Advisory Committee (NAC) on the SDGs 
The Minister for PD&R will chair the National Advisory Committee on the SDGs to respond to the universal and inclusive nature of this ambitious agenda. The Committee will include representatives from the federal and provincial governments and SDG Taskforces. It will also include representation from the National Assembly, the private sector and experts on women and poverty. The Committee will provide strategic leadership for achieving the SDGs, while guiding effective cross-sectoral and inter-provincial coordination. Provincial governments are also establishing Provincial Advisory Committees. Punjab has already notified its Committee to guide SDG implementation in the province, as well as to support the formulation of the provincial SDG Framework.  
3.1.3 2030 Agenda development perspective  
The Ministry of PD&R, with the consensus of all provinces, designed Pakistan’s overarching national development framework which identifies seven pillars of reform, outlining quantifiable targets under each pillar. This provides a direction and aligns subsequent interventions towards achieving the national SDG goals. Extensive consultations with a wide array of stakeholders formed the basis of developing a national narrative and the identification of its seven priority areas or pillars – each of which is connected to the SDGs. In addition to its focus on economic prosperity, there is a firm national commitment to ensuring lasting social and environmental sustainability, with a focus on empowering those in most need and anticipating the SDGs’ commitment to ‘leave no one behind’. 
  
3.2 LEGISLATION FOR THE SDGS  
Box 1: Centre of Excellence for training parliamentarians on the SDGs  

The Pakistan Institute of Parliamentary Services (PIPS), an attached department of the National Assembly, was established in 2008 to strengthen understandings of, and capacities on, the SDGs among members of the Senate and Pakistan’s national and provincial assemblies. As Pakistan was the first country to establish a Parliamentary MDG Taskforce Secretariat, a National Conference on the MDGs was held at PIPS in 2014. This was the precursor to action plans for shaping the social, economic and political landscape. Crucially, the event integrated the SDGs in the National Assembly’s strategic framework and resulted in the creation of Parliamentary SDG Taskforces within national, provincial and administrative area assemblies – the first such move in the world.  
Five PIPS Parliamentary Resource Centres, at the national and provincial levels, include SDG Secretariats to support Taskforce members in terms of research and legislation. PIPS has supported roundtables and conferences on the SDGs that bring together stakeholders from the parliament, ministries, civil society and other spheres to develop consensus on Pakistan’s national narrative on the 2030 Agenda. Some 134 members of Taskforces and 500 other parliamentarians have attended these sessions. This has resulted in SDG-related legislation, backed by PIPS’s technical research and advice. The National and Provincial Parliamentary Taskforces have a significant role to play in filling legislative gaps, promulgating new legislative frameworks and amending existing laws to facilitate the SDGs’ implementation. Composed of members of National and Provincial Assemblies, Taskforce members are aware of on-the-ground realities. Therefore, they are well-placed to strengthen legislation related to the SDGs with a view to mainstreaming the 2030 Agenda. These members will be equally instrumental in mainstreaming the 2030 Agenda in their constituencies. Gilgit-Baltistan’s Parliamentary Taskforce includes one member from each of the districts, with 30 per cent representation of women, to keep track of the SDGs implementation.   The National Assembly’s Parliamentary SDG Secretariat has engaged various stakeholders to develop a structured framework and work plans around key priorities – such as health, education, climate change, human rights and child 
immunization. Its principle objective is to keep parliamentarians updated on progress made on the SDGs, especially in their constituencies. It encourages using this information to inform the design and implementation of effective legislation and oversight mechanisms. 
Across Pakistan, multiple laws and regulations have been approved and promulgated to target core sustainable development issues. The greatest number of legislations approved and enacted by national and provincial assemblies concern SDG Goal 16 (‘Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions’), SDG 8 (‘Decent Work and Economic Growth’) and SDG 4 (‘Quality Education’). There will be more focus on SDG  6 (‘Clean Water and Sanitation’), SDG 7 (‘Affordable and Clean Energy’), SDG 12 (‘Responsible Consumption and Production’), and all three goals on environmental sustainability and biodiversity – SDG 13 (‘Climate Action’), SDG 14 (‘Life below Sea’) and SDG 15 (‘Life on Land’) in coming years. 
 
3.3 ALIGNING POLICIES WITH THE SDGS  
All tiers of government in Pakistan are aligning existing and new policies with the 2030 Agenda. To fast-track the SDGs, several new policies have been formulated and approved by relevant authorities. A significant proportion of these policies across the board focus on empowering women at home and at work, as well as and improving governance and accountability systems. Salient features of policy alignment include: 
i. Pakistan’s 12th Five Year Plan (2018-23) is aligned with the SDGs’ objectives of equity, inclusivity and sustainability. 
ii. Existing policies and plans not only target SDGs, but also focus on developing cross-sectoral synergies. Punjab’s development framework, for example, has started assessing the impact of each of the province’s development projects on the SDGs. 
iii. Sindh’s Climate Change Policy 2018 and Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Policy 2017 are aligned with the SDGs.  
iv. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s policy focus is on governance, justice, transparency and empowering women. As such, in line with the SDGs, the province’s Sustainable Development Strategy (2018-23) emphasizes the promotion of equity, inclusivity and sustainability. 
v. Balochistan’s Comprehensive Development & Growth Strategy (BCDGS) 2018-24 aims to leverage opportunities emanating from the 2030 Agenda and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) initiative.  
vi. In Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir, the policy focus is on advocacy and raising awareness for achieving the SDGs.  
3.4 INTEGRATING THE THREE DIMENSIONS OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 
Several industrialized countries have experienced growth and development side by side, while many others where industrialization occurred more recently prioritized social indicators before moving towards higher growth. Environment issues in both types of countries were mainstreamed within the development agenda after social development and sustained economic growth had been achieved. This approach has put future generations around the globe at great risk. This is precisely why Pakistan, and a range of developing nations around the globe, are at high risk of climate change despite having relatively low carbon footprints. As such, Pakistan is working to prioritize social and environmental sustainability in its overall economic growth objectives. 
Pakistan is prioritizing consistency in policies and better coordination among stakeholders. The interconnection of the SDGs’ key dimensions (economic, social and environmental sustainability, coupled with improved governance) creates externalities when interact with each other. Pakistan is endeavouring to capitalize on positive externalities or ‘synergies’, while minimizing negative externalities or ‘trade-offs’.  For instance, the two indicators of SDG target 3.9 (substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water and soil pollution and contamination) are SDG indicators 3.9.1 (Mortality rate attributed to household and ambient air pollution) and 3.9.2 (Mortality rate attributed to unsafe water, unsafe sanitation and lack of hygiene) are monitored by two different departments in Pakistan from their respective perspective.  
 

Identifying trade-offs and minimizing their negative impact is the responsibility of experts, while solutions must be implemented by relevant government agencies. For this reason, it is necessary to understand the interlinkages between, and ways to synergize the outcomes of, Pakistan’s policies, programmes and projects. The MoPDR organized a training initiative on inter-linkages between different SDGs using leverage points for healthy debate and better coordination among stakeholders. This training was put in practice during the multi-stakeholder consultations for the development of Pakistan’s VNR report. As such, for 

Box 2: Pak SDGs & Community Development Programme  
In 2014, the Government of Pakistan established a ‘Pak SDGs & Community Development Programme’. Its objective is to divert a sizable portion of public investments by the federal government to fulfil the basic needs of communities at the local level. The programme identifies demand-driven development needs and, through an agreed and approved mechanism, develops feasible projects in social and infrastructure sectors. These are implemented through public sector agencies. Provincial and district governments are encouraged to compete for matching federal grants and use these to meet the needs of local communities. Schemes are identified by local communities themselves, while a National Technical Committee evaluates feasible projects and allocates resources for their implementation. Preference is given to geographical pockets where people are deprived of basic civic services or basic infrastructure which would improve their living standards.  
 
 	 
example, debates on poverty reduction included experts on employment, social protection, health, nutrition, governance, the environment and reducing inequalities.  
Drawing on such experiences, Pakistan has developed a National SDG Framework that has been approved by the National Economic Council. As discussed in Chapter 2 and 7, the framework prioritizes the SDGs according to an objective criterion, encompassing seven dimensions. One of these dimensions is the multiplier effect of one target on others. The multiplier effect covers all four aforementioned dimensions of SDG targets wherever possible.  Policy reviews were also undertaken, considering these four dimensions of the 2030 Agenda – such as reviews of policies on drinking water, energy for all, trade, nutrition, food security and water. These reviews strived to include all relevant SDG targets and indicators.  



   GOAL 1 – NO POVERTY  
 
	I. 	SDG 1 – AN OVERVIEW 
In 2015-16, 24.3 per cent of Pakistan’s population lived below the national poverty line3. This amounts to around 50 million people, comparable to the population of a country like Colombia, or the combined populations of Australia and Cameroon. According to Pakistan’s multidimensional poverty index in 2014-15, 38.8 per cent of the population was multi-dimensionally poor4, with considerable regional variations. This indicates that an even larger proportion of the population is deprived across three critical dimensions – education, health and living standards. A significant proportion of population is faced with the risk of falling below the national poverty line if they experience sudden shocks.  
	II. 	PROGRESS, STATUS AND TRENDS 
Over the past decade, there has been a persistent decline in poverty. Specifically, there has been a decline of 26 percentage points in terms of the national poverty line, and of over 16 percentage points in terms of the multidimensional poverty headcount. This trend is consistent with the international measure – that is, of the population living below the international poverty line (measured in terms of USD 1.9 per day in 2011), indicating persons facing ‘extreme poverty’. The World Bank’s PovCalNet5 shows a decline of 10 percentage points in poverty in Pakistan between 2005 and 2015.

KEY INITIATIVES 
Progress on curbing poverty is attributable to Pakistan’s multi-sectoral poverty reduction strategy. This encompasses targeted interventions, such as the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), alongside private philanthropy and improved access to microfinance for rural communities. Key initiatives include Pakistan Bait-ul Mal, the Zakat and Ushr programmes, the Employees’ Old-Age Benefits Institution, the Worker’s Welfare Funds and provincial Employees’ Social Security Institutions. Poverty reduction has also been advanced through an improved law and order situation, greater political stability, the recovery of GDP growth, the sustained high level inflow of remittances, and the inclusive characteristics of the country’s economic growth. 
Since 2008, the BISP has disbursed PKR 267 billion (equivalent to USD 1.8 billion) to the poorest people in Pakistan6. This includes disbursements in the form of unconditional cash transfers to 5 million deserving families. The BISP also offers several conditional cash transfer initiatives. These include the Waseela-eTaleem programme for education, through which over 2.2 million out-of-school children between 5 and 12 years of age, from some of the country’s poorest families, have been enrolled in schools8. A total of 2 million such children will be enrolled over the next two years. 
Other notable initiatives include enhancing public development spending to improve infrastructure and generate employment in the infrastructure sector. Further efforts include expanding access to key services, such as the endowment fund for education, scaling up nutrition and increasing the coverage of health insurance (through Sehat Insaf Cards and Khidmat Cards). This is expected to provide access to quality healthcare over 80 million people in the coming years. Moreover, Panahgah (Shalter Homes) is another initiative for homeless and poor segments of the society. Revamping skills development and selfemployment schemes through youth business loan initiatives have proven to be effective. Successful efforts have been made to improve the generation and supply of energy ensuring that small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and businesses can produce undisrupted services and generate employment in the private sector. Similarly, increasing spending on education to empower Pakistan’s youth has been vital, with the aim of making them productive citizens. Investing in early harvest projects under the framework of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is an important move to facilitate long-term socio-economic uplift. The new government has broadened the scope of CPEC by including poverty alleviation and agriculture development.  
The recently elected government in the country has whole heartedly embraced the responsibility of lifting millions of its people out of poverty. Ehsaas  is one of the largest programs launched for the poor in Pakistan. To improve synergies among key initiatives and entities, while eliminating duplications and overlaps, the program provides an overarching strategy to protect the poor from any internal or external shocks. A primary component of this plan is coordinating the activities of organizations working on alleviating poverty, ensuring that they work on areas where they have a comparative advantage and encompasses multiple initiatives that are all targeted towards the betterment of the marginalized communities. Poverty Alleviation and Social Safety Division has been established with the mandate to introduce poverty reduction policies and bring the multiple poverty alleviation programs and interventions under one umbrella. It is further expected to strengthen the institutional capacity to effectively execute the Ehsaas program whose mandate involves 36 federal and provincial agencies and requires action on 115 policy parameters. The program focuses on reducing inequality; introducing safety nets for disadvantaged segments of the population; jobs and livelihoods; and human capital development. The program also aims to improve the nutritional status and reduce stunting in poverty-stricken communities. 
IV. 	PRIORITIES AND TARGETS  
In the coming years, Pakistan is committed to reducing poverty from 24.3 per cent to 19 per cent by 2023, while reducing the multidimensional poverty headcount from 38.8 per cent to 30 per cent over the same period. In addition, provincial social protection policies will be aligned with the provisions of the national framework for developing social protection policies. This will involve the planned creation of a database on the segments most in need, in order to ensure better targeting of poverty reduction measures. 
	V. 	PLANNED INITIATIVES  
Corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives will be enhanced with a view to reducing poverty, in consultation with Pakistan’s corporate and private sectors. A CSR framework will be compiled in collaboration with all relevant stakeholders to expand the outreach of CSR programmes for poverty reduction. The Benazir Income Support Programme’s unconditional cash transfers will be linked with inflation to shield beneficiaries from price shocks. In addition, quarterly payments will be enhanced for the poorest, to ensure that transfers meet their needs. 
The Ehsaas programme has developed a common metrics framework to improve the effectiveness of existing poverty programmes, through the design of robust implementation plans to build capacity, manage risks, and improve the performance of various organizations. Planned efforts of the Ehsaas programme include liaising with the private sector, identifying which of their practices can be replicated in the public sector, and using policy levers through which the private sector can enhance its impact. Under this programme, the Government will aim to increase expenditure on poverty alleviation to PKR 190 billion by 2020, in order to target those most in need – including widows, orphaned, and persons with disabilities.  
 
 
  	 
   GOAL 2 – ZERO HUNGER 
 
	I. 	SDG 2- AN OVERVIEW 
Stunting and malnutrition are immense challenges for Pakistan, persisting despite an increase in food production (particularly in wheat, rice and milk) over the past 25 years. Rising agricultural output notwithstanding, the country’s high population growth rate, inadequate distribution mechanisms and limited access to food underlie widespread malnutrition. Access constraints are prompted by high input costs and subsequent food price inflation, eroding poor people’s ability to purchase sufficient nutritious foods. Poor hygiene and food intake practices further compound health and nutrition related issues.  
High levels of malnutrition lead to low workforce productivity, costing Pakistan USD 7.6 billion, or 3 per cent of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP), every year7. Malnutrition not only adversely affects the country’s GDP, it has serious implications for Pakistan’s most important asset – its human resources. Malnutrition takes heavy toll on the population, especially on infants, children and women of reproductive age, most notably through high morbidity and mortality rates. Therefore, achieving the SDGs largely hinges upon eliminating hunger in all its forms.   
II. 	PROGRESS, STATUS AND TRENDS  
Recent national surveys reveal improvements in nutrition indicators. A modest, but persistent improvement was recorded between 1990 and 2011, as the proportion of children suffering from stunting fell from 50 per cent to 43.7 per cent, and the proportion of underweight children under the age of five declined from 40.4 per cent to 31.5 per cent. The pace of progress is picking up as a result of targeted initiatives, as stunting fell to 37.6 per cent in 2017-18, and the prevalence of underweight children declined to 23 per cent8.

KEY INITIATIVES 
In 2011, the Pakistan Integrated Nutrition Strategy (PINS) was formulated to synergize interventions. In 2013, Pakistan joined the global Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) movement, to scale up research, policy planning, monitoring mechanisms and coordinating among different stakeholders. In 2017, the Ministry of National Food Security and Research launched the country’s first National Food Security Policy and began implementing multi-sectoral nutrition strategies.  
With a particular focus on improving the nutritional status of women and children, the Pakistan Multi-Sectoral Nutrition Strategy 2018-25 (PMNS) and Pakistan Dietary Guidelines for Better Nutrition (PDGN) were prepared and launched. Leveraging public-private partnerships, a Food Fortification Programme is being implemented across 1,100 flour mills, and a Universal Salt Iodization (USI) Programme is operational in 110 districts.  Pakistan’s provinces have also spearheaded a range of initiatives to improve nutrition. The Punjab MultiSectoral Nutrition Strategy (MNSC) 2015 augments the Health Integrated Reforms Programme and the Stunting Prevention Nutrition Programme. The province of Sindh is implementing an ambitious Nutrition Support Programme, backed by an Accelerated Action Plan for the Reduction of Stunting and Malnutrition. 
In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, two notable initiatives include the Health Integrated Reforms Programme and the Stunting Prevention Rehabilitation Integrated Nutrition Gain (SPRING) project. Balochistan is implementing the Balochistan Nutrition Programme for Mothers & Children (BNPMC), alongside a Multi-Sectoral NutritionSpecific and Sensitive Interventions Programme. Other key initiatives include: 
• Tax exemptions on imports of food fortification equipment;  
• Bio-fortified, zinc-rich variety of wheat, “Zincol 2016”, to increase intakes of zinc and iron; 
• Enactment of Balochistan’s and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Protection and Promotion of Breastfeeding and Child Nutrition Acts, as well as the Punjab Infant Feeding Act;  
• Initiation of a wheat flour food fortification programme with the use of iron, folic acid, zinc, Vitamin B12, and the fortification of edible oil (‘ghee’) with Vitamins A and D; 
• Initiation of formulation of a National Policy Framework on Early Childhood Development (ECD); 
• Utilizing evidence of the National Nutrition Survey 2017-18 for policy planning and programming; and 
• Increased investments in nutrition-specific interventions and nutrition-sensitive approaches in the health, agriculture, social protection, and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) sectors to overcome malnutrition and stunting.  
IV. 	CHALLENGES AND LESSONS LEARNED  
Changing centuries-old traditional cultural dietary practices is also challenging. Efforts to date suggest that expanding the coverage, and improving the quality of education offers a vital lever for effectively addressing malnutrition in the country. 
	V. 	PRIORITIES AND TARGETS  
Achieving ‘zero hunger’ and addressing malnutrition are among the Government’s top priorities. During his first address to the nation in 2018, the Prime Minister of Pakistan affirmed his resolve to deal with poverty, hunger and stunting. Medium-term development targets have been formulated to achieve SDG 2. The overall strategy comprises enhancing nutrition awareness, institutional strengthening, improving coordination mechanisms, and mitigating data gaps.  
VI. 	PLANNED INITIATIVES 
Over the next five years, a multi-pronged strategy will be implemented to curb hunger and improve the population’s nutritional status. This will focus on multi-stakeholder coordination, raising awareness of healthy eating practices, institutional strengthening and engaging the private sector. Important initiatives  include: 
• Country-wide Nutrition Awareness and Institutional Strengthening Programme; 
• Utilization of specialized nutritious products for stunting prevention in commercial and social protection sectors, through public-private partnerships; 
• Initiation of a Multi-Sectoral Stunting, Malnutrition and Food Insecurity Prevention Project; 
• Establishment of a National Centre for Human Nutrition;  
• Development of a National Policy Framework on Early Childhood Development (ECD); 
• Strengthening Pakistan’s Monitoring, Evaluation, Accountability and Learning (MEAL) mechanism; and  
• Establishment of a Nutrition Information Management System.  
 
 	 
   GOAL 3 – GOOD HEALTH AND WELL-BEING 
 
	I. 	SDG 3 – AN OVERVIEW 
Health remains a top priority for Pakistan. Catering to the healthcare needs of its burgeoning population is a mammoth task. Wide-ranging political will exists to improve the population’s health status, as the country recognizes that investments in health promise positive results for the economy and society at large. SDG 3 is particularly important as a large segment of Pakistan’s population lives below the poverty line. Improving their health is expected to directly translate into sustainable economic growth, as performance on health is closely tied to economic performance. While a range of health-related challenges exist, Pakistan has been taking dedicated steps towards improving the health status of its growing population.  
	II. 	PROGRESS, STATUS AND TRENDS 
Pakistan’s infant mortality rate (IMR) declined from 74 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2012-13, to 62 in 2017-18. In a similar vein, its Neonatal Mortality Rate fell from 55 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2012-13, to 42 in 201720189. Estimates from 2015 indicate that the maternal mortality rate is 178 deaths per 100,000 live births10. Improvements in the status of maternal and neonatal health are reflective of improved access, providers’ availability and competency, and stronger infrastructure, systems and policies in place. Pakistan is striving to increase its critical workforce from 1.45 to 4.45 per 1,000 persons, in line with World Health Organization 
(WHO) guidelines11. With a population growth rate of 2.4 per cent, and an unmet demand for contraceptives of 
17.3 per cent, Pakistan’s contraceptive prevalence rate in 2018 remained stagnant at 34.2 per cent. The fertility rate has slightly decreased from 3.8 per cent in 2012-13, to 3.6 per cent in 2017-1812.  
The Government stands firm in its commitment to ensure full eradiation of polio through intensive efforts. Pakistan has tuberculosis incidence of 267 per 100,000 population13. The HIV prevalence rate is 0.1 percent, with status of concentrated epidemic in high risk groups exceeding 5 percent16. The mortality rate attributable to household and ambient air pollution is 173.6 persons per 100,0001415. Mortality from noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) is 24.7 percent16, with age-standardized NCD mortality rate at 713 per 100,000 population17. Pakistan is exploring dedicated action to curb the rising burden of NCDs.

The National Health Vision Pakistan 2016-2025 (NHV) was launched, based on an intensive consultative exercise at the national level. The National Health Vision enables provincial health departments to contextualize their policy frameworks with a view to achieving universal health coverage. To this end, supportive provincial legislation has been introduced, including the Punjab Hepatitis Act 2018, the Sindh Occupation Safety and Health Act 2017, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Public Health (Surveillance and Response) Act 2017, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Mental Health Act 2017, and the Balochistan Juvenile Smoking Act 2018. Legislative frameworks have also sought to support training and research, such as the Pakistan Health 
Research Council Act 2016 and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Medical Teaching Institutions Reforms Act 2016. Alongside legislative initiatives, multiple actions have been taken by Pakistan’s federal and provincial governments to advance health nationwide.  
Notable successes and good practices include the marked improvement in the percentage of deliveries attended by a skilled birth attendant, rising from 52 per cent in 2012-13 to 69 per cent in 2017-1818. This is due to multiple, simultaneous initiatives by provincial Maternal and Child Health Programmes. These range from enhancing access by introducing rural ambulances and Mobile Health Units, to upgrading 1,000 Basic Health Units (BHUs) to offer 24/7 services in Punjab, Sick Newborn Care and telemedicine units, and other publicprivate-partnership models in Sindh. Health weeks celebrated across extensive network of public health facilities attracted millions and were valuable in early detection and timely initiation of treatments to many screened.  
Immunization drive and the use of geographic information system (GIS)-enabled, real-time vaccinator mapping is another major initiative. Vaccination coverage under the Expanded Programme for Immunization (EPI) rose from 54 per cent in 2012-13 to 66 per cent in 2017-1821. This was supported by execution of immunization campaigns, through combined efforts of the government, UN agencies and other partner, for reaching millions of young children.  
To address the long-standing challenge of filling vacancies in primary public health facilities in rural settings, the recent Central Induction Policy for post-graduate training awards additional points to doctors who have served for over two years in rural or remote areas. This policy has been pivotal in attracting health workers to previously non-functional government health facilities in remote locations, while encouraging the retention of human resources for health and ensuring doctors’ availability in underserved districts. A health emergency programme was launched in the province of Balochistan to scale up medical equipment, supplies and the provision of medicines in health facilities. 
To ensure universal health coverage and reduce out-of-pocket health expenses for people living below the poverty line, a micro-health insurance programme was introduced at the national level. To date, the Sehat Sahulat programme has provided healthcare to 3 million people in 44 districts. To overcome the challenges of a lack of timely, accurate data, the process of revitalizing the Civil Registration and Vital Statistics programme has been initiated at the national level, establishing much-needed data collection systems, processes and a central information repository.  
IV. 	CHALLENGES AND LESSONS LEARNED 
To bring healthcare services closer to Pakistan’s population, a number of lessons learned have been identified for scaling up across the country. These include the availability of rural ambulance networks for pregnant women, the establishment of mobile health units, the upgrading of Basic Health Units, and the promulgation of legislation related to SDG 3. As noted above, these interventions have played a pivotal role in improving skilled birth attendance and deliveries in health facilities, directly affecting maternal and neonatal health.  
Developing human resources for health (HRH) is central to achieving SDG 3, as health systems can only function when the health workforce is fully geared towards overcoming system challenges.  
Compliance with international health regulations (IHR) is a critical area where Pakistan is seeking support to develop local capacities and systems that bolster the country’s preparedness to prevent, detect and respond to health threats. Since 2016, the provinces of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have taken dedicated steps towards system strengthening. As part of Pakistan’s plans to establish a Public Health Management Authority, a conceptual framework and draft public health legislation has been finalized in 
Punjab. Roll out has also been initiated in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with the establishment of a Public Health Surveillance Laboratory. The National Institute of Health is leading capacity building initiatives and operating a comprehensive National Reference Laboratory to spearhead disease surveillance. Pakistan is also looking to collaborate with countries that have successfully established systems and processes under the One Health approach. 
	V. 	PRIORITIES AND TARGETS 
In order to make substantive progress on SDG 3, Pakistan’s priorities include:  
• substantially increasing spending on health;  
• reducing the maternal mortality rate from 178 to less than 130 deaths per 100,000 live births; 
• reducing the infant and neonatal mortality rates from 74 and 42 deaths per 1,000 live births to less than 40 and 30 deaths per 1,000 live births, respectively;  
• reducing the fertility rate and improving modern contraceptive prevalence from 3.6 per cent to 3 percent; 
• complying with international health regulations and improving preparedness;  
• ensuring universal health coverage to make healthcare accessible, affordable and available to 
all; 
• establishing a network of maternal and neonatal child health hospitals;  
• improving diagnostic facilities at public sector health facilities; 
• strengthening the quality and increasing the availability of the health workforce;  • addressing school health and mental health; and  • improving health data generation and utilization.  VI. PLANNED INITIATIVES 
At present, national per capita spending on health is USD 36.2. The Government will work with provincial and partners to develop programmes and enhance health spending from the current 0.13 per cent of GDP to the internationally recommended 5 per cent through a gradual, phased approach.  
To reduce maternal mortality, Pakistan will focus on increasing skilled birth attendance. This will involve enhancing access through upgraded Basic Health Units, and the establishment of maternal and child health hospitals. To enable effective family planning, pre- and post-pregnancy care, and neonatal care, the Lady Health Workers (LHW) programme will be revitalized through adequate training, support and a revised service structure. Similarly, initiatives to reduce infant and neonatal mortality will involve training for birth attendants on neonatal resuscitation and ensuring immunization for all.  
To reduce the fertility rate and improve modern contraceptive prevalence, Pakistan will capitalize on economies of scale, integrating provincial Population Welfare and Health Departments to raise community awareness, and provide family planning commodities to families to promote optimal birth spacing. 
With a view to complying with international health regulations (IHR) and ensuring preparedness, national and provincial public health management authorities will provide scientific advice on protecting health, quantify risks (and the effectiveness of interventions), and play a key role in public health stewardship. The formation of Provincial Technical Committees in Sindh and Balochistan will guide the mainstreaming of SDG 3.  Ensuring universal health coverage – so as to make healthcare accessible, affordable and available to all – the Sehat Sahulat programme will be scaled up to all of Pakistan’s districts. Price regulation measures and drug quality control mechanisms will be introduced.  
Improving public sector health facilities will encompass increasing the number of 24/7 Basic Health Units (BHUs) and Rural Health Clinics (RHCs) equipped with a basic package of services, staff and ambulance services. These efforts will be complemented by upgrading secondary care facilities through the provision of adequate equipment, specialist doctors and medicines. It will also involve introducing incentive programmes to attract more doctors, Lady Health Workers and nurses to Basic Health Units, particularly in remote or hard-to-reach areas. 
A focus will be placed on improving diagnostic facilities at public sector health facilities, alongside prioritizing preventive and curative care for communicable diseases such as Hepatitis, tuberculosis and HIV. 
To improve the quality, and increase the availability, of Pakistan’s health workforce, training institutes for nurses and paramedical staff will be established nationwide. As part of efforts to promote school health, deworming programmes for school children and out-of-school children will be launched in collaboration with Education Departments, to be delivered through bi-annual cycles. A National Mental Health Policy will be developed, and the provinces will be encouraged to introduce initiatives to address mental health issues through improved service delivery and research.  
Efforts to improve data generation and utilization will center on strengthening the Civil Registration and Vital Statistics programme, with a focused approach to collect data at the grassroots level. With WHO’s support, the Islamabad Health Equity Model is being developed. This innovative model is expected to serve as a hallmark to facilitate high-risk mapping on prevalent diseases, allowing for endemic control. Similar centres of excellence will be established across the country, with learning documented and shared to inform scaling up. 
Areas which require advice and support for achieving SDG 3 – in terms of finance, capacity-building, technology and partnerships – include realistic budgeting, health workforce training and management, and the use of technology. First, realistic funding needs to be ensured for the effective implementation of SDG 3’s targets and related policies. There is a need for diversified financial inflows and for exploring co-sharing mechanisms. Global models for setting up a comprehensive health care financing system will be explored in order to define and develop local capacities to mobilize, pool and secure the equitable allocation of resources. In tandem, training for Pakistan’s health workforce will be prioritized with adequate infrastructure, an experienced and well-trained faculty, and dedicated funding. 
While there has been rapid progress on the integration of technologies in health, particularly for data monitoring, GIS-tracking and surveillance, these efforts need to be scaled up in Pakistan. Limited work has been done on artificial intelligence – such as machine learning for diagnostics, and local research and drug or technology development. Pakistan will strive to lessen reliance on international partners for drugs and supplies sourcing, in order to reduce the costs of drugs for the public and decrease out-of-pocket health expenses.  	 
 GOAL 5 – GENDER EQUALITY  
 
	I. 	SDG 5 – AN OVERVIEW 
Women make up 48.8 per cent of the Pakistan’s population. There are 105 men for every 100 women in the country.19 The female literacy rate of 49 per cent is relatively lower than the male literacy rate of 70 per cent. Although an estimated 60 million women are of working age, only 20 per cent participate in ‘paid’ labour23. Their retention in the labour market is challenged by competing family priorities, inflexible workplace policies and the structural gendered workplace barriers. These challenges not withstanding, efforts by the Government to increase women’s representation in workforce, and dedicated quotas in different sectors continue. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates that, by addressing the gender parity, Pakistan stands to gain USD 91.5 billion per year.20 Working women continue to face wide sectoral and occupational segregation that can only be addressed by designing gender-responsive policies.  
Women’s participation is limited not just in labour, but also in decision-making, family planning, property and asset ownership and education-seeking. Pakistan recognizes gender equality as crucial for achieving the overall targets of all 17 SDGs, not just SDG 5, and that more women in leadership positions will play a major role in closing the equity opportunity gap. By harnessing the full potential of the female workforce, for example, Pakistan will be able to spearhead economic equity.  
The importance assigned to countering violence against women and girls is reflected in a range of national and provincial legislations and programmes developed in the recent years to address this problem and make SDG 5 a top priority for the country.   
II. 	PROGRESS, STATUS AND TRENDS 
Women’s labour force participation is gradually increasing in Pakistan. There is also an increase in the number of young women, between the ages of 15-24 years of age, in higher education and entering professional categories in the workforce. As noted above, there continues to be a gender gap in education, with significant regional variations. Whereas the proportion of women working in managerial positions has marginally increased from 0.3 per cent in 2012-13, to 0.5 per cent in 2018, women are highly represented in certain sectors. For instance, women represent over 70 per cent of Pakistan’s health workforce. Progressive legislations have been passed and workplace policies introduced to encourage more women to enter the labour market. With the establishment of provincial and national Commissions on the Status of Women, serious attempts to mainstream gender have been introduced by the Government. There have been dedicated efforts to ensure the adequate representation of women on forums, boards, organizations and in leadership positions. Following the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, there have been key societal wins – women today serve as pilots in the Pakistan Airforce, generals in the Armed Forces, occupy key political and bureaucratic positions, win Academy Awards (Oscars) and represent Pakistan at international sports events and conferences. Gender mainstreaming has also made it to the mainstream media, with the immense success of prime-time serials with strong educational content for changing behaviours around gender equality. With greater sensitization regarding the application of a gender lens, efforts are underway to increase women’s representation in local governments from the current level of 16.1 per cent and improve girls’ school enrolment.  
Women's participation as voters has improved, with a 13 per cent increase in the total number of women registered voters between 2013 and 2017. Women's access to justice has also experienced improvements.

III. 	KEY INITIATIVES 
Federal and provincial governments have taken a strong stance by introducing multiple initiatives to address gender parity. Many of these have been met by highly favourable feedback, such as the establishment a tollfree women helpline in Punjab, the Bolo Helpline and the establishment of women-only police station in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and the creation of training and rehabilitation centres in Sindh and across the country.  National and provincial Commissions on the Status of Women have been at the forefront of efforts to promote gender equality and women’s empowerment. The Maternity Benefits Act has been amended at the national and provincial levels. In addition to provincial Domestic Violence Protection and Prevention Act and Protection against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Acts, have also been passed. Child Marriage Act establishes a minimum age for marriage to curb the practice of early or child marriages. 
Following the adoption of the SDGs, the Government initiated dedicated efforts to achieve SDG 5, particularly SDG targets 5.5.1 and 5.5.2. These efforts began with the collection and reporting of gender-disaggregated data, alongside quota setting for women’s employment in the public sector, and the requirement that women must have at least 33 per cent representation on the boards of statutory bodies and public sector organizations. A Gender Management Information System was launched in Punjab, while Sindh developed a Gender Reforms Action Plan (GRAP). Funds were allocated by both provinces for the establishment of day care centres at workplaces. 
To address gender inequalities in policy design, programme planning, budgeting and resource allocation, trainings are organized for public sector officials on gender-responsive budgeting. These aim to ensure that policy-makers understand gender issues and nuances, while making conscious efforts to facilitate the achievement of women’s rights and economic empowerment. 
IV. 	CHALLENGES AND LESSONS LEARNED 
Key efforts include annual reporting on gender parity, stocktaking on legislation and policy implementation for women empowerment’s, and participation in policy-making. Such learning needs to be expanded and scaled up across the country. The introduction of Punjab’s Gender Management Information System will be a pivotal initiative to be expanded, leading to the establishment of a comprehensive gender database. Another important lesson may be drawn from the provinces’ successful establishment of dedicated funds for providing grants to organizations interested in establishing day care centers.  
Gender is often considered an exclusive interest group, rather than a cross-cutting theme. Orientating decision-makers and policy-makers on gender-responsive design and planning is a key challenge facing the Government. Best practices and learning from other countries would help to institutionalize genderresponsive policy-making in Pakistan. In particular, Pakistan seeks partnerships and networking with other countries and UN agencies for shaping and strengthening programmes and initiatives that promote gender parity at all levels. 
This entails designing gender-responsive budgets, using skills and tools to assess the different needs of women and men, their contributions within existing revenues, expenditures and allocations, and calls for adjusting budget policies to benefit all groups.  
There is also a need to revise the methodology used for calculating gender gaps. Pakistan has raised technical concerns on the methodology adopted by the World Economic Forum’s Gender Gap Report, and strongly feels that this should be addressed to reflect more valid and reliable scores on relevant indices. Technical experts in Pakistan are willing to work with the global community to developing a robust and transparent methodology in this context. 
	V. 	PRIORITIES AND TARGETS 
Pakistan’s key priorities related to SDG 5 include:  
• effectively monitoring progress on the implementation of gender-responsive policy frameworks; 
• creating structures to further support women in the labour market;  
• establishing systems and structures to scientifically develop, implement, monitor and evaluate behavioural change communication interventions to promote gender parity at all levels;  
• encouraging women entrepreneurs; and  
• strengthening structures to combat violence against women.   
VI. 	PLANNED INITIATIVES 
The 12th Five Year Plan (2018-2023) aims to Improve female labor force participation from 14.50% to 24.50%. Multiple initiatives are planned for empowering women and dedicated funds have been allocated for women development projects focusing on girl education and special loans for women entrepreneurs. A few legislative measures have been introduced for providing them with equal opportunity and for their workplace safety. The prime minister recently inaugurated the “one woman, one bank account plan” whereby 5.7 million women would be able to open their savings accounts.  
The approval and institutionalization of the Gender Equality & Women Empowerment Policy (2019-2023) to create a conducive environment for women in society and the workplace, strive towards gender inclusivity in the labour force, support girls’ education, and facilitate equitable economic opportunities for women. Structures will be created to support women in the labour market, including Women’s Economic Empowerment and Social Entrepreneurship Centres under the Poverty Alleviation and Social Safety Division.  
To encourage women entrepreneurs, ICT and skills development workshops will be undertaken, while interest-free micro finance loans will be provided to enable women to start their own businesses. Women entrepreneurs will also be supported through Women Business Incubation Centres. Structures will also be established to combat violence against women, most notably Shelter Homes for Women in Distress.  
 
 
   	 

  GOAL 7 – AFFORDABLE AND CLEAN ENERGY 
 
	I. 	SDG 7 – AN OVERVIEW  
Pakistan is an energy deficient country and relies heavily on fossil fuels to generate electricity. Imports account for almost 43 per cent of primary energy in the country, with large quantities of liquefied natural gas (LNG) imported to bridge the supply-demand gap. Energy prices are steadily increasing, creating significant affordability concerns. With its cross-cutting links with other global goals, SDG 7 is among the most important goals for Pakistan.  
The uninterrupted supply of energy increases efficiency and economic growth. It is essential for reducing inequalities and generating employment. Pakistan requires immense investments in affordable, clean and renewable energy sources and technologies. The share of hydropower in Pakistan’s total energy supply mix is approximately 30 per cent21. 
II. 	PROGRESS, STATUS AND TRENDS 
To accelerate progress on SDG 7, Pakistan has invested heavily in overcoming energy shortages, increasing energy generation and expanding access to electricity. Over the past ten years, access to electricity increased by 8 percentage points. The proportion of the population who rely on clean fuels and technologies risen by 11 percentage points22 in the same period. An especially notable initiative was the construction and operationalization of the Quaid-e-Azam Solar Park – Pakistan’s first utility scale, on-grid solar power plant of 1,000 MW. Several other solar plants have also been set up and many rural areas provided with small-scale solar panel systems to provide basic electricity for local households.  
The Jhimpir Wind Power Plant – whose total generation capacity is 50 MW – was installed in the province of Sindh’s wind corridor, with the potential for producing 50,000 MW with its average wind speeds of over 7 metres per second.

KEY INITIATIVES 
In line with the maxim, “a megawatt saved is better than a megawatt produced”, improving energy efficiency and conservation are among Pakistan’s top priorities. To this end, a National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (NEECA) has been established to identify energy efficiency and conservation opportunities. Initiatives on renewable energy focus on affordable energy. Efforts are underway to increase the share of renewables in Pakistan’s energy supply mix to 20 per cent in 2025, and 30 per cent by 2030. The Alternative Energy Development Board (AEDB) has supported the private sector’s installation of several renewable energy plants, including wind and solar power plants. The AEDB is also facilitating bagasse-based co-generation projects under the Framework for Power Co-generation (Bagasse/Biomass) 2013. Their efforts have enabled Pakistan to rise through the ranks of countries considered attractive for renewable energy investments – from 38th in 2016 to 26th in 2018.24  
The national parliament took a major step towards adopting clean energy when the parliament building was turned into a sustainable, green building in 2016. The “Green Parliament of Pakistan” has the distinction of being “world’s first largest solar-powered legislative building”. In addition to reducing air pollution, it sets a standard for other government departments and private buildings.  
IV. 	CHALLENGES AND LESSONS LEARNED  
There is a need to simplify procedures, including legislative measures, to encourage private sector investments in public-private clean energy projects. Effective coordination is needed among entities responsible for promoting private investment. A lack of technical efficiency constrains Pakistan’s ability to produce clean, affordable energy. This can be addressed through technology transfers, by adopting the latest efficient technologies, and by engaging with countries willing to invest in clean, renewable energy in Pakistan. 
	V. 	PRIORITIES AND TARGETS 
Ensuring uninterrupted energy supplies through energy integration is a key priority. Pakistan is upgrading its Renewable Energy Policy to attract investment for an energy mix that is reliable, renewable and affordable. 
At the same time, the country is exploring ways of tapping its unconventional gas resource potential, in order to overcome shortage of gas. To supplement the indigenous gas supply, natural gas import projects will be actively pursued in the context of regional cooperation in the energy sector, such as the TurkmenistanAfghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) gas pipeline project.  
To mitigate high levels of fuel consumption in transport sector, electric vehicles are being introduced. Associated policy measures are also being implemented, while addressing the strengths, opportunities and limitations of such initiatives through fiscal incentives. 
VI. 	PLANNED INITIATIVES 
Over the next five years, Pakistan aims to reduce its dependence on energy imports. It will progressively and substantially increase the share of indigenous, clean resources in the nation’s energy supply mix to steer the sector towards sustainability. A newly formulated road map for a power market open to competition will also be implemented. 
The Government has decided to solarize 20,000 schools in Punjab province, while focusing on remote areas. In the first phase of the “Ujala” program, 10,800 schools of South Punjab will be illuminated through installation of the solar panels.  
The ‘energy benchmarking’ of public buildings is underway, with a view to enabling energy conservation, conversion to solar energy, and improving energy productivity and efficiency. The Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All) has been launched to achieve universal access to energy, while doubling the rate of improvement in energy efficiency and the share of renewable energy in the supply mix. A related National Action Plan 201830, finalized through a consultative process, will be launched in 2019. The ‘Bright Balochistan’ project will also be launched to provide energy to off-grid communities in the province through renewable technologies. In addition, a comprehensive programme for the conversion of Balochistan’s agriculture tube wells to solar power will be rolled out.  
 	 
 GOAL 8 – DECENT WORK AND ECONOMIC GROWTH 
 
	I. 	SDG 8 – AN OVERVIEW 
Sustained, indigenous and inclusive growth is a high priority agenda of the present government of Pakistan. Entrepreneurship and the knowledge economy also rated high on the national agenda. Pakistan recognizes that a thriving, diverse economy – whose benefits are shared equitably by all members of society – is a necessary pathway to prosperity for all. Such prosperity, in turn, is a precursor to the well-being of the country’s population and the protection of its environment. Pakistan’s focus on sustainable, inclusive economic growth and decent work will be essential for addressing the challenges of a young, rapidly growing and urbanizing population, addressing underemployment and unemployment, and raising the living standard of people. 
II. 	PROGRESS, STATUS AND TRENDS 
Pakistan has experienced steady economic growth in recent years, which reached a rate of 5.4 per cent in 2017-18. Agriculture has 19 percent share in the GDP, while manufacturing contributes 20.6 percent and services 60.4 percent in GDP. The overall average growth during the last five years was 4.8 percent. On average, the Agriculture sector grew by 2.1 percent, large scale manufacturing by 4.7 percent and Services grew by 5.5 percent. The unemployment rate is on the decline, falling to 5.8 per cent in 2017-18, compared to 6.24 per cent in 2012-13.25 The proportion of informal workers in employment improved by 1.6 percentage points between 2014-15 and 2017-18. The proportion of children (aged 10-14 years) in employment also improved, from 8.6 per cent in 2014-15 to 7.5 per cent in 2017-18. The Government has affirmed renewed commitment to boosting trade, economic growth, jobs and safeguarding a decent standard of living for all. 
Pakistan has ratified all essential eight labour standards.  
Despite decline in the share of agriculture sector, this sector remains critical in achieving food security. A high population growth rate of 2.4 per cent, urbanization, nutrition needs and changing dietary preferences require a significant increase in crops, livestock and fish production, mainly by resource use intensification and productivity enhancement.  
Pakistan has made substantial progress in improving business climate in recent years: Starting a business, registering property is now easy. This has been achieved by streamlining and automating administrative procedures, and resolving insolvency issues easier. Integrated portal for online registration of company, getting construction permits, improved reliability, transparency and quality in getting electricity, registering property and contract enforcement, reduced procedures and time required in paying taxes and trading across borders and protection of legal rights of creditors and debtors in getting credit are the hallmark of new simplified system. 
The present government assigns high priority tourism development. This sector is dominated by private sector while public sector’s role is limited as a facilitator. Foreign visitors visiting Pakistan have increased three times since 2014.  
Vibrant financial sector is necessary for supporting growth. With the expansion of ICT, branchless banking has facilitated access to financial services. Improvement in financial inclusion leads to higher growth, increasing the access to start new startups, hence innovation which gives an opportunity that raises productivity and thus growth. 
The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) agreement – a USD 59 billion26 framework of regional connectivity – has created a large number of employment opportunities. Pakistan has also invested in several projects to support the CPEC initiative. CPEC infrastructure projects have begun to have a multiplier effect on overall employment creation and growth prospects. CPEC energy projects – centring on coal, solar, wind and hydropower – are helping to bridge critical energy shortages, benefitting industries and businesses.  Several Pakistani cities are now industrial hubs – including Sialkot, Gujranwala, Wazirabad, Gujrat, Hub, Faisalabad, Lahore and Karachi. Sialkot has been internationally recognized as a ‘world-class manufacturing hub’ for its productive business climate and entrepreneurial spirit. This small city accounts for 10-15 per cent of Pakistan’s total exports, specializing in leather, sporting goods and surgical instruments. It is also the world’s largest producer of hand-made footballs, accounting for 60 per cent of global production and supplying the official footballs used for the 2014 and 2018 FIFA World Cups. It is also the world’s largest manufacturing hub for surgical instruments .. Sialkot’s industries benefit from a clustering effect, where larger manufacturers liaise with smaller specialized industries, teaming up to complete export orders.

III. 	KEY INITIATIVES 
To make businesses ‘SDG-friendly’, a Responsible Business Framework was created in consultation with relevant stakeholders. Punjab’s government departments assess the impact of each public funded scheme on the SDGs, so that the province can prioritize schemes that best leverage private sector investment, solve energy constraints and develop modern infrastructure – all key areas for SDGs 8, 7 and 9. In collaboration with the Government of Pakistan, the Sialkot Chamber of Commerce & Industry (SCCI) established Sialkot International Airport, the first privately-owned public airport in the country to facilitate local exporters’ access to overseas markets. 
In line with international labour standards, Pakistan’s provinces are introducing laws and devising labour policies to implement these standards. Occupational safety and health (OSH), hours of work, minimum wages and social protection systems are being strengthened. Federal and provincial governments are conducting the child labour surveys that will ultimately support policy-making to end all forms of child labour. One major component of the recently launched poverty alleviation programme, ‘Ehsaas’, is ‘Mazdoor ka Ehsaas’ (compassion for labourers). Under this component, a Labour Expert Group is deliberating on ways to formalize Pakistan’s informal workers. Punjab has launched a door-to-door campaign in select districts to identify and register domestic workers, with a view to enabling their access to social protection.   
Through the Prime Minister’s Youth Skills Development Programme, almost 147,000 unemployed youths were trained in different demand-oriented trades. The Prime Minister’s National Internship Programme secured internships for 81,500 unemployed, educated youths in various public and private organizations. Further steps to increase productivity and promote decent work include: 
• a focus on getting children who are engaged in work into school, and creating make-shift schools close the workplaces of child labourers;  
• the creation of national incubation centres to promote entrepreneurship;  
• public investments in infrastructure projects to create employment opportunities;  
• prioritizing investments in energy projects to revive industries and generate employment;  
• implementing legislation on improved work conditions and increased minimum wage; • 	the revision of data collection tools to report on decent work, in line with SDG indicators; and  
• a special agreement with Qatar for the creation of 100,000 jobs for Pakistanis.  
IV. 	CHALLENGES AND LESSONS LEARNED  
There is a need to address the ‘skills mismatch’ between available skills among the labour force and market demands. This can be pursued by upgrading skills development in collaboration with the private sector, with a view to introducing in-demand skills and enhancing the work force’s productivity. Creating a Labour Market Information System would help to manage supply and demand issues, enabling skills development stakeholders to upgrade courses in response to market requirements. It is equally essential to address Pakistan’s low female labour force participation rate by creating a conducive environment for women’s employment, including through the provision of affordable transportation, day care facilities, flexible working hours, accommodation, and ensuring safe work environment.  There is also a need to respond to local and international demand for specific skills and align it to the local production of skilled human resources.  Pakistan’s experience points to the importance of improving labour productivity by investing in human capital, improving factories and machinery, providing on-the job training, ensuring appropriate safety measures, and ensuring job security and social security for all workers. Limited labour law enforcement may be addressed by strengthening the capacities of provincial labour departments, including through ICT solutions. Programmes should also be designed to enhance the coverage of labour laws, so that these also apply to informal workers. More needs to be done to create a conducive business environment in which small businesses and enterprises can thrive, as well as to build on cities’ potential for resource generation and employment. Access to finances for tourism sector needs to be enhanced manifold in view of the potential of the sector for employment promotion and revenue generation.  
	V. 	PRIORITIES AND TARGETS  
Pakistan’s target is to achieve a 5.8 per cent rate of economic growth in the next five years. To meet SDG 8’s target of sustainable growth, Pakistan needs to examine the investment climate and remove barriers to growth. Such growth requires greater investments in developing skilled human capital, demand-based skills development to enhance productivity, efforts to mitigate climate change, measures to support the ‘ease of doing business’, systems to document the economy, and creating secure, decent conditions for workers. The country plans to achieve these targets by upgrading technology, spearheading innovation and moving towards high value-added products that use labour intensive technologies which have already been prioritized in economic planning. Key priorities include: 
• exploring possibilities for enhancing growth in service sectors to absorb trained human resources, particularly in the ICT and tourism sector; 
• public investments in infrastructure projects under the CPEC initiative to boost the economy and generate employment; 
• establishing IT parks to enhance Pakistan’s capacity to become a hub for software and hardware; 
• transforming the labour market from one characterized by low productivity and low wages, to one marked by high productivity and high wages, through skills development; 
• pursuing international accreditation for Pakistani skills certifications and technical training so that foreign markets accept trained Pakistani workers; and  
• strengthening the agricultural sector, as it accounts for the greatest proportion of employment in the country.  
• Increase number of commercial bank accounts to 50 percent. 
• Provision of fiscal incentives (i.e. tax reliefs, subsidized loan financing etc.) to attract the private investment in tourism sector. 
• Development of archaeological sites and historical monuments as tourism products 
• Increase in international tourist arrival through removal of avoidable restrictions at the points of entry as well as movement of tourists to resort areas.  
VI. 	PLANNED INITIATIVES  
Notable initiatives planned for the coming years include:  
• developing highly-skilled, well-trained human resources while creating more quality employment opportunities through industrialization; 
• focusing on market-driven skills, particularly skills sets required for CPEC mega projects and in keeping with international market trends;  
• increasing women’s labour force participation by investing in skills development programmes, girls’ education and creating a conducive environment for women’s employment;  
• expanding broadband penetration, to increase it from low rates of 26 per cent in March 2018, to enable the overall digitization; 
• economy-wide digitization to promote tech-literacy to ensure that workers’ benefit from the growing importance of technologies for Pakistan’s economy; 
• harnessing prospects for software exports and potentially new export markets; 
• capitalizing on the potential of growth of the freelance sector from USD 1 billion to at least USD 5 billion; 
• broadening financial institutions access to population without bank accounts., supported by timely digitization; and 
• harnessing the potential of hospitality businesses and tourism. 
 	 

 GOAL 13 – CLIMATE ACTION 
 
	I. 	SDG 13 – AN OVERVIEW 
Pakistan is among the countries most affected by the impacts of climate change. This is manifested in recurrent, severe natural disasters – most prominently the cataclysmic Hindu Kush earthquake in 2005, devastating floods in 2010, 2011 and 2018, prolonged droughts and intense sporadic heat waves. Pakistan is experiencing high rates of deforestation, the loss of biodiversity, land degradation, soil erosion and desertification. As uncontrolled global patterns of economic production and consumption result in increased greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), prompting rising global temperatures, Pakistan is beset by the fallout of climate change. In comparison with other countries, Pakistan’s contribution in global carbon emissions is low, warranting appropriate compensation.  
II. 	PROGRESS, STATUS AND TRENDS 
The energy sector in Pakistan is the main contributor of greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for 51 per cent of total emissions. It is followed by the agricultural and livestock sectors, which contribute 39 per cent. Together, these sectors contribute 90 per cent of Pakistan’s total emissions. As a result of high population growth and urbanization, the country’s natural ecosystems are being degraded, while water and air quality are deteriorating. The loss of biodiversity also points to overstretched ecosystems, posing immense challenges for environmental and socio-economic sustainability.  
The average rate of deforestation between 2000 and 2005 was 2.1 per cent, due to weak governance mechanisms to halt deforestation. Forest cover has remained stagnant over the past decade, while land degradation is increasing at pace. Concerted efforts between 2013 and 2018 have resulted in progress in the country’s environmental and climate governance structure, as a result of several developments:  
• the implementation of the “Reducing Emission from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) preparedness” project;  
• the rehabilitation of nine irrigated plantations sites;  
• the amendment of the Forest Act 1927 to allow the private sector to establish companies for accelerating afforestation.  
III. 	KEY INITIATIVES 
Pakistan ratified the Paris Agreement in 2016 and accepted the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol. Pakistan’s Ministry of Climate Change (MoCC) revised the National Climate Change Policy of 2012 and the Framework for the Implementation of the Climate Change Policy in 2014 to align it with the international commitments. The Framework includes over 700 recommended actions, nearly 240 of which are considered priority actions, alongside 380 short-term, 108 medium-term and five long-term actions.  
As a country prone to natural disasters, including flash floods, Pakistan has established disaster management authorities at the national, provincial and district levels. These work to implement, coordinate and monitor disaster management activities. They provide technical expertise to assess vulnerabilities, mitigate disaster risks, manage impacts, and promote general awareness of disaster management. The country’s focus on disaster risk reduction (DRR) and disaster risk management (DRM) is a core feature of its partnership with the UN, as reflected in Outcome 6 (Resilience) of the United Nations Sustainable Development Programme for 
Pakistan 2018-2022. Pakistan revised the Biodiversity Action Plan for 2000 in 2016 and devised the National Forest Policy 2016 to protect and conserve the country’s natural resource base.  
In response to the challenge of deforestation, the Billion Tree Tsunami Afforestation Project in 2014 worked to restore depleted forests across 350,000 hectares of land, through tree planting (40 per cent) and natural regeneration (60 per cent). By fulfilling its goals in August 2017, many months ahead of schedule, Pakistan was the first Bonn Challenge pledge which not only reached its goal, but surpassed its commitment of 348,400 hectares. The project has set up around 13,000 private tree nurseries – safeguarding the environment, boosting local incomes, generating thousands of jobs and empowering women and youth in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.  
Following the success of the ‘Billion Tree Tsunami’ initiative in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the present Government launched the ‘Clean and Green Pakistan’ campaign. The initiative aims to make Pakistan pollution-free and counter the effects of climate change. The campaign will involve local communities’ participation, engage focal persons at the provincial level, establish a fully resourced WASH Strategic and Reforms Unit, and undertake regular strategic consultations with multiple stakeholders under eco-system restoration initiative of the present government as part of UN Decade of Eco-System Restoration (20202030). 
Following the success of the ‘Billion Tree Tsunami’ initiative in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the Government launched the ‘Clean and Green Pakistan’ campaign. The initiative aims to make Pakistan pollution-free and counter the effects of climate change. The campaign will involve local communities’ participation, engage focal persons at the provincial level, establish a fully resourced WASH Strategic and Reforms Unit, and undertake regular strategic consultations with multiple stakeholders. 
Pakistan has revived the Federal Forestry Board to provide strategic direction for the implementation of the 10 Billion Tree Tsunami Programme, which aims to involve all stakeholders in the next five years. The Clean and Green Pakistan Programme is engaging stakeholders in reviving flora across the country by planting 100 million indigenous tree species.  
The implementation of the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REED+) initiative has been converted into national monitoring system for forests. The conservation and protection of biodiversity has been a prime objective of the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP) 2015, which is being aligned with the strategic plan of the Convention of Biodiversity 2011-2020. Furthermore, the Ministry of Climate Change is implementing sustainable land management projects, focused on halting desertification and land degradation in arid and semi-arid parts of the country. 
MoCC is working on ‘Recharge Pakistan’ project for better management and utilization of flood waters to restore and re-charge the groundwater. The project is being developed on the successful flood management model of China. 
Pakistan has also secured funding (USD 37 million) for countering Glacier Lake Outburst Floods (GLOF-II) under the Green Climate Fund. These funds are being used to mitigate the impacts of floods in the upper Indus region, triggered by melting glaciers. Pakistan is prioritizing projects that pioneer climate smart livestock interventions, on-farm bio-energy generation, climate smart agriculture, improved resilience among farming communities and systems, the Pakistan Solar and Renewable Energy Project, waste-toenergy initiatives, and the conservation of mangrove ecosystems. 
IV. 	CHALLENGES AND LESSONS LEARNED  
High population growth is most serious threat to Pakistan’s future economic and environmental sustainability. It places additional burdens on existing resources and production processes, particularly in the agricultural sector. The proportion of the food insecure population is likely to increase in the wake of climate change, especially if anti-poverty measures do not expand access to food. Climate-related natural disasters are another major risk. As such, the Government is working to enhance the resilience of local communities to avert the adverse impacts of natural calamities. A low carbon path has financial implications worth between USD 8 and USD 17 billion per year towards 2050. Thus, Pakistan is working to increase the share of renewable energy in its energy supply mix. Upgrading technology to this end is the ultimate solution that Pakistan is working towards, with the help of partner countries and international organizations. 
	V. 	PRIORITIES AND TARGETS 
Pakistan is committed to adopt a low carbon trajectory and a pathway towards a ‘green economy’. The Climate Change Policy 2017 lays out adaptation and mitigation strategies to reinforce, improve and respond to emerging challenges. By integrating all three dimensions of sustainable development into Pakistan’s development paradigm, Pakistan aims to achieve the overarching goals of natural resource conservation, ecosystem and biodiversity protection, and climate change mitigation and adaptation.  
Pakistan’s priority is to implement policies for the sustainable management of ecosystems. These will aim to increase forest cover, combat desertification, protect biodiversity and conserve natural habitats. Specifically, the target is to increase forest cover by 1 percentage point – from 5.1 to 6.1 per cent – during the implementation of the 12th Five Year Plan. Protected areas for the conservation of wildlife, as a percentage of total land, is planned to be increased by 2 percentage points between 2017-18 and 2023. Environmental quality control measures will be introduced to monitor air and water quality, in line with the Government’s recently devised strategy to ensure compliance with air and water quality standards. 
The objectives of 12th Five Year Plan (2018-2023) clearly spell out the Government’s future priorities:  
• pursue economic growth by adequately mitigating and adapting to climate change impacts; 
• integrate climate change and the environment in development planning, projects, programmes and policies including the SDGs;  
• ensure sustainable forest management, biodiversity and wildlife conservation;  
• control air, noise, water and soil pollution and waste management;  
• launch awareness raising campaigns, enhance skills and institutional capacity of relevant stakeholders, including women. 
VI. 	PLANNED INITIATIVES 
Pakistan plans to reduce its current greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2030. Future mitigation strategies focus on reducing emissions in the energy and agriculture sectors. For the crop production and livestock sub-sectors, the Government will take advantage of available technologies to minimize waste and residuals. It will also introduce vehicular emission standards by phasing out old vehicles and adopting Euro 4 standards. Incentives will be provided to the manufacturing sector to produce commodities with a low carbon-foot print. Tax policies will be reviewed, exploring the possibility of introducing a ‘polluter tax’ to generate funds for climate-related mitigation and adaptation initiatives. Projects planned in the context of the 12th Five Year Plan will focus on the following thematic areas:  
• scaling up Glacial Lake Outburst Flood risk reduction in northern Pakistan;  
• transforming the country’s most vulnerable agricultural zones to climate smart agriculture; 
• integrated floodplains’ management; 
• ‘greening’ buildings; 
• livelihood improvements for Balochistan’s coastal communities;  
• conservation and restoration of mangrove ecosystem; and  
• rain water harvesting 
 
 
 
 

   GOAL 17 – PARTNERSHIPS FOR THE GOALS  
 
	I. 	SDG 17 – AN OVERVIEW 
Faced with the challenges of a trade imbalance, alongside a lack of foreign investment and domestic resource mobilization, Pakistan’s achievement of the SDGs relies on the accelerated implementation of SDG 17 in all its dimensions. This includes domestic resource mobilization complemented by international development assistance, cooperation and the promotion of technological transfer, improved trade relations and a boost in exports. It also requires capacity building to effectively implement national plans and frameworks, the resolution of systemic issues through policy coherence and partnerships, and transparent data, monitoring and accountability systems. All of these elements will work in cohesion to enable Pakistan to achieve all 17 SDGs. The Government recognizes that improving governance will improve public service delivery and enhance the efficiency of public institutions. The country’s future governance model will be based on equity and equality. According to existing arrangements and the distribution of responsibilities between Pakistan’s federating units, provincial governments are responsible for many functions related to public service delivery at the grassroots level.  As a result, Pakistan has prioritized multi-stakeholder partnerships across the country, with a focus on macroeconomic and fiscal stabilization through a renewed commitment to implement fundamental reforms. 
II. 	PROGRESS, STATUS AND TRENDS 
Pakistan has made consistent progress on promoting partnerships, with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) the most significant international initiative for the country. A comprehensive framework of regional connectivity, CPEC not only benefits socio-economic growth prospects in both countries is expected to generate positive spill overs in the broader region. Over the past five years, trade between the two countries has grown rapidly, at an average of 18.8 per cent.27 Bilateral investments have also increased, and China is now the largest foreign capital investor in Pakistan. Improved on-the-ground linkages of road, rail, and air transport is encouraging the free and frequent exchange of human resources, enhancing the volume of trade and business, and increasing the demand for the regional exchange of academic and cultural knowledge.  
Pakistan is simultaneously pursuing to develop multi-stakeholder partnerships to create and share the knowledge, financial resources, expertise and technologies needed to achieve the SDGs. Cross-sectoral partnerships are being implemented at the federal and provincial levels, drawing together all tiers of government alongside civil society, the private sector, academia, international organizations – including UN agencies – donors and communities to localize, design and implement paths towards achieving the SDGs. Pakistan’s provinces have each launched governance reform agendas to improve service delivery, focusing on transparency and access, results-based management and resource mobilization. The Punjab Information Technology Board (PITB) uses technology to modernize governance and improve citizens’ digital literacy.  The Doing Business Reform Plan is also being implemented to support businesses and start-ups, with a view to improving the investment climate. Sindh’s public sector reform initiative aims to mobilize revenues through an overhaul of tax policy, by improving administrative efficiency and by enhancing the performance of the public financial management and procurement system. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, police reforms have been the linchpin of the Government’s efforts. These involve increasing quotas for women in the police to 10 per cent, forming women-only police stations and Women Complaint Cells in other selected stations. The Citizen Feedback Model (CFM) is another important reform adopted across the province, which collects users’ feedback on the quality of public services accessed. In Balochistan, the Governance Support Project, implemented in partnership with academia, aims to improve the capacity of public officials in project management, monitoring and evaluation, appraisal, financial management and procurement. In addition, citizens in remote areas are being assisted to lodge complaints against corruption. 
The Sindh Development Forum (SDF) is one of the most prominent examples of partnerships taking root across the country to push for sustainable, equitable change that leaves no one behind. Comprising a range of cross-sectoral stakeholders, the forum has developed a framework of cooperation in the province of Sindh for the next ten years. The framework prioritizes partnerships across nine themes in key socio-economic sectors, including education, health, and water and sanitation.  
Pakistan is also promoting partnerships that focus on technological progress, supported by information and communications technology (ICT) usage. In early 2019, Pakistan’s ‘tele-density’ stood at 77 per cent of the population. An estimated 32 per cent of population have access to the internet – an enormous increase compared to the past decade.28

KEY INITIATIVES 
Key partnerships to meet the needs of the ‘furthest behind first’, in line with the SDGs’ overarching aims, include the SDG model taluka (a smaller administrative unit) in Islamkot, in the district of Tharparkar, Sindh. Tharparkar is one of the province’s (and the country’s) most deprived districts; 87 per cent of its population is multidimensional deprived. The Government identified Islamkot, one of the district’s talukas  and has worked to develop it as a model SDG taluka in partnership with non-government stakeholders and the private sector. A comprehensive plan to localize and implement the SDGs has been developed in the taluka. Areas of cooperation include education, healthcare, livelihoods and skills, infrastructure, water, gender equality and disaster management.  
Pakistan is also moving towards opening up economically to the rest of the world, while leveraging trade opportunities in the region and beyond. The European Union (EU) has granted duty-free access to 96 per cent of Pakistani exports to the EU through the Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP+). This preferential tariff has helped Pakistani products to enter the EU market, as well as to sustain their share in it. This means that Pakistani products, such are textiles and garments which had been facing stiff competition, are finding it easier to access the EU market. Pakistan is also working to boost trade and tourism by enhancing productivity and opening its physical borders. To this end, an e-visa facility is available to 175 countries, while a visa-on-arrival facility has been extended to 50 countries in order to promote tourism nationwide.   Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Cells have been established to promote and facilitate partnerships through knowledge management and policy advice on project financing. Budgetary processes, including development funding, have been aligned for PPP financing based on an assessment of development portfolios and annual budgets.  
Significant technological initiatives include the creation of the National Incubation Centre and the SDGs Tech Lab, which provide capacity support to the Federal Bureau of Revenue (FBR), Pakistan’s revenue collection agency, and the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), its data collection agency. 
IV. 	CHALLENGES AND LESSONS LEARNED  
In order to accelerate the implementation of the SDGs, the Government is prioritizing innovative solutions on 
SDG 17 to serve all other goals. In addition to the lessons learned from the SDG model Taluka Islamkot, PPP Cells, trade and technological initiatives, Pakistan is also capitalizing on non-traditional partnerships with the private sector, leveraging their expertise to address development issues. 
Implementing the SDGs requires ambitious financing. As such, Pakistan is working to mobilize domestic resources and private sector financing to meet these needs. Pakistan has also benefited from international development assistance, specifically Official Development Assistance (ODA), and partnerships with the UN. Nevertheless, a consistent and reliable supply of international financial aid flows will be much-needed to capitalize on Pakistan’s preparedness to achieve the SDGs.  
	V. 	PRIORITIES AND TARGETS 
Governance reforms are a top priority agenda. Strengthening public institutions and the rule of law are the basis for restructuring efforts. The country’s objective is to ensure that public institutions are free of political and other covert pressures. This reform process is spread across a range of issues – including performance evaluation, service delivery, the civil service, judicial systems and procedures, tax administration, procurement, financial management, policing, e-governance, property rights, and public sector enterprises.  Pakistan aims to improve prioritized indicators under SDG 17. These include remittances, a major contributor to the economy. The target is that these will increase to 10 per cent of GDP29 from the current 7 per cent by improving the quality of human resources and decreasing the costs of sending remittances from abroad back to Pakistan.  
Another priority is improving domestic resource mobilization. Overall, the country’s tax collection potential estimated at 26 per cent of GDP. The target is to reach 18 per cent by 2030. To this end, the Government’s national revenue collection authority will be granted financial, managerial and operational authority. This will also allow the country to generate enough resources to finance 80 per cent of its domestic budget30, complemented by a higher national savings rate.  
VI. 	PLANNED INITIATIVES 
Planned initiatives include a reform roadmap for the Federal Bureau of Revenue (FBR). Based on ICT platforms to create an efficient interface between tax payers and tax collectors, this initiative aims to evoke revenue acceleration through reforms, a revamped tax policy, the separation of policy and administration functions, and the digitization of processes. 
The Ministry of Planning, Development & Reform is developing a Responsible Business Framework through a multi-stakeholder consultation process. A working group is simultaneously exploring innovative financing avenues, with a view to freeing up public funds where private sector investments are possible. 
Pakistan has also enacted a new Digital Policy, under which avenues for international collaboration are being explored to promote research and innovation on all the SDGs. Specifically, this will involve the development of infrastructure promoted by National Incubation Centres targeting SDGs 9 (‘Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure’) and 11 (‘'Sustainable Cities and Communities'’). It will also support human resources and entrepreneurship, thereby to SDGs 5 (‘Gender Equality’), 8 (‘Decent Work and Economic Growth’), 1 (‘No Poverty’) and 4 (‘Quality Education’). A focus will also be placed on exporting software, manufacturing hardware locally, and enabling the delivery of public services through ICT. 
Under CPEC, Pakistan will explore key areas of cooperation to accelerate growth combined with regional development, expanding trade and transport, and boosting economic interaction across Central Asia, South Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Europe. By 2030, this partnership is expected to have a robust sustainable economic growth mechanism in place, based on an integrated transport system, information network infrastructure, energy development and transmission, and special economic zones (SEZ). 
The Government is taking up a planned reform agenda for strengthening the local government system, improving the implementation of public sector development programmes to ensure regional equality, improving the monitoring and evaluation system, upholding the rule of law, and enhancing corporate governance. These objectives can only be achieved by strengthening Pakistan’s legal and regulatory framework, the capacity building of public functionaries, and civil service reforms.  



5 HLPF THEMATIC ANALYSIS  
To measure existing disparities and the extent of uneven development, the country’s Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) was developed in 2016. This sheds light on social, economic and geographical inequalities at the national, provincial and district levels. It also shows the impact of successive governments’ policies and programmes on reducing different types of inequalities across Pakistan. Based on MPI estimates at district level, the Government is focusing on specific, targeted interventions in particular districts. Spatial analysis of the provision of education, healthcare, water supplies and access to sanitation, electricity and fuel for cooking, has supported efforts to set baselines for SDG indicators. All of these efforts assist the design and implementation of policies for more inclusive growth, the equitable distribution of resources and sustainable development for all. 
Pakistan is moving towards a more pluralistic society, where the voices from the ‘margins’ both influence and shape public policy. Different actors are contributing to raising awareness of critical issues that limit social development and the trickle-down-impact of economic growth. Democratic institutions in Pakistan are instrumental for making decision-making processes more inclusive and participatory. The of national and provincial assemblies now include greater representation of women, minorities and underdeveloped areas. Information channels available to the public have multiplied as the country’s print and electronic media enjoy greater freedom and independence, with minimal surveillance by the state apparatus. Civil society organizations (CSOs) are playing an active role in highlighting a range of issues related to the SDGs – from economic development to social injustice.  
To strengthen democratic values in the governance system, grassroots participation has been ensured through local government institutions. The present Government’s top priority is to make decision-making more participatory and inclusive by revamping local institutions. Therefore, the Prime Minister constituted a committee to restructure Pakistan’s current local government system, under Article 140-A of the Constitution. The overarching goal of this restructuring process is to transfer power to stakeholders at the grassroots level, thereby enabling their engagement and empowerment.  
Pakistan’s principle resource distribution mechanism is based on the ‘population share’ 82 per cent while the remaining 18 per cent is allocated on the basis of poverty/backwardness (10.3 per cent), revenue collection/generation (5 per cent) and inverse population density (2.7 per cent). Allocations on the basis of poverty/backwardness have led to improvements in the provision of basic infrastructure in underdeveloped areas. The Multi-dimensional Poverty Index (MPI) – in its assessment of three core spheres of deprivation, namely education, health and living standards – improved by 10.5 percentage points between 2008-09 and 2014-15.  
The Constitution of Pakistan guarantees education as a fundamental right for all citizens under Article 25-A. Accordingly, the state is responsible for providing free and compulsory education to all children between the ages of five and 16. Despite a continuous increase in budgetary allocations for the education after 2010 – when the 18th Constitutional Amendment ‘devolved’ responsibility for key social sectors such as education to the provinces – this increase has not had the desired results. Pakistan’s Gender Parity Index (GPI) at the primary and secondary education levels remained at 0.8 in 2014-15. While access to education facilities has improved significantly in the past 20 years, net primary enrolment rates have not improved substantially. In response to the current state of education, the Supreme Court of Pakistan declared an ‘education emergency’. This primarily aims to ensure a uniform education system, quality education, the enrolment of out-of-school children and skills development. To harness the potential of Pakistan’s youth, the Government has taken a number of steps to empower talented, albeit less privileged, youth. Key initiatives include the Prime Minister’s Youth Skills Training Programme, the Technical and Vocational Education and Training 
55
(TVETA) Programme, the National Endowment Scholarships for Talent (NEST) and the Tuition Fee Reimbursement Programme.  
The sluggish pace of economic growth over the last decade, coupled with high population growth rate of 2.4 per cent per year, contributed significantly to the slow growth of per capita income in Pakistan. Nevertheless, despite high levels of population growth, Pakistan has increased per capita income to a level that has contributed to a steadily decline in poverty since 2005-06.  
Despite the challenges of addressing multi-faceted inequalities, the Government has displayed resilience by implementing policies and programmes to reduce existing gaps. Key policy initiatives undertaken to stabilize the economy include the recent IMF programme, reforms in tax collection, a reduction in subsidies, moves to rationalize utility charges and incentives for domestic investors.  
Pakistan is striving to ensure a decent work environment for its labour force, particularly women and persons with disabilities. To assess the magnitude of child labour and to effectively enforce policies eradicate child labour, a national survey is underway. To encourage women’s labour force participation, the Government has created quotas for jobs, particularly managerial positions, with a view to promoting gender equality. Climate change is the most pressing challenge for the sustainability of Pakistan’s food, water and energy sectors – the three main drivers of the economy. Pakistan is the seventh31 most at risk country from the adverse impacts of climate change, despite its low carbon footprint. Climate change is also one of the major contributors to gender inequality and spatial inequalities, as women bear a disproportionate share of climateinduced vulnerabilities. Pakistan’s agro-climatic zones are suffering from acute variations in temperatures, harming the livelihoods of great swathes of the population. To address these inequities, a National Climate Change Policy and implementation framework were developed. Recognizing the severity of climate change, the Prime Minister constituted the Prime Minister’s Committee on Climate Change (PMCCC). The Committee has been instrumental in launching programs like ’10 Billion Tree’ drive aims to plant 10 Billion trees across the country over the next 5 years; the Glacial Lake outbursts floods program; and climate resilient urban settlements amongst others. The Clean and Green Pakistan Campaign was launched by the Prime Minister himself in Oct 2018 to fight pollution and global warming.  
The Government has explicitly focused on empowering people in need by building knowledge systems. These include, for instance, the provision of internet facilities in remote locations and enhancing mobile phone coverage. The country’s information and communications technology (ICT) policy encourages the private sector to invest in improving virtual connectivity for all the people in Pakistan. As a result, mobile phones have become a tool for the empowerment of the poor women and those living in remote areas. Overall, the Government of Pakistan’s development planning, policies and programmes are increasingly focusing on inclusivity, equity and empowering people. It is further exploring innovative solutions for transforming conventional economic approaches to knowledge-based economy and ensuring sustainable economic development while exploiting the youth dividend. It is estimated that the government’s new initiative like the Naya Pakistan Housing Project, the 10 billion tree drive and the implementation of National Financial Inclusion Strategy shall help generate opportunities for the 10 million youth population who are expected to enter the labor market over the next five years. The 12th Five Year Plan (2018-23) offers a balanced and equitable regional allocation ensuring unprecedent development of underperforming areas for a sustainable impact. 150,000 youth will be trained annually through the Prime Minister’s Skill Development Program enhancing their employability opportunities.

6 MEANS OF IMPLEMENTATION 
6.1 INSTITUTIONAL MECHANISM FOR THE SDGS 
Pakistan has set-up a multi-tier institutional coordination mechanism to advance progress on the SDGs, encompassing governmental and non-governmental stakeholders. The National Initiative on the Sustainable Development Goals has been launched – a dedicated initiative for institutionalizing the 2030 Agenda with the objective of bolstering the Government’s role as the central coordinating entity of major stakeholders to leverage partnerships for development. In parallel, all four provinces and three federally administered areas have created SDG Support Units within their P&DDs. These SDG Support Units are working closely with government counterparts and other stakeholders to improve coordination among all tiers of government and non-governmental actors. They provide technical support to government agencies (ministries and departments), including statistical offices, and liaise with the private sector, civil society and international organizations. A project board chaired by Secretary PD&R with representatives from the federal and provincial P&DDs and SDG units has been constituted at national level among the SDG Support units. 
 
 
Technical Committees, Clusters and Core Groups have been notified in the provinces comprising experts, government representatives, the private sector and non-government stakeholders to guide the process of achieving the SDGs. These expert groups are called upon to deliberate on issues related to the SDGs, and to help the Government to develop or improve plans, policies and programmes for achieving the goals.  
i. In Punjab, an Advisory Council has been constituted to oversee the prioritization and sequencing of the SDGs. It has since finalized provincial baselines and targets for the SDGs. Representatives from different sectors are part of the Council, which is supported by four Cluster Groups, formed to address social, economic, environmental, inclusivity and governance issues. These ensure horizontal and vertical policy coherence for designing Punjab’s SDG Prioritization Framework, as well as the implementation of programmes and projects. 
ii. Sindh has established a Provincial Technical Committee (PTC) to guide the mainstreaming of the SDGs. In tandem, a Core Group advises on localizing the goals and formulating the province’s SDG Prioritization Framework. Six additional Core Groups have been notified on different thematic areas to steer implementation efforts – specifically on health, education, agriculture, livestock & fisheries, local government and public health engineering, the environment & energy and corresponding subcommittees have also been formed.  
iii. Balochistan has notified a Provincial Technical Committee (PTC) to steer the localization of the goals and advise the SDG Support Unit. In addition, five Thematic Committees have been formed on employment generation and management, water, energy and the environment, health, agriculture and education. District Coordination Committees on the SDGs will help to align the province’s Comprehensive Development and Growth Strategy 2018-2024 with the goals. 
iv. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Provincial Technical and Steering Committee is actively involved in mainstreaming the SDGs in the province, and oversees the localization of specific goals. 
v. The P&DD in AJ&K has established four Thematic Working Groups on the SDGs, with members from the government, academia, civil society, youth and the private sector. These working groups meet periodically to take stock of progress on the SDGs in the administrative area.

Pakistan recognizes that transforming the 2030 Agenda into a reality on the ground depends on local champions and effective horizontal coordination at the national level. SDG focal persons have been nominated by the MoPD&R, in collaboration with other federal ministries and specialized federal agencies for   effective communication and information sharing. The group meets monthly to discuss progress, identify needs and suggest actions for the country’s SDG Units. Provincial governments have followed this lead. For example, Punjab has nominated the district administrator (Deputy Commissioner) in each of its 36 districts as the focal person on the SDGs. Punjab has also constituted District SDG Committees for the implementation of the goals at the grassroots level. Balochistan and KP is engaged in a similar process. KP has set up a District Performance Management Framework, through which district authorities are evaluated using an online monitoring system. These efforts are important to prepare the lowest tier of government to align their development efforts with the 2030 Agenda. 
6.2 LOCALIZING THE GOALS   
6.2.1 Advocacy and awareness 
The nature of the 2030 Agenda – universal, transformative and rights-based – directs the transition of the global goals into national, provincial and regional priorities. 
Government 
Recognizing that sensitizing public officials is necessary towards the localization of the SDGs, the MoPD&R organized Local Government Summit in the federal capital, Islamabad, in March 2017. Its objective was to initiate a dialogue among local government representatives – elected representatives and office holders – to share their insights on various aspects of the SDGs. Local government leaders, both Chairpersons and Deputy Chairpersons, from 75 districts deliberated on their understanding of the 2030 Agenda, and the challenges they foresee to its implementation in Pakistan.  
The MoPD&R also organized workshops in divisional headquarters to sensitize various stakeholders on the SDG framework and the use of the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) for planning, budgeting, measuring performance and improved targeting.  
In addition, several awareness raising sessions for government officials and parliamentarians were periodically conducted across the country with a view to mainstreaming the SDGs. The Pakistan Institute of Parliamentary Services (PIPS) organized multiple sessions on the goals for Parliamentary Taskforces. The Government recognizes that such efforts are continuously required to maintain the momentum required to achieve the SDGs. To reach out to remote areas, additional efforts are also underway to ensure that no one is left behind. 
A Strategic Foresight Workshop in Balochistan brought together a wide range of stakeholders, including senior government officials, to explore innovative, participatory strategic planning, policy formulation and solution design methods for the SDGs. A multi-stakeholder workshop in the province highlighted the need for integrating the SDGs into agriculture and natural resource management for effective public planning. A development network has also engaged leading civil society organizations (CSOs) to create synergies around mutual objectives related to the SDGs. 
Civil society organizations (CSO) 
The federally administered areas of Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir have made special efforts to reach out communities at the grassroots level in order to inform efforts to localize the SDGs. Several organizations in Gilgit-Baltistan, for instance, are working to strengthen local support organizations (LSOs) and community-based organizations (CBOs) by engaging citizens from multiple ethnic, linguistic and economic backgrounds to discuss the global SDG framework. These stakeholders identified education (SDG 4) as their top priority followed by health (SDG 3), infrastructure (SDG 9), poverty (SDG 1) and gender equality (SDG 5). 

Box 3: Citizens’ engagement and perceptions on the SDGs 
A comprehensive citizens’ engagement activity was conducted in 42 districts, in collaboration with a civil society organization that works to improve the socioeconomic status of those in need. This activity gathered the perceptions of diverse segments of society, including women, youth, the elderly, persons with disabilities (PWDs) and transgender people. Such civil society stakeholder engagement sessions were conducted across all four provinces, as well as in Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir. The activities used a comprehensive questionnaire Pakistan’s priority SDGs, developed by a nationallevel working group. It drew on inputs from organizations working with persons with disabilities, transgender people and women, as well as those working on quality education for all, social protection and gender equality, local government engagement, youth empowerment and social inclusion. Over 1,200 diverse participants shared their insights on the SDGs, focusing on initiatives taken and challenges ahead. Of the participants, 102 were members of minority groups and 86 were persons with disabilities. On average, 35 per cent of participants believed that the Government had made significant efforts to improve education (SDG 4) in their districts, as did 24 per cent in relation to health (SDG 3). Few participants believed that interventions have been taken to foster responsible consumption and production (SDG 12), partnerships (SDG 17) and clean energy (SDG 7). Participants successfully identified factors that may impede the achievement of the SDGs, including a lack of awareness on the goals, a lack of resources, and limited access to health and education.  
Such consultative sessions served two overarching purposes. First, they represent an independent review by civil society of Pakistan’s preparedness to achieve the 2030 Agenda. Second, they allow the Government to receive feedback on priority SDG areas, as identified at the grassroots level. 
In Sindh, CSO-led initiatives on the SDGs were mapped to develop an effective forum that can continuously support the Government. CSOs and non-governmental organizations in Punjab have published policy briefs to sensitize policy-makers and citizens, raise awareness and generate crosssectoral discourse on sustainable development. Consultative sessions on SDG 16 (‘Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions’) were hosted by CSOs and youth organizations in Punjab, based on the MAPS approach.  
In Islamabad Capital Territory, local and international NGOs often host clean-ups drives to raise awareness of the 2030 Agenda. The district government of the city has supported civil society organizations to highlight issues of urban forest, air and land pollution, watersheds and waste management, as well as their campaigns for improving health and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH). Recognizing the important role that youth can play in disseminating the SDGs’ core messages to the public at large, young people have been sensitized through seminars at academic campuses, hosted by a youth organization’s SDG Volunteer Ambassadors Programme.  
Academia 
specific SDGs – such as tree planting, controlling pollution and awareness raising.  In line with the concept of ‘sustainability and waste management’, many campuses have restricted the use of plastic bags, while encouraging the use of paper or cloth bags instead. Some provincial Education Directorates are considering including lessons on the goals in school curricula to prepare young children for the 2030 Agenda. 
Private sector  
There is considerable room to catalyse the private sector to create mass awareness on the SDGs in Pakistan. Academia in Pakistan increasingly participates in activities related to the SDGs’ localization, research, advocacy and implementation. A series of awareness raising and knowledge sharing sessions have been held by various universities. Plans are underway to engage universities’ human resources on research for, and the implementation of the SDGs, particularly in terms of monitoring and evaluation (M&E). Moreover, a number of academic institutions have been set up to engage university students in research on community-level related to any of the SDGs. Such institutions also reach out to schools and colleges to educate younger students on the SDGs, highlighting interlinkages, promoting behavioural change for the SDGs and encouraging volunteerism. For instance, they engage youths in activities to promote a sense of civic responsibilities on issues critical for achieving In Sindh, a consultative session with leading private sector entities took stock of the resources spent by the private sector on achieving the 2030 Agenda, using a Corporate Philanthropy Survey Tool.32 The survey found that 82 per cent of companies are aware of the SDGs, almost all realize that they must contribute towards them, and 55 per cent have taken practical steps to align their activities with priority targets.  
The research arm of Pakistan’s large businesses organization, a major private sector advocacy forum, has taken steps to improve understandings of the 2030 Agenda among private sector experts. In collaboration with partners, the forum encouraged companies to identify action points and consolidate information on their work on the SDGs, including an effort to adopt the goals within their brand strategies.   
A two-day ‘SDG Hack-athon’ was organized in 2017 by the National Incubation Centre, a public-private partnership, to address the innovation gap between the public and private sectors. It encouraged participants to create prototype solutions to address civic and social problems that contribute to achieving the SDGs. The centre is also conducting ‘National SDG Boot-camps’ – advocacy and training platforms for social entrepreneurs and change-makers to accelerate the impact of their activities, so as to fast-track progress on the goals. 
Development Partners 
Development partners, particularly UN agencies, have contributed to Pakistan’s journey towards the SDGs’ implementation. 
                                                                
Box 4: Current status of disability in Pakistan  
The Pakistan Disability Perspective Report was an important contribution to discourse related to the SDGs. The prevalence of disability stands at 8 per cent and ‘disabilities’ in the plural (all categories – severe, and mild to moderate) at 12 per cent.  
Several civil society organizations in Pakistan work to improve access to education for children with disabilities, including by enhancing funding for them in mainstream education, the capacity building of education professionals to promote inclusive education, and by increasing learning materials that support inclusive education programmes. Pakistan aims to refocus education policy to include disability as a cross-cutting theme, to revise budgets to include improving physical infrastructure for children with disabilities, and to establish a formal disability and educational needs assessment process at all sub-national levels. Organizations are required to implement a ‘disability quota’, which stipulates that persons with disabilities should comprise at least 2 per cent of an organization’s employees. Requirements also prescribe the elimination of discrimination against women with disabilities and seek to improve data on disability in labour force statistics. Government- and private sector-led programmes have increased training for persons with disabilities, in order to prepare them with the skills needed to participate in the labour market. The Government is also making it easier for differently-abled persons to join the civil service. The Federal Public Service Commission (FPSC) ensures that persons with disabilities can apply and be selected for all occupational groups. Recently, a visually impaired young man has joined the superior civil services as a civil judge posted in Lahore, Punjab. 

They have provided significant technical support, particularly for localizing, baseline setting and integrating the SDGs in provincial plans. The Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) has also benefited from such support to upgrade the country’s data collection tools.  
Communication Platforms 
Pakistan believes that the use of ICT is key to gaining momentum on the 2030 Agenda. The MoPD&R and provincial P&DDs have launched dedicated websites exclusively on the SDGs. The Federal Government and the Government of Punjab are maintaining these websites. A dedicated module is included on the website of the P&DD of AJ&K. Social media platforms are also being used to disseminate information, updates on the 2030 Agenda, to seek the public’s support on implementation, and gain feedback on policies and programmes. Pakistan has translated the global framework into the national language (Urdu), as well as into braille for the blind and into sign language for the deaf, to ensure that the message of the SDGs is accessible to all. 
In addition AJ&K has appointed ‘SDG Ambassadors’ in each district. Balochistan has utilized radio and billboards to spread the message, while the national television has released district-level short documentaries in local languages. One radio programme featured Balochistan’s provincial SDGs Unit to advance youth and community engagement through story-telling. The provinces of Punjab and Sindh both used radio and television, while simultaneously developing and disseminating infographics and thematic documentaries on priority goals. Pakistan’s provinces are also developing a web-based ‘SDG Speak’ series to share insights.  
6.2.2 Mainstreaming and institutionalizing SDGs in public planning 
Since adopting the 2030 Agenda in 2016, the Government of Pakistan has taken three important steps to mainstreaming the SDGs in public planning:  
i. Institutionalization: Provincial and administrative area growth strategies reflect each federating unit’s respective development priorities. These are a useful guide, offering a prioritization tool to rank the SDGs. This tool has been used to review different policies, their theoretical underpinnings and empirical findings in three broad stages: 
a. Mapping targets in five exclusive themes; 
b. Identifying and quantifying relative criteria at the goal-level; and 
c. Prioritizing targets through systematic numeric ranking.  
A comprehensive and technical methodology was used to devise the Pakistan’s National SDG Framework, which will guide future development strategies for the 2030 Agenda. As discussed above in the Introduction and Chapter 5, the SDG targets were prioritized using a seven-dimensional criterion – width, depth, multiplier, urgency, requirement of lower structural change, the need for lower finances, and relevance for all provinces. The framework is based on five critical pathways (CPW) that can converge to reduce regional inequalities by fostering inclusive, sustainable development: 
• CPW1: Improve governance and security; 
• CPW2: Increase access to quality social and municipal services; 
• CPW3: Increase investment, employment and productivity in key sectors and improve economic growth; 
• CPW4: Improve environmental stewardship and climate action; and  
• CPW5: Reduce inequalities and improve social cohesion. 
The targets in the framework were ranked as ‘high’, ‘medium-high’, ‘medium-low’ and ‘low’. Rankings were then mapped back to each SDG. The goals were further classified into three categories, as discussed in the introduction, each requiring continuous policy and budgetary support. Until provincial prioritization frameworks are finalized, consultation on the national framework will continue. The framework is a living document that sets the tone for the provinces to design their own frameworks, based on their unique development priorities 
Provincial SDG prioritization frameworks also follow the five CPWs as their building blocks. Using the cluster approach, Punjab has formulated its prioritization framework, based on a review of provincial development policies and plans from the perspective of responsiveness, identifying provincial priorities, analysing statistical monitoring and reporting capacities, and setting baselines and targets. The Punjab Sustainable Development Strategy is also under review to align it with the 2030 Agenda. Balochistan, Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are working on their respective SDG prioritization frameworks, which are expected to be completed in 2019.  
ii. Project preparation: PC-I is an important tool used for project planning in Pakistan. The Ministry of Planning, Development & Reform has agreed to align the PC-I template with the SDGs. To this end, a format has been suggested to a committee for their approval. Once approved, it will be possible to analyse project proposals from various ministries at the planning stage vis-à-vis their alignment with the SDGs. Moreover, the Federal SDG Section engages with various technical and economic sections in the Ministry, with a view to aligning development and economic planning with the 2030 Agenda. A similar exercise has been undertaken by the provinces when preparing their plans, for example the Balochistan Comprehensive Development Growth Strategy 2013-2020, the Punjab Sustainable Development Strategy, the Sindh Growth Strategy and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Sustainable Development Strategy 2018-23. Azad Jammu and Kashmir’s 12th Five-Year Plan has also been linked with the SDGs. 
iii. Localization plans: The provinces of Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan have accelerated their localization efforts by each selecting two pilot districts with low MPI scores33 and designing localized development plans for these districts. The aim is to bring these underdeveloped districts at par with more developed districts in the respective province. Goal-specific localization plans have also been rolled out for SDG 3 (‘Good Health and Well-Being’), based on provincial and administrative area-level consultations.  
6.3 MONITORING AND REPORTING MECHANISMS 
6.3.1 Data Ecosystem  
In the summer of 2018, Pakistan launched its ‘Data Reporting Gaps Analysis’ study – a stepping stone for monitoring and reporting on progress towards the SDGs. The exercise outlined the country’s data ecosystem vis-à-vis reporting needs and can assist in determining baselines and targets. It began with a desk review of national and provincial surveys, as well as of data collected by international agencies and government institutions. This review was followed by a series of consultations with the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), the National Institute of Population Studies (NIPS), UN agencies, civil society, the private sector, federal ministries and line departments.  
Each SDG indicator was analysed for the efforts required to report on its relevant target. Relative levels of effort were based on the global tier system, devised by the Inter-Agency Expert Group (IAEG). Overall, out of 244 indicators, discounting global indicators, Pakistan will be able to report progress on half of the SDG indicators. While discussions on some of these indicators are on-going in terms of their definition or calculation methodology, the ‘remaining half’ require major efforts.  
 
These include additional financing, consultations with relevant agencies, institutional coordination and carrying out new surveys. The data ecosystem in Pakistan fares reasonably well in terms of capturing the inclusion and equity aspects of the SDGs. However, sustainability aspects require substantial improvement, specifically in terms of indicators on natural resources, biodiversity, urban life, climate change, peace and justice. One outcome of the ‘Data Reporting Gaps Analysis’ study was the identification of responsible ministries and agencies for collecting data, computing indicators and reporting on progress. Multistakeholder consultations conducted for the analysis also assisted in pinpointing preferred sources of data.  Pakistan’s provinces and administrative areas have used this process to take stock of the data available to them, as well as reporting needs. Azad Jammu and Kashmir has identified 32 line departments that must align their activities with SDG targets and report progress at the state level. Punjab’s data gap analysis reviewed existing data reporting mechanisms, including surveys and management information systems (MIS). Given the province’s strong data collection and management system, Punjab will be able to monitor progress on most indicators at the provincial and district levels mainly through the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) that has been carried out regularly at the district level.  Similarly, Sindh has identified where it will report progress on the SDGs at the provincial or district levels. Overall, the data gap study has been extremely helpful in revealing variations in data availability across the provinces – identifying variations, moreover, will help to address them. 
6.3.2 Data Gathering Tools 
Survey instruments have been updated by federal and provincial statistical agencies to align them with new data requirements. Several specialized surveys have either been completed, or are on-going, to report progress on several indicators, such as maternal mortality, functional literacy, crime reporting and safety.  Provincial statistical units, such as the Bureau of Statistics of Punjab, have revised the definitions of some of their indicators in line with the SDGs, while including indicators like the maternal mortality ratio, functional literacy, crime reporting and safety in its latest provincial MICS for the first time (past of the nationally coordinated MICS mentioned above). Punjab has also launched new surveys for reporting on SDG 3 indicators within the scope of the Punjab Health Survey, and on SDG 5 based on the Home-Based Workers Survey. The Government of Gilgit-Baltistan has made strides in transitioning from paper-based systems to electronic systems of monitoring progress. They have established a District Health Management Information System (HMIS) and a Monitoring & Surveillance System to assess the quality of drinking water from all water sources. They have also upgraded their education monitoring systems to an electronic Education Management Information System (EMIS). 
Pakistan will use a range of data to report progress on the SDGs – encompassing primary data, published secondary data, or unpublished secondary data. Several national surveys are conducted for providing primary data, while utilizing robust research methodologies and scientific data analysis techniques. The data Is published and widely disseminated for utilization by different stakeholders. These include Agriculture Census, Business Register, Census of Agriculture Machinery, Census of Manufacturing Industries (CMI), Household Integrated Economic Survey (HIES), Labour Force Survey (LFS), Multiple Indicators Clusters Survey (MICS) (at the provincial level), National Education Census, National Nutritional Survey, Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey (PDHS), Pakistan Social and Living Standard Measurement (PSLM); and Population Census. 
To collect primary data for reporting progress on the SDGs, robust coordination among national and provincial statistical organizations is in place. The PSLM will be the primary source for reporting progress. Based on lessons learned from the analysis of data reporting gaps, data collection instruments in existing surveys have been updated. As a result, Pakistan’s surveys will be able to report on progress towards the maximum possible number of indicators, with minimum additional efforts or resources. Pakistan has also attempted to make primary data more representative of on-the-ground realities and broaden its scope to include under-represented segments of the society, in order to leave no one behind. For the next round of the PSLM survey, for instance 2018-19 at the provincial level and 2019-20 at the district level, a module has been added in the questionnaire on disability status in Pakistan, in addition to calculating progress on SDG indicator 2.1.2, concerning the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES). 
A nationally coordinated MICS is being carried out in all of Pakistan’s federated units. Led by the PBS, this is the first nationally coordinated MICS in the country, which will provide robust household-level data on 33 key indicators, including several related to the well-being of children and women.  
National Nutrition Survey (NNS) have been completed, which provides important nutrition research underpinned by gender-differentiated nutritional approaches. Both this survey and the first-ever National Complementary Feeding Assessment (NCFA) have provided robust research in aid of evidence-based advocacy to end stunting. Moreover, the Government of Sindh has developed a Monitoring and Evaluation Framework for its Accelerated Action Plan (AAP) to reduce stunting and malnutrition, while developing an electronic dash board to monitor and report progress on all relevant indicators.   
Pakistan’s provinces are undertaking child labour surveys during 2018-19, to provide disaggregated data on child labour. The results will be crucial to take effective measures to eradicate prohibited forms of labour. The child labour survey was launched at the national level after the directive by the Prime Minister for a nationwide survey on the subject, reflecting the Government’s eagerness to learn from the survey findings and use these to formulate a comprehensive strategy to end child labour in Pakistan. 
6.3.3 Role of the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) 
Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) is the country’s focal institution for collecting data, coordinating with federal and provincial agencies on data collection, and reporting progress on the SDGs. The Bureau is responsible for the timely availability of disaggregated data. To this end, it has formed four Technical SubCommittees to review and finalize data collection instruments and the calculation of indicators based on an internationally acceptable methodology. They are expected to deliberate on data issues related to education; health, nutrition and gender equality; water and sanitation, and poverty, labour and employment. Through a broad consultative process, these Sub-Committees have approved certain amendments in data collection tools for both institutional and survey-based instruments. Which is expected to improve the validity and reliability of data. 
6.3.4 Setting Baseline and Targets 
The MoPD&R engaged with the provinces to establish baseline values for available SDG indicators, and set targets for each of these. These baselines and targets will feed into the SDG Monitoring and Evaluation Framework – a work in progress. Provincial governments are working with their district governments to map district-level baselines and targets for various indicators.  Punjab has finalized its provincial baselines and set targets for 2030, as well as establishing key performance indicators for attaining the goals and for monitoring the progress of public sector departments. Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir have also finalized their baselines and are working towards setting targets with the support of broad, inclusive consultations.  
A good example is the process adopted for the localization of SDG 6.1 and 6.2 targets. This process started in July 2016, when the Minister for Climate Change launched baselines for both targets, followed by provincial joint sector reviews. These facilitated the development of provincial WASH targets and master plans for SDG 6. Accordingly, national targets for this SDG were announced in December 2018 along with costed plan for achieving them. Designing and achieving SDG 6 targets for WASH were made part of the South Asian Conference on Sanitation (SACOSAN) declaration, hosted by Pakistan in April 2018. 
6.3.5 Developing the SDGs Dashboard 
‘SDG Pakistan Pulse’, a web-based data reporting portal, is being developed for online reporting needs against the targets set at the national and province levels. This centralized dashboard will offer tools for researchers, while improving transparency and informed policy- and decision-making. The dashboard will be supported by a robust M&E framework for SDGs.  
6.3.6 Evaluating Progress 
The Government of Pakistan recognizes that robust, high-quality evaluations are needed to effective measure progress on the SDGs. These must evaluate the efficiency, effectiveness, relevance, sustainability and impact of programmes and projects to assess whether public sector spending on development is on track for the SDGs. Therefore, federal and provincial governments, recognizing the need to build evaluation capacities, are planning to initiate training need assessment in this regard. Recent efforts have led to the development of provincial monitoring and evaluation policies, while strengthening public sector capacities for collecting and using evaluative evidence for the effective measurement of the SDGs. Instrumental impacts were recorded in Punjab and Balochistan, which drafted M&E policies as a strategic guideline on monitoring and evaluation work to facilitate the achievement of results and tracking progress on provincial SDG targets. Support on developing M&E policies also contributed to key government-led evaluations related to health (specifically, evaluations of the Mother and Child Week initiative and the Lady Health Workers Programme), water, sanitation and hygiene (the Clean Drinking Water for All initiative in Balochistan), nutrition (the Stunting Reduction Programme in Sindh) and education. The evaluation reports’ key findings and recommendations contributed to improving government programmes and policies in sectors. These evaluations will be fundamental for determining the effectiveness and impact of public sector programmes on SDG targets. 
Federal SDG Unit is leading the development of a comprehensive Monitoring and Evaluation framework for the SDGs to date to strengthen the collection and use of evidence and analytics for the SDGs. Work has commenced to provide a platform for effective, timely tracking and M&E, as well as developing a national M&E policy. 
6.4 CRITICAL CHALLENGES  
Several challenges can limit Pakistan’s progress on the SDGs. A lack of efficient coordination would deter implementation, lead to the duplication of efforts and make it difficult to build synergies. Coordination challenges also limit stakeholder participation in different types of consultations. A lack of awareness of, and knowledge on, policy coherence and the interlinkages among the SDGs is a major hurdle to developing an appropriate policy mix to achieve the SDGs. Limited awareness at the grassroots level is another important challenge to implementing programmes and projects related to the SDGs. 
To achieve the 2030 agenda through the implementation of Pakistan’s national development priorities, the Government is committed to ensuring that institutional arrangements and policies catalyse growth and sustainable development while addressing current challenges. As outlined in the snapshot presented in the table below, resource gaps will be addressed through innovative financing modes; by building synergies and clearly defining roles and responsibilities at the federal, provincial and local levels; building robust partnerships among all stakeholders; and seeking technology transfer from developed economies.   Pakistan’s large population often dispersed across sizeable geographic areas, and a lack of financial resources pose important challenges to achieving nutrition-related targets. 
 



7 WAY FORWARD 
Notwithstanding economic and financial challenges, Pakistan will continue to work towards achieving the SDGs through innovative, targeted and focused implementation strategies in the social, economic and environmental spheres. The Government will maintain the current momentum through consistency in plans, policies and the institutional strengthening process. The Benazir Income Support Programme, operating during the terms of three successive governments, will continue to serve the poorest households. 
 
Moving forward, the Government of Pakistan will stand firm in its commitment to the 2030 Agenda, and the momentum generated by putting institutional support mechanisms in place and aligning the SDGs with the country short- and long-term development priorities. In addition to a continued focus on alleviating poverty in all its forms and eliminating hunger, the Government will focus on fostering growth, achieving sustainable development and transforming Pakistan into an industrialized economy led by an innovative, healthy population, and making full use of modern knowledge and technology. 
Pakistan will enhance the implementation capacity of its institutions through the transfer of technical knowledge from global experts in the fields of environmental sustainability, responsible consumption and production, and innovation. For effective reporting on the 2030 Agenda, all tiers of government are also working to reduce data variability across the country. Pakistan will partner with international experts to benefit from successful models and, through adaptation, develop local solutions.  
As part of achieving this ambitious agenda, the national poverty alleviation program, Ehsaas (compassion) will be taken forward to expand social protection, safety nets and support human capital development. This will help to reduce inequality and lift those furthest behind first, in a coordinated and cost-effective manner. The centralized integrated disease surveillance system and newly launched universal health coverage programme, Sehat Sahulat, will be the cornerstones of the broad-based, inclusive health sector reform programme already underway in Pakistan. In 2019-20 alone, PKR 5.2 billion will be spent on these new initiatives in the health sector.  
Pakistan, beset by the adverse impacts of global climate change, faces a huge unbidden and unearned ecological debt. While it is only 31st in terms of global carbon emitters34, it is the seventh most affected by the fallout of climate change. Pakistan should be compensated for its low carbon footprint out to meet the estimated USD 10.7 billion per year needed for climate adaption, and the USD 8-17 billion required for mitigation.35 
Insufficient financing for sustainable development remains a challenge in difficult fiscal conditions and is likely to weigh heavily on the meaningful achievement of the 2030 Agenda’s ambitious targets. To this end, there is a need to channelize resources through stronger partnerships with the global community. In this sense, the achievement of SDG targets in developing countries hinges upon progress on target 17.3.40 A national approach anchored in partnerships, aided by technology and facilitated by finance, will catalyse and scale up implementation of the 2030 Agenda in Pakistan. 
PKR 13 billion have been earmarked during the coming year to create a knowledge economy with a vibrant, innovative research base in all sectors – including information technology, agriculture, science and technology, automation, banking, industry, telecommunications, robotics, cloud computing and big data. Recognizing the urgent need for climate action, Pakistan will scale up the Billion Tree Tsunami programme at the national level, with the more ambitious – yet achievable – target of planting 10 billion trees by 2023. PKR 8 billion has been earmarked for this initiative for 2019-20.      
 
  
 	 



8 CONCLUSION 
Reflecting political commitment and ownership of the 2030 Agenda, Pakistan integrated the SDGs into its national development agenda in February 2016. Pakistan was first such country to do so. This reorientation in its approach was guided, inter alia, by lessons learned from the MDGs. A National SDGs Framework was launched in 2018, envisaging a national vision, plan and strategy to optimize, prioritize and localize the full potential of the 2030 Agenda in Pakistan. Taskforces and Support units in the national and provincial parliaments will facilitate legislative support for the goals’ implementation and improve coordination. 
Commitment to poverty alleviation remains a key focus in Pakistan. Through key interventions and programmes, progress has been made despite persistent challenges. Over the last ten years, the poverty headcount has fallen in all dimensional significantly. The national poverty alleviation programme, Ehsaas (compassion) aims to expand social protection, safety nets and support human capital development throughout the country. This programme complements and expands the on-going social protection programmes. The size of assistance for the lowest strata has been enhanced.  
Only moderate reductions in stunting and malnutrition entails a greater focus on these issues, underpinned by the increased allocation of resources. Improved prevalence of skilled birth attendance, leading to the reduced neonatal mortality rate points to need for scaling up interventions. The Lady Health Workers Programme, with its grassroots presence, has been instrumental in achieving these improvements. Universal health coverage under the Sehat Sahulat Programme to provide health insurance coverage for those in need. Health sector reforms are underway, entailing a centralized integrated disease surveillance system and a strong inter-provincial information sharing mechanism.  
Although Pakistan’s carbon footprint is low, the adverse impacts of climate change on the country are enormous and imminent. Climate adaptation has become a forced reality for Pakistan. The country has commenced actions to protect the environment and contribute to efforts to minimize the effects of climate change. Both adaptation and mitigation are reflected in the country’s policy and implementation approach. Pakistan’s Billion Tree planting drive across 350,000 hectares was the first Bonn Challenge pledge to hit and surpass its commitment, using national resources. This project has now been up-scaled to 10 Billion Tree Tsunami – a five-year, country-wide tree planting drive to restore depleted forests and mitigate climate change. Moreover, programmes such as Clean and Green Pakistan and Recharge Pakistan have been launched. These ‘nature-based solutions for ecosystem restoration’ are leading examples of climate action among developing countries, with the added benefits of safeguarding biodiversity and generating livelihood opportunities. 
Periodic monitoring and evaluation of various strands of the SDG framework remains an important priority. Since 2018, baselines and targets for all SDG indicators have been determined in Pakistan. National data collection tools have been modified to improve data availability with a focus on the inclusivity, equity and sustainability aspects of the SDGs. Transparency will be a major hallmark of Pakistan’s monitoring and evaluation architecture through the development of a National Monitoring and Evaluation framework and the SDGs Dashboard.   
The 2030 Agenda has somewhat altered development discourse in Pakistan. Specifically, it has added a new dimension – the understanding that the Government alone cannot achieve development objectives, and that every stakeholder has to be encouraged to participate. To optimize the benefits of available resources, Pakistan has to, and is, exploring avenues for cross-sectoral cooperation and developing partnerships. This will be the hallmark of Pakistan’s implementation plan for achieving the SDGs. 
A country of 208 million people with rich cultural, ethnic and linguistic diversity, and facing complex development challenges, Pakistan has to learn and innovate, evolving and adapting successful models from across the globe. A key aspect of the country’s implementation strategy is strengthening existing alliances 

 
and forging new ones, while leveraging technology and mobilizing finance. Partnerships and close collaboration with a broad array of governmental, private sector, civil society, media stakeholders and international development partners, supplemented by regional and international support, will continue to be a major feature.  
New and well-thought-out ways for financing need to be explored – including diaspora funds, impact investments, venture funds for innovative solutions, financial tagging and Green ‘Sukuk’. In tandem, Pakistan is aligning its budgetary process, including its development funding, with the SDGs. Efficient, result-oriented investments can be maximized by picking out leverage points which connect with most SDG targets and have a higher multiplier impact.
