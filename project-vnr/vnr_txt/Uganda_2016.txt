EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
Uganda embraced the principles for sustainable development as stipulated in the 2030 Agenda. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is a plan of action for people, planet, prosperity, peace and partnerships to “Ensure that No One is Left Behind”. It builds on the unfinished business of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the commitment to eradicate poverty in all its forms. Building on this progress, the 2030 Agenda therefore, presents Uganda with an opportunity to refocus its development agenda, address the bottlenecks that hamper development, learn from, and network with other countries, and accelerate national efforts towards achieving a middle income status, while pursuing sustainable and inclusive development within the framework of the Uganda Vision 2040 and the second National Development Plan (NDP II). 
 
Accordingly, Uganda was among the first countries to localize the 2030Agenda for Sustainable Development into its national planning frameworks as well as creating national awareness about the Agenda. To this end, Uganda was among the 22 countries that volunteered to conduct a National review under the auspices of the first High Level Political Forum in July 2016. 
 
The Agenda renews Uganda’s commitment to sustainable development. Uganda actively pursued the sustainable development agenda since the early 90’s when it gained ascendancy as a development paradigm. This pursuit has unfolded in three distinct transition phases: post war reconstruction (1986 – 1997); poverty eradication (1997 – 2009); and social economic transformation (2010 -2020).  
 
Nearly three decades on from the first United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in 1992, Uganda remains steady in its commitment to sustainable development. Results from the 2014 National Population and Housing Census confirm that this commitment is yielding desirable results in social, economic and environment aspects. Between 1991 and 2014 life expectancy rose from 48.1 to 63.3 years; infant and under-five mortality rates dropped from 122 and 203 deaths per 1,000 live births to 53 and 80 respectively; orphan hood levels dropped from 11.6 to 8.0 per cent; literacy levels rose from 54.0 to 72.2 per cent; income poverty declined from 56 to 19 per cent; access to electricity – a factor that impacts heavily on the environment in Uganda – increased from 5.6 to 20.4 per cent; and the proportion of the national budget that is funded from domestic sources increased, from 64.7 per cent (FY 1991/92) to 82 per cent (FY 2014/15).  
 
Despite the above progress, Uganda still has significant room for improvement in pursuit of its sustainable development agenda. The economy is still heavily reliant on natural resources and agriculture; the current demographic structure propagates a high dependency ratio and low domestic savings; there is continued pressure on the forest cover because of limited access to modern forms of energy; inequality though falling remains high; vulnerability among different segments of the population is also still significant; and the economy remains in need of deeper and broader economic integration, especially at regional level.  
 
The adoption of 2030 Agenda has nationally been interpreted as embracing principles of sustainable development that promote prosperity for all people and protect the planet from degradation so that it supports the needs of the current and future generations. The 2030 Agenda presents an opportunity for Uganda to renew commitment to sustainable and inclusive growth, build stronger partnerships for implementation of the national development agenda, and accelerate efforts to address the bottlenecks to national development.  
 
Uganda’s leadership has accordingly sustained active commitment to development cooperation at regional and international levels. The most recent manifestation of this commitment was the leadership role in shaping the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the adoption of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda in July 2015. 
 
Uganda’s leadership at both political and technical levels embraced sustainable development right from the time of promulgation of the National Constitution which integrates key principles of balanced and sustainable development. The leadership of the country further demonstrated commitment to sustainable development through its strong support and approval of Uganda’s Vision 2040, the East African Community’s Vision 2050 and Africa’s Agenda 2063 – all of which strongly feature within Uganda’s second and current National Development Plan (2015/16 to 2019/20) whose overall goal is to transition Uganda into a middle-income country by 2020, through strengthening Uganda’s competitiveness for sustainable wealth creation, employment and inclusive growth. Localization of the Agenda for Uganda is accordingly being cascaded to sector and local government planning and implementation frameworks. The Manifesto of Uganda’s newly re-elected Government whose term of office runs from 2016 to 2021, is aligned to the second National Development Plan (NDPII 2015/16 – 2019/20) and has also embraced the principles of the 2030 Agenda on sustainable development. 
 
The second NDP’s preparation coincided with the deliberations and adoption of Agenda 2030 which provided an opportunity for the country to integrate the SDGs into its current NDP and resulted into the country being among the first in the world to integrate the SDGs into the national planning frameworks. In recognition of the importance of review and follow-up mechanisms, Uganda’s leadership is working to strengthen the implementation, coordination, and communication strategy for the current NDP and the Sustainable Development Goals. Key efforts in this regard include national and local level consultations on localization of the 2030 Agenda; National Information, Education and Communication campaigns; high-level policy dialogue engagements; institutional capacity development; and revitalised engagement with the private sector and civil society. 
 
The localization of the 2030 Agenda requires innovative approaches and adaptive programming of its interventions. On this note, the Government of Uganda has commenced implementation of a range of new social programmes based on enhanced targeting capabilities with the aim of ensuring that no one is left behind. Notable among them are: Operation Wealth Creation; Enhancing quality of Universal Primary and Secondary Education; the Youth Livelihood Program; the Higher Education Students Loan Scheme; the Social Assistance Grant for Empowerment for the elderly; the Legal Aid Programme, the Women Entrepreneurship Program; Community Tree Planting Programme; and the Skilling Uganda Program.  
 
Over the years, Uganda has made efforts to enhance its national capacity to formulate and implement development policies, plans and programmes. However, the ambitious and comprehensive nature of the 2030 Agenda requires further enhancement of national capacity on how best to steer inclusive development across time, sector, and regions of the country. To this end, Uganda has undertaken a number of reforms to improve institutional functionality and steer coordination and implementation of national development programs including; the establishment of the Delivery Unit in the Prime Minister’s Office, the Government Evaluation Facility, institutional coordination mechanisms, the issuance of certificates of compliance of the national and sector budgets to the NDPs, certificate of compliance to gender and equity, and is gradually shifting from output-based to programmebased budgeting. 
 
Furthermore, Uganda has introduced a number of reforms and pieces of legislations that will facilitate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. Key among them is the Public Finance Management Act (2015), the Public Private Partnership Act (2015), Public Procurement and Disposal Act (2014), the Financial Institutions Amendment Act (2015), and the Registration of Persons Act (2015). 
 
With the conducive policy, legal, and institutional framework in place, Uganda’s key challenge to attaining national development objectives now stems from inadequacies in implementation. Effective implementation of the Agenda 2030 therefore, requires rallying mass support, addressing implementation challenges, and devising new means to holistically plan, implement, and monitor development programs. Key among the proposed means of implementation are; strengthening institutions and reforms, increasing domestic revenues as a proportion of GDP, investments in public infrastructure, reforming public procurement, rallying the private sector, civil society, citizens and other partners towards implementation; tapping into technological capabilities for innovation and efficiency, public private partnerships, empowering local governments to deliver services and mobilising the population to effectively participate in the development programmes.  
 
To enhance data capturing and management, Uganda has developed a National Standard Indicator Framework to track progress towards attainment of middle-income status by 2020. 
This framework builds on the National Monitoring and Evaluation Policy, the Integrated NDPII Monitoring and Evaluation Strategy. Through these instruments the implementation of SDGs will be monitored, evaluated, and reported on. Already, Uganda has established that out of the 230 indicators in the global indicator framework for SDGs, only 80 indicators have data readily available in its current national statistical framework and the NDPII integrated some of the indicators, while others will be integrated into the subsequent third and fourth plans.  
 
Admittedly, there are challenges that remain which Uganda must address in order to facilitate implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the national development objectives including; weak multi-sectoral implementation planning, coordination gaps, data and reporting inadequacies, human and financial resource insufficiencies, multi-sectoral collaboration gaps, weak public private partnerships and mobilizing the population around the development agenda. 
 
The Agenda is relevant to Uganda’s socio-economic development, given the fact that it fits into its long term development planning framework–the Uganda Vision 2040. The 15 year Agenda provides Uganda adequate time to articulate the medium-term development goals and targets (10 years and 5 years) and ample time to implement and progressively measure ourselves. The next steps are: i) enhancing multi-sectoral implementation planning and coordination of SDGs ii) integration of SDGs in prospective development plans iii) strengthening data, monitoring and evaluation systems iv) establishing concrete PublicPrivate Partnerships (PPPs) for implementation and v) Harnessing the demographic dividend. 
 
The Government of Uganda re-affirms its commitment to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development and recognizes that successful implementation requires concerted efforts and partnerships to facilitate attainment of the desired development goals and targets. Uganda intends to partner with the international community in delivering this global development agenda. 
 
 


	SECTION I: 	BACKGROUND 
Uganda embraced the principles for sustainable development as stipulated in the 2030 Agenda. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is a plan of action for people, planet, prosperity, peace and partnerships to “Ensure that No One is Left Behind”. It builds on the unfinished business of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the commitment to eradicate poverty in all its forms. The latest MDG report1 for Uganda shows that Uganda achieved only 33% of the MDG targets and the 2030 Agenda provides an opportunity for Uganda to complete the unfinished business of the MDGs. Uganda’s unfinished MDG business is not understood simply as the targets that Uganda missed, but the underlying constraints that must be addressed to accelerate and sustain progress2. Building on this progress, the 2030 Agenda therefore, presents Uganda with an opportunity to refocus its development agenda, address the bottlenecks that hamper development, learn from, and network with other countries, and accelerate national efforts towards achieving a middle income status, while pursuing sustainable and inclusive development within the framework of the Uganda Vision 2040 and the second National Development Plan (NDP II).  
 
Uganda’s commitment to the 2030 Agenda builds on prior commitment to several processes that culminated into the adoption of the 2030 Agenda in September 2015 by the United Nations General Assembly under the leadership of Uganda’s Presidency. Since 1992 at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development at Rio de Janeiro (“Rio 1992”), 
Uganda took part in the processes that shaped the Agenda 2030, including: the World Summit for Social Development, 1995; Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, 1995; the Beijing Platform for Action, 1995; the Millennium Summit, 2000; the World Summit on Sustainable Development, 2002 (“Rio+10”); and the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, 2012 (“Rio+20”). Uganda’s commitment to sustainable development is further demonstrated through participation in regional and continental processes which have culminated into the East African Community Vision 2050 and the Africa Union Agenda 2063 respectively. 
With this commitment, Uganda has made significant progress in embedding sustainable development as laid out in Agenda 213 and other global commitments in its planning and development frameworks. In this regard, a number of policy, legal, and institutional frameworks are in place to facilitate sustainable development in its three dimensions of economic, social, and environmental. Key among these are; The Constitution of the Republic of Uganda (1995), the National Environment Management Policy (1994), the Energy Policy (2002), the Renewable Energy Policy (2007), the Rural Electrification Strategy and Plan (2022), the Uganda Vision 2040 (2012) and the National Development Plans (NDPs 2010-2020). 
 
Uganda’s thrust for sustainable development over the last 30 years has seen three phases of transition: post war reconstruction (1986 – 1997); poverty eradication (1997 – 2009); and social economic transformation (2010 -2020). During these phases, Uganda’s development approach has made attempts to ensure that no one is left behind by identifying the vulnerable population groups and designing programmes that address their specific needs. Overall, the key areas of focus have been: increasing household incomes; enhancing the availability of quality and gainful employment; increasing the stock and quality of infrastructure; human capital development; improving nutrition and food security; increasing access to quality social services (education, health, social protection, and water and sanitation); promoting good governance, defense, and security; and promoting sustainable population and use of the environment and natural resources (including combatting effects of climate change, water resource management, and wetland management). 
As a result, the country has made progress in a number of socio-economic indicators as highlighted below4:  
i) Sustained peace and security across the entire country. 
ii) An improvement in the quality of the population; with the proportion of people living in extreme poverty reducing from 56 in 1992 percent to 19.7 percent in 2013, life expectancy improving from 48.1 years in 1991 to 63.3 years in 2014, under five mortality rate reduced from 203/1000 live births in 1991to 90/1000 live births in 2011 and literacy rate increased from 54 percent in 1991 to 72.2 percent in 2014. iii) Sustained macro-economic stability and growth averaging about 5.5 percent over the NDP I period (2010/11 – 2014/15). Per capita income increased from USD 596 in 2008 to USD 788 in 2013/14. 
iv) Improvement in the stock and quality of economic infrastructure, including the improvement of proportion of paved national roads from four percent in 2008 to 18 percent in 2014, access to electricity from seven percent in 2002 to 20 percent in 2014, and ICT infrastructure. 
v) Progress in access to quality social services, with the average distance to health facility reducing from 5km in 2000 to 3.2 km in 2013; immunisation coverage increasing from 59 percent in 2000 to 93 percent in 2013; access to safe water increased from 57 percent in 2000 to 73 percent in 2013 and enrolment in Primary, Secondary and Tertiary increased from 7.3, 0.6 and 0.08 million in 2002 to 8.7, 1.3 and 0.2 in 2014 respectively. 
 
Despite the progress recorded, Uganda still has sustainable development concerns including; poverty, demographic structure with a high dependency ratio, inequality, service delivery bottlenecks, high rates of unemployment among the youth, reliance on natural resources and agriculture, reliance on water-fed agriculture, low agriculture productivity, low levels of access to clean and modern energy, natural resource degradation, and vulnerability among different segments of the population, such as women, children, persons with disabilities, indigenous communities, hard to reach populations and other vulnerable groups.5 
 
	1.1 	Objectives of the Review 
Uganda is among the first countries to adopt and mainstream the 2030 Agenda in its planning and development frameworks. As such, the country has volunteeredto participate in the first national review and report on progress undertaken towards implementation of the 2030 Agenda at the High Level Political Forum. The purpose of this review therefore is to demonstrate Uganda’s readiness towards the implementation of the Agenda and map out next steps required to achieve the Agenda. Specifically, the objectives of this review are to: 
i) Share experiences on adoption and integration of sustainable development in  national planning, monitoring, evaluation, and reporting frameworks and map out means for further integration; 
ii) Share on how Uganda is positioning itself to realign the institutional, legal and policy frameworks and systems to support implementation of the Agenda;  
iii) Share opportunities that the 2030 Agenda presents to Uganda’s development as well as challenges that could impede implementation of the Agenda, while identifying the next steps to tap into opportunities and address remaining challenges;  and 
iv) Galvanize national ownership and implementation for the localization of 2030 Agenda as a mechanism of national accountability.  
 
	1.2 	 Process for compiling the review report 
The approach for compiling this review report consisted of literature review and consultations; 
	i)	Review of literature and documents, including laws, policies, and reports 
      (documents referenced in the bibliography) ii) Consultations and input from key government institutions and representatives from the civil society which constituted the technical drafting team and the multi-sector technical committee on this review report from; Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development (MoFPED),Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA), Office of the Prime Minister (OPM), Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development (MEMD), National Planning Authority (NPA), Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS), National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) - Uganda and Uganda National NGO Forum. The drafting of this report was supported by an external consultant.  
iii) Consultations from technical government officials on the National Task Force on SDGs, chaired by the Permanent Secretary in the OPM. 
iv) Validation meeting with representatives from Ministries, Agencies and Departments (MDAs), CSOs, private sector, academia, special interest groups, development partners, Uganda Local Government Association. 
v) Validation by Cabinet.

Uganda’s experience in adopting and mainstreaming the 2030 Agenda is defined by the extent of involvement of country’s leadership at both political and technical levels and integration in the planning, monitoring and evaluation frameworks.  Equally important, are partnerships for localization of the Agenda at both national and international levels.  
	2.1 	LEADERSHIP AND OWNERSHIP 
Uganda has accordingly sustained active commitment to development cooperation at regional and international levels. The most recent manifestation of this commitment was the leadership role in shaping the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the adoption of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda in July 2015. The Government of Uganda’s Presidency of the Annual General Assembly influenced, motivated and shaped the Country’s actions to advance its readiness to implement the SDGs. 
 
Uganda’s leadership at both political and technical levels embraced sustainable development right from the Rio+ negotiations but was entrenched in the fundamental law before; the 1995 Constitution which integrates key principles of balanced and sustainable development. The leadership of the country has continued to demonstrate commitment to sustainable development through its Uganda Vision which was signed off by His Excellency the President of Uganda. The formulation of the Uganda Vision 2040 went through a wide consultative process involving Parliament, civil society, private sector, development partners, and citizenry. The development of the Uganda Vision coincided with consultations on the Rio+20 Summit, providing Uganda a chance to integrate the principles of sustainable development in its long term development framework, while also providing input into the global processes that ultimately fed into the 2030Agenda. 
 
Further, His Excellency the President has provided political leadership through signing off and rallying support for the country’s medium term plans (NDP I and NDP II) which have to a large extent integrated the principles and the specific sustainable development goals that apply to Uganda. The Manifesto of Uganda’s newly re-elected Government whose term of office runs from 2016 to 2021, is aligned to the second NDP and has also embraced the principles of the 2030 Agenda. 
 
In addition, the Cabinet and Parliament of Uganda have also provided leadership through policy direction and oversight to ensure implementation of the principles and interventions articulated in the country’s medium term development plans. Specifically, the Parliament which represents the voices of the people ensures that all policies, programs, and budgets are inclusive and equitable in line with the 2030 Agenda theme of leaving no one behind. 
 
In addition, there has been increasing commitment from the technical leadership, at the national, Sector, Ministry, Department, Agency, and Local Government levels to mainstream the 2030 Agenda and ensure its implementation. As a result of this technical leadership, Uganda was one of the first countries in the world to mainstream the relevant sustainable development goals and targets in the NDP II as the overall medium term development plan for the country. Furthermore, the 2030 Agenda has been integrated in some Sector Development Plans (SDPs) and Local Government Development Plans (LGDPs). 
 
In an effort to rally support and ensure national ownership for the 2030 Agenda,as already integrated in the national and decentralized development plans and programs, the Government of Uganda leadership has made efforts to involve other stakeholders and citizens. Some of the efforts include: 
i) The Government of Uganda in partnership with civil society convened several consultations in 2014 on localization of the 2030 Agenda at national and local levels. 
ii) Government of Uganda with support from UNDP conducted validation workshops in all districts and sectors in January 2015 to validate the NDPII and further popularise the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs. 
iii) Uganda was the first country to pilot the National Post 2015 briefing and capacity building in 2015 for government officials in partnership with United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA), United Nations Institute for Training and Research(UNITAR), and the United Nations Country Team (UNCT). 
iv) Following the July Addis Ababa conference on financing sustainable development, Uganda was the first country to hold a high level dialogue on financing sustainable development with the then President of the General Assembly, Uganda’s Minister for Foreign Affairsin 2015 in partnership with UNCT . 
v) To further create awareness and ownership of the 2030 Agenda at the local level, Government in partnership with the UNCT convened the planners’ forum and the local government forum for capacity building on their roles in implementation of sustainable development, in line with the NDP II. 
vi) The Government with support from the UNCT and the Belgian Technical Corporation organized the third United Nations Development Cooperation’s High Level Symposium in Kampala which brought together representatives from governments, civil society, the private sector and international organizations to share global and local experiences on how to revitalize partnerships to achieve the newly adopted 2030 Agenda in 2015. 
vii)In 2015, Cabinet was briefed on the Agenda 2030 highlighting Uganda’s commitment to following a sustainable development path, which views development in its three dimensions of economic, social and environmental, in a balanced and integrated manner. This brief implored Cabinet to affirm commitment and provide leadership in their respective ministries, to emulate the President’s commitment who represented the country at the time of adoption of the 2030 Agenda in September 2015. 
viii) The Government of Uganda in partnership with UNCT also organized a National Launch including an exhibition of the 17 SDGs. of the Global Goals. During the launch, five eminent Ugandans were engaged to serve as SDG Ambassadors to help raise awareness through participation in related SDG events as well as voicing radio messages. 
	2.2 	PLANNING FRAMEWORKS AND PROGRAMMING 
	2.2.1 	Integration of the 2030 Agenda in Uganda’s Planning Frameworks 
 
Uganda has a long term Comprehensive National Development Planning Framework (CNDPF) whose continued implementation inevitably provides a context within which to localize the fifteen-year 2030 Agenda. The CNDPF provides for the development of the 30 year Vision, three 10 year Perspective Plans, six five-year Development Plans, five Sector Development Plans and Local Government Development Plans and annual plans and budgets. To date, the country has already developed the Uganda Vision 2040 and the first and second National Development Plans. 
 
The Uganda Vision 2040 
The Uganda Vision 2040 provides the overall guiding framework on sustainable development and socioeconomic transformation for Uganda. The Uganda Vision 2040 document was prudently and comprehensively drafted to capture issues of sustainable development that are reiterated by the 2030 Agenda The Vision intends to transform Uganda from a peasant to modern and prosperous country by 2040. This involves changing from a predominantly low income to a competitive upper middle income county within 30 years, reaching a per capita income of USD 9,500.  
 
The Uganda Vision is conceptualized around strengthening fundamentals to harness opportunities. The opportunities highlighted therein are natural resources such as oil and gas, water resources, minerals, and tourism, agriculture whose gains can only be harnessed through strengthening infrastructure (energy, transport, water, ICT and oil and gas), human capital development, and a stable macroeconomic environment. The Uganda Vision has targets whose achievement will inevitably contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. It is therefore pertinent to synchronize national targets and indicators that will monitor SDGs with the national targets in the National Vision.  
 
 
National Development Plans  
The first National Development Plan (NDPI 2010/11 to 2014/15) whose goal and thrust was “Growth, Employment and Socio-economic Transformation for Prosperity’ was the first in a series of six development plans to operationalize the Uganda Vision 2040. It was instrumental in instilling the culture and discipline of planning as a basis for development planning and financing. Following the end of NDPI which coincided with the end of the MDGs, it was noted that Uganda had achieved two of the seventeen MDG targets – halving the number of people living in absolute poverty and achieving debt sustainability – and was on track to achieving another eight targets by end of 20156. Notwithstanding the slow progress on some targets such as reduction of maternal mortality, inadequate integration of sustainable development into national policies and programs, and environmental degradation, the recorded progress made towards the MDGs laid the foundation for accelerating socio-economic development in the NDP II era. 
 
The second National Development Plan (NDP II 2015/16-2019/20) which is Uganda’s current medium term plan is also the framework for implementing the 2030 Agenda and SDGs.  The NDPII intends to achieve middle income status by 2020 with a per capita income of US$ 1,039 through strengthening the country’s competitiveness for sustainable wealth creation, employment and inclusive growth. It should be noted that NDPII is only five year while the Agenda is 15 years, thus the subsequent NDPs (NDP III and NDPIV) will further integrate the SDGs. 
 
The preparation of the NDPII which was highly consultative also coincided with the deliberations and adoption of the 2030 Agenda.  This provided an opportunity for Uganda to integrate the SDGs into the plan (see summary of integration processes in Box 2 and Table 1 on the extent of integration).   
 
BOX 2: Summary of processes of integration 
i) The country’s planning horizon coincided with the end of the MDGs which created an opportunity to include the 2030 Agenda in the NDP II 
ii) Prioritization was important, focusing on fundamentals  (infrastructure and human capital development) that increase the country’s competiveness, and the opportunities (agriculture, tourism,  minerals , oil and gas) with the greatest multiplier effect 
iii) The process was highly consultative and iterative, covering a wide stakeholder base (sectors, academia, development partners, non-state actors, civil society, private sector, cultural and religious organizations, and citizens), who validated and strengthened the priorities and strategies  
iv) Government invited the UNCT to orient the drafting team about the then evolving post 
2015 Agenda 
v) The  Agenda was formally incorporated in the NDP II as part of the development context, and offered a framework through which different sectors could trace their linkages to the national priority areas 
vi) The framework was discussed with key stakeholders, and approved by Cabinet vii) Once the Agenda was integrated into the NDP II, work commenced to align sector and local government development plans and set corresponding targets  
viii) A number of non-state actors and development  partners  have also adopted components of the Agenda into their plans

The integration of 2030 Agenda will continue to trickle down to sector and local government planning frameworks since the NDPII provides the national strategic direction and guides planning at decentralized levels. In this regard, the Government of Uganda with support from the UNDP has trained sectors and local governments on SDGs and provided technical backstopping to local governments for quality assurance of development plans. The Government developed and disseminated development planning guidelines for sectors and local governments which provide for integration of SDGs into Sector and Local Government Development Plans (LGDPs).  
However, more work needs to be done: (i) develop detailed frameworks that sectors and local governments can use to integrate SDGs; (ii) build national capacity for planning and integration of SDGs; (iii) intensify sensitization for national ownership; and (iv) rally non-state actors particularly the private sector and civil society to integrate the SDGs into their investments, programs and plans.  
2.2.2 	Inclusive programming 
Uganda’s commitment to ‘ensure that no one is left behind’ has been a key feature in all the government programmes and the discussions shaping the 2030 Agenda. The idea that ‘no goal should be met unless it is met for everyone’ is well established in the campaign around the SDGs.  Leaving no one behind requires not only a targeted focus on the most vulnerable (the youth, the children, the women, the elderly, persons with disabilities, the poor, the ethnic minorities and the geographically disadvantaged), but more emphasis on participation and concerted efforts to build partnerships between government, civil society, private sectors to ensure that programmes are successfully implemented. Factors such as poverty, income and gender inequalities, landlessness and limited access to socioeconomic services that impede inclusive growth and development, and exacerbate the vulnerabilities of certain categories of people will therefore need to be addressed to ensure that no one is left behind. The subsequent sections illustrate how Uganda’s programmes have made steps to ensure that no one is left behind. 
Poverty and Inequality: There has been significant progress in addressing poverty and vulnerability in Uganda, with the national poverty rate declining from 56 percent in 1992 to 19.7 percent in 2012/13. However, as a result of the high population growth rate, the absolute number of people living below the poverty line has not reduced significantly. To date, over 6.7 million people remain poor and an additional 43 percent of the population is highly vulnerable to falling into poverty.  
Additionally, there remain significant poverty disparities across regions, social groups as well as between rural and urban areas. Disaggregation reveals disparity across regions with poverty reducing from 52.7 percent to 8.7 percent in the Western part of the country; from 73.5 percent to 43.7 percent in the Northern region; 58.8 percent to 24.1 percent in the Eastern region and 45.6 percent to 4.7 percent in the Central region7.  The Northern region remains the poorest part of the country albeit the gap has narrowed significantly since the restoration of peace in 2006.  
Government has, over the years, attempted to address the regional disparities in poverty and development through the introduction of the equalization grant, and through the introduction of special programmes. The equalization grant was introduced in FY1999/2000 as a block grant to a number of districts mostly in Northern and Eastern Uganda to give those districts wider fiscal space to address some of the most pressing service delivery gaps. This grant was given to districts for purely social service delivery. The special programs are managed and coordinated by the Office of the Prime Minister and include the Karamoja Integrated Development Program (KIDP); the Luwero and Rwenzori Development Program (LRDP); and the Peace, Recovery and Development Plan (PRDP) that includes the Northern Uganda Social Action Fund (NUSAF), Karamoja Livelihoods Programme (KALIP) and Northern Uganda Agricultural Livelihoods Recovery Programme (ALREP). 
Despite the reduction in poverty levels, Uganda’s level of inequality is increasing. Income inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient reduced from 0.426 in 2009/10 to 0.395 in 2012/13, and is higher in urban areas (0.41) compared to the rural areas (0.34). There are also variations in human development outcomes such as school enrolment, infant mortality and under-five mortality across different geographical regions.  In addition, risk and social vulnerabilities are on the increase and are generally associated with demographic characteristics such as age, sex, disabilities and covariate risks such as unemployment, access to social security, poor working conditions, poverty and disasters.  
Gender equality and empowerment of women: Uganda has made significant progress in strengthening gender equality and women’s empowerment. Notable among these is the formulation of gender responsive regulatory framework including policies and strategies. Further, progress has been registered in the institutionalization of gender planning in all sectors and increased collection of gender disaggregated data and information. Some outcomes from these interventions include a critical mass of women in Parliament (the proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments and local governments has given women a share of 35% in parliament and a minimum of 30% in local governments), gender parity in enrolment of girls at primary level, increased ownership of land by women, improved access to water and sanitation has reduced the time spent by women and children in fetching water. 
Women, however continue to face constraints related to access to, control over and ownership of businesses and productive resources such as land and credit.  Furthermore, there is limited employment of women in skill-based industries and this constrains women’s income potential. Women are also more likely to be excluded in skills development programs, access to financial resources, employment in non-agriculture sectors and inheritance rights. Only 27 percent of registered land is owned by women. Although 70 percent of the women are engaged in 
31 
 
agriculture, less than 20 percent control outputs from their efforts. Women comprise of the majority of labour force in the Agricultural Sector while men form the majority of the labour force in the Industry and Service Sectors. Female headed households comprise 80.5 percent of the agricultural subsistence workers compared to 67.5 percent of the male headed households. However, plots managed by women produce 17 percent less per acre on average than plots managed by men or jointly by other family members. In wage employment, fifty percent of the employed women work in the three of the lowest paying sectors compared to 33 percent of men.  
In order to achieve gender equality and women’s empowerment, the NDPII identified Women Economic Empowerment as a key strategy to uplift the economic participation of the women. In order to actualize this intervention, the Government of Uganda has approved and is implementing the Uganda Women Entrepreneurship Programme (UWEP) as an initiative that is aimed at improving access to financial services by women and equipping them with skills for enterprise growth, value addition and marketing of their products and services. Specific activities include; mobilization and sensitization of communities, training and capacity development, access to credit, access to appropriate technology and access to markets. Once this programme is well implemented, it will contribute to the creation of self-employment and wealth at the household level. The initial funding has been provided by the Government of Uganda through the Women Fund beginning with the Financial Year 2015/16. 
Child vulnerability: An estimated 8.1 million children in Uganda live under conditions of serious deprivation or danger8. Children who experience abuse, violence or are exploited, abandoned, or severely neglected (in or out of families) also face significant threats to their survival and wellbeing as well as profound life cycle risks that have an impact on human, social, and economic development. While there has been a significant reduction in the proportions of vulnerable children over the years, the number of Uganda’s children who are vulnerable to deprivation, abuse, violence and other challenging circumstances remains persistently high.  
32 
 
Overall, 38 percent of the children aged 0-17 years are vulnerable totalling 6.4 million children according to Uganda National Household Survey report 2009/2010. It is estimated that eight percent of children in Uganda are critically vulnerable, 43 percent are moderately vulnerable while 55 percent of children under five years of age are affected by child poverty. Karamoja and West Nile have the highest percentage of children experiencing multiple child poverty (68 percent). Currently, 2.43m children are orphans, over 1.7m children below 14 years are engaged in child labour (with 95.5 percent in agriculture), over 2.1m children live with older persons and 22,500 children fall victims of defilement offences annually. Some of the reasons that expose children to vulnerabilities include malnutrition, HIV and AIDS, orphan-hood, child abuse, neglect violence, limited family and community involvement.  
In a bid to protect the vulnerable children, Government in partnership with Development Partners and civil society organizations in January 2014, established the Uganda Child Helpline 
(UCHL)-116 – a toll free line as a mechanism to increase reporting of cases of child abuse. The Helpline was established as a medium through which children abused and seeking different forms of help could report and be helped. In addition, Government has developed an Alternative Care Framework to promote family based care for children and facilitate access to suitable alternative care options for children deprived of parental care in Uganda.  
Youth: The youth constitute 21.3 percent of the total population and 57 percent of the labour force. Seventy nine (79 percent) of youth live in rural areas where poverty levels are high and the major economic activity is agriculture. The youth in Uganda face numerous and multidimensional problems including: the persistence of inadequate employable skills; limited access to assets and other means of production; limited access to basic and critical health services, including sexual and reproductive health services, for example, only 30 percent females in Uganda have access to contraception services9, the majority being youth; early marriages and pregnancies with prevalence rates at 22.3 for the ages of 12 – 17 years in select districts10; and substance and drug abuse as a coping strategy for lack of employment. They are also affected by peer influence and other social pressures, exposing them to HIV/AIDS,  crime, unplanned pregnancies and STIs, lack of life skills needed to resist such pressures and to practice safe behaviour. Although teenage pregnancy has reduced from 43 percent in 1992 to 25 percent in 2013, it is still high compared to other countries.  
Government of Uganda has put in place a number of interventions to address the challenge of unemployment particularly amongst the youth who lack appropriate skills. One of the specific objectives in the NDP II that the Government of Uganda has rolled out the Youth Livelihood Programme (YLP), targeting the poor and unemployed youth in all districts in the country with an initial fund of 265 Billion Uganda Shillings (appx. USD 76 million)for five years starting with the Financial Year 2013/2014.  The funds are advanced to Youth Interest Groups in form of a revolving fund in order to increase outreach and enhance sustainability of the program.  Through this programme: the youth will be provided with marketable vocational skills and tool kits for self-employment and job creation; financial support to enable establish income generating activities; entrepreneurship and life skills; and knowledge and information for attitudinal change. 
Disability: The recently concluded Uganda National Population and Housing Census 2014 found that for the population aged two years and above, the prevalence of People with Disabilities (PWDs) was 12.4 percent while the equivalent for five years and above was close to 14 percent. Sex differentials revealed that disability was higher among women compared to men and higher among those living in rural areas compared to those in the urban areas. Strategies in the NDP II targeting PWDs are geared toward equalization of opportunities, rehabilitation and inclusion of PWDs in community activities.  
The Community Based Rehabilitation (CBR) for equalization of opportunities, rehabilitation, and inclusion of PWDs in their communities, is the current Government strategy towards interventions of PWDs. However, funding is accessed by only 26 districts in the country which is a big gap. The special grant for PWDs is a country wide affirmative programme for employment creation. The funding for the grant is still meagre to cater for the overwhelming demand by PWD groups. 
Social Protection interventions for the Poor and the Elderly: Social protection is globally recognised as critical for sustained poverty reduction, inclusive growth and social cohesion. Many Ugandans however have no access to social security, Direct Income Support (DIS) or social care services in times of hardship. This results in a high level of vulnerability to shocks and persistent poverty. Public investment in Social Protection stands at only 0.78 percent of GDP. Spending on DIS stands at only 0.33 percent of GDP which is significantly lower than the average 1.1 percent of GDP spent on DIS by other low income African countries. Approximately, only 3 percent of the Ugandan population has access to formal social security. Only 2.8 percent and 2.3 percent of the working population are covered by the Public Service Pension Scheme (PSPS) and National Social Security Fund (NSSF) respectively.   A number of small, private social security schemes managed by groups also do exist, but their impact remains minimal. 
The National Social Protection Policy (2016) was recently launched to provide a comprehensive and harmonised policy framework that addresses issues of reducing poverty and vulnerability through supporting excluded citizens to access services, providing a foundation on which to strengthen the capacity of the vulnerable persons and their families to meet basic needs build resilience, access opportunities and improve life chances. It aims at empowering all citizens to participate in and benefit from the social and economic transformation in the country.  The Policy has also been developed to promote effective coordination and implementation of relevant and already existing social protection interventions in the country. This policy is an integral part of the Uganda Vision 2040 which underscores the importance of social protection in addressing risks and vulnerabilities.  
The various social protection interventions that the Government of Uganda is currently implementing include: The Public Service Pension Scheme; The National Social Security Fund, Workers Compensation; Public Works Programmes; Social Care and Support Services and The Social Assistance Grants for Empowerment (SAGE).  
The SAGE has been one of the most recent flagship pilot programs to provide cash transfers to the elderly and the most vulnerable households. The program which started in 2011 to date has reached about 560,000 people in 124,547 households over a period of 4 years, receiving a monthly transfer of 25,000 Ugandan Shillings. The program started with 14 pilot districts and is now being rolled out to reach 20 Districts. Key impacts of this program include; reduction in household poverty, increase in consumption expenditure at household level, increase in food expenditure, increase household welfare and wellbeing and increase on cultivated land. 
The Government is already in the process of reforming the Public Service Pension Scheme to improve sustainability and is also reforming the contributory social security system. The Uganda Retirements Benefits Regulatory Authority has been established to oversee the reform of retirement benefits and regulate the industry. 
Climate Change adaptation and mitigation: The high reliance on climate change sensitive sectors coupled with limited ability to cope makes Uganda one of the most vulnerable countries to the effects of climate change.  Notably, the severity of the effects of climate change are unevenly distributed across different age groups, genders, economic and social classes making the elderly, people with disabilities, women, youth and children the most vulnerable. Albeit fair progress has been registered in containing the effects of climate change at the policy, planning, legal and institutional levels, more needs to be done in terms of climate change finance readiness and enhancing the financial and technical capacity of implementing institutions at sector and local government level. The national strategy on climate change is building national resilience and pursuit of development along a low carbon development path. Although aligned, the climate change interventions are generic thereby losing sight of specific interventions tailored to the needs of the aforementioned most vulnerable groups.  
The National Climate Change Policy assigns two key responsibilities of coordination to institutions at the national level, and implementation to sectors and local governments. Whilst remarkable progress has been made at all levels, financial and technical capacity gaps at the national level are augmented at the local government levels. The costed implementation strategy of the National Climate Change Policy indicates that Uganda will require an estimated total of US$ 3.9 billion (approximately US$ 258 million per annum) over the next fifteen years to address climate change concerns in addition to the existing interventions. Readiness to respond to climate change through increased expenditure is still lacking especially among the implementing institutions such as sectors and local governments whose expenditure is highly conditional and earmarked for specific programs and projects. 
Green growth development: Uganda is also developing a green growth development strategy to operationalize green growth initiatives espoused in the Uganda Vision 2040 and the second National Development Plan (2015/16-2019/20). The strategy describes how Uganda will pursue sustainable production and consumption patterns, create green jobs, mitigate and adapt to climate change and decouple economic growth from environmental degradation. This however requires leap frogging in terms of technology to embrace clean technologies that are more efficient, effective and emit less greenhouse gases. Capacity building in terms of skilling the youth in utilisation of green technologies is pertinent in this endeavour. Equally important is appropriate technology transfer to ensure leap frogging and pursuit of development along a low carbon path.  
Sustainable Energy for All: Uganda is among the countries which are implementing the Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All), a global initiative to ensure universal access to modern energy services, doubling the rate of improvement of energy efficiency, and doubling the share of renewable energy in the global energy. Uganda’s energy sector is faced with challenges must be addressed in order to achieve the goal of sustainable energy for  all, including; need to increase modern forms of energy, increasing generation capacity to meet the growing demand, strengthening the transmission and distribution infrastructure to reduce system losses and improve reliability, low energy consumption, and increasing efficient utilization of energy. 
Uganda has set national objectives to be achieved by 2030 in order to increase access, efficiency, and sustainability of energy. Specifically, Uganda aims to: increase electricity access to cover 98 percent of the population from 15 percent; increase access to modern cooking solution to over 99 percent of the population; improve energy efficiency of power users by a minimum of 20 percentand to reduce wood fuel consumption by 40 percent; and increase the renewable share in the total final energy consumption for electric power to over 90 percent and increase renewable energy for thermal purposes to 36 percent.  
Implementation of SE4All initiative in Uganda will follow three phases involving transition, consolidation, and acceleration of strategies and actions to achieve energy efficiency, access, and renewable energy goals by 2030. Among the strategies put in place by Government are: increasing generation capacity and renewable energy for access from four percent in 2007 to 61 percent by 2017; achieve universal rural electrification by 2040; financing renewable energy project; and doubling the rate of improvement in energy efficiency. 
Despite the efforts highlighted above, implementation of the 2030 Agenda requires comprehensive programs that promote inclusiveness, resource efficiency, poverty eradication, job creation, and climate change adaptation to ensure that no one is left behind. While the Government of Uganda has pursued inclusive development, there is need to pursue programs that are holistic in nature to fit the interlinked nature of SDGs. Therefore, the country’s planning approach should be enhanced to ensure that the programming systems are comprehensive enough to holistically analyse and devise appropriate interventions and modalities for addressing the various vulnerabilities and development needs. This requires efforts by all development actors – both state and non-state – including civil society, private sector, development partners, and the citizenry.  
	2.3 	EFFORTS BY NON-STATE ACTORS TO IMPLEMENT THE SDGS 
Localization of the SDGs will not only be at the national level but also in planning, implementation, monitoring and reporting to ensure effective implementation of the Agenda. Non-state actors play a major role in promoting innovative financing, advocacy, monitoring and creating awareness among citizens about their role in implementing 2030 Agenda.  
2.3.1 Civil Society Organisations 
The CSOs in Uganda have been able to engage in the 2030 Agenda though a coordinated process. The National CSO Core Reference Group (NCCRG) on SDGs is a consortium of CSOs doing work around SDGs. The NCCRG is hosted by the Uganda National NGO Forum and through its leadership, the CSOs engaged in a number of processes and consultations that have contributed to creating awareness on the SDGs. Key among these include: the Uganda CSO Consultation on Post 2015 Development Agenda10 in July 2014; regional workshops on localizing the SDGs in Districts of Mbarara, Mbale and Lira Districts; the National Launch of Action 2015 Campaign under the theme “Leave No One Behind.”;  the Pan African CSO Conference on Financing for Development in July 201511; the Global Citizens’ Day of Action (September 2015); and 4th Certified Public Accountants – Uganda (CPAU) Economic Forum whose theme was Sustainable Development; These have contributed to mobilizing and sensitizing citizens on the 2030 Agenda, creating a common understanding and building synergies amongst CSOs. They have further advocated for efficient utilisation of resources and localization of the 2030 Agenda in the planning processes. The CSOs under their coalitionNCCRG have also embarked on monitoring of the SDGs as they are being implemented within the existing institutional structures. Various organizations are working with Government to build capacity particularly to monitor the SDGs at the local level. 
 
2.3.2 Private Sector 
The private sector is involved in financing and ensuring sustainable and inclusive growth that generates decent employment and reduces poverty and inequality. They partner with government through Public Private Partnerships (PPPs), and through other development interventions for effective implementation of SDGs. The NDPII identifies PPPs among the mechanisms for financing the plan. This form of partnership has already been demonstrated to work even for very large projects most recently applied to the construction of the Tororo Phosphate plant, the Bujagali hydroelectric project, the Kilembe mineral project, the KenyaUganda railway project and Kalangala infrastructure services project, among others. Government has already embarked on promoting and encouraging PPPs in various forms for the smooth implementation of NDPII. PPPs will be encouraged and promoted in the provision of infrastructure and energy, as well as undertakings which require substantial financial resource outlays in line with the Public Private Partnerships Act 2015. 
In addition, a number of private sector institutions through their corporate social responsibility activities have been involved in SDG initiatives and the provision of improved services for example, setting up school projects, health centres, opening rural access roads and setting up sanitation facilities. While government has played a major role in creating an enabling environment for the private sector to operate and do business, more must be done to deliberately rally the private sector to invest in SDG priority areas and supplement public financing through PPPs. 
2.3.3 Development Partners 
Successful implementation of the NDP II will require building new partnerships and strengthening the already existing partnerships for technical and financial assistance, capacity building, and trade. The Government of Uganda has benefitted from different partnerships in the design and implementation of development policies and programs from a number of development partners. These partners have played a key role in facilitating the integration of the SDGs into the Planning, Legal, and Policy frameworks, popularizing, creating ownership and financing of the 2030 Agenda.  
Through partnerships, the civil society, private sector, youth, academia and development partners provided technical input into the NDP II process and successfully advocated for key cross-cutting issues pertinent to the 2030 Agenda to be mainstreamed in the NDP II (such as youth, gender, human rights and climate change). Additionally, development partners conspicuously UNDP have supported the Government of Uganda in the  development of the NDPII including integration of SDGs as well as alignment of the local government development plans to the NDP II. 
In a more recent initiative from development partners, a formal partnership has been established between the government and the Pulse Lab Kampala, an initiative of the United Nations to monitor progress of the NDP II and SDGs through real time data tools. The Pulse Lab Kampala has already collected information about issues and priorities for the 2030Agenda from analysis of social media and SMS text messages. 
	2.4 	MONITORING, EVALUATION, AND REPORTING 
	2.4.1 	Mechanisms for monitoring progress and reporting 
Uganda recognizes the power of evidence-based decision making across all the levels of the public and private sector. To this effect, the NDP II is fully cognizant of Uganda’s development obligations as enshrined in the Constitution, the East African Community Integration Protocols, the Africa Agenda 2063, Vision 2040 and the Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development. In this context, the Sustainable Development Agenda has been integrated into the NDPII and therefore, monitoring and reporting mechanisms of SDGs implementation will follow the existing arrangements under the NDP II.  
 
In FY2014/15 Uganda adopted an integrated NDPII M&E Strategy to coordinate and support sectors, MDAs, LGs and other stakeholders (CSOs and Private Actors) in undertaking monitoring and evaluation for the period 2015-2020. The NDPII M&E Strategy encapsulate a results framework for the NDPII providing an integrated multi-layer monitoring and reporting framework at all levels of service delivery. 
 
As part of reporting, the country produces annual and periodic reports. The annual reports include: Annual National Development Report (NDR), the Government Annual Report (GAPR), SDG Progress Report, Annual Sector Performance Reports and MDA statistical abstracts. Others are independent assessments of government programs; World and African Statistical Year Books; World Economic Outlook by IMF; Human Development Reports by UNDP; African Union and East African Community (EAC) Reports; District Development Plans and Reports; and other relevant information. The periodic reports are: NDP Mid-term Review Reports, End of Plan evaluation Reports, selected Policy/Programmes Evaluation Reports 
	2.4.2 	Data sources and availability 
Currently Uganda is implementing its second National Strategy for Statistical Development (NSDS2) that is aligned to NDP II and provides an integrated programme for censuses and surveys. In addition, the NSDS2 articulates mechanisms for strengthening administrative data and civil registration systems. It is envisaged that the information need for monitoring Agenda 2030 will be delivered through implementation of NSDS2 as well as non-conventional data sources that include Big-data and geospatial technologies and information from private actors. 
 
Similarly, Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) in collaboration with the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development (MoFPED), Office of the Prime Minister (OPM), and National Planning Authority (NPA) are in the process of developing a National Standard Indicator (NSI) framework.  This NSI framework is a three level hierarchical indicator framework; the national, sector and service level indicators for monitoring government operations.  These indicators are aligned to the National Development Plan II goals and objectives and address the broad requirements of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  However, SDG Agenda 2030 Indicators are yet to be integrated into the monitoring, evaluation and reporting systems at sector and local government levels. This will include “localization” of the global indicators as applicable and relevant, based on national priorities. 
 
The fiscal year 2014/15 is considered the most appropriate baseline year for measuring progress of implementation of Agenda 2030 in Uganda because it is the baseline for NDP II. In addition, a wealth of data/information was made available during the course of the fiscal year 2014/15. Such information is available from the 2014 National Population and Housing Census, 2014 Rebased GDP series and routine administrative data from Central Government Ministries, Departments and Agencies. For indicators where no data series are available for 2014/15, data from the most recent surveys will provide the baselines as well as data from upcoming surveys.  
 
With regard to data availability for SDG Indicators, a quick assessment revealed that data is available for only 80 indicators (35%) of the 230 indicators and no data on 113 others that are relevant to Uganda. Thirty seven (37) other indicators are either for global monitoring or not applicable to Uganda’s situation (see Annex 1). This low level of data availability is partly associated with absence of internationally accepted methodology for computations of some indicators, limited national capacities in the management of administrative data and weak civil registration systems. Worse still, some indicators are not applicable to Uganda’s situation. In some cases where data is available, it can be disaggregated by incomes, sex, age, geographical location and residence. Assessment for baseline indicates that, only 33 indicators where data is available (on 80 indicators) have baseline information. Where Indicators have baseline information, they are characterized by limited data disaggregation and time lags depending on the frequencies of data collection according to the national statistical system (refer to Annex 1). 
 
The major data sources include: Administrative Data from MDAs, Civil Registration and Vital Statistics, National Population and Housing Census (NPHC), Census of Business Establishment (COBE), Uganda Census of Agriculture (UCA), Livestock Census, Uganda National Household Surveys (UNHS), the Uganda National Panel Survey (UNPS), the Demographic and Health Surveys (UDHS), National Service Delivery Survey (NSDS), Malaria Indicator Survey, Sero and Behavioral Survey and National Biomass Study. 
	2.4.3 	Challenges in monitoring and reporting 
Over the years, focus on monitoring and reporting gained significant importance in the public sector due to the growing demand for accountability and managing for development results. However, the country continues to grapple with limited capacity to undertake effective monitoring and evaluations. The key challenge in monitoring and reporting is availability of quality statistics both for the baseline and subsequent monitoring of trends. The capacity of the National Statistical System to deliver on responsive data needs is mainly constrained by: 
i) Differences/absence in statistics standards, concepts and definitions ii) Limited appreciation of statistics and its role in economic and social development, iii) Inadequate appropriation of resources for statistical activities,  iv) Lack of baseline data on a majority of indicators and limited disaggregation on available data 
v) Absence of appropriate methodologies and technologies for measuring some indicators, vi) Weak coordination among data producers as well as statistical programmes and activities. 
vii)Underdeveloped administrative data and civil registration systems viii)	Irregularity of data collection programmes. 
 
SECTION III: 	UGANDA’S POSITIONING TO STRENGTHEN ITS INSTITUTIONAL, LEGAL, AND POLICYFRAMEWORKS AND SYSTEMS TO SUPPORT IMEPLEMENTATION OF THE 2030 AGENDA 
Over the years Uganda has made efforts to enhance its national capacity to develop policies, plan, implement, and monitor and evaluate its development programs. However, with the adoption of the 2030 Agenda and its integration in national development frameworks, Uganda will need to further enhance existing capacity and reposition itself to implement and achieve results of the ambitious, and yet relevant agenda.  
3.1 LEGAL AND POLICY FRAMEWORKS 
Uganda’s legal framework is shaped by the 1995 Uganda Constitution which among other provisions spells out rights for all citizens to peace and democracy, a clean environment, food security and nutrition, clean and safe water, national unity and stability and recognition of the role of women in economic development and the need for balanced and equitable development. All these issues have been reiterated by the 2030 Agenda and Uganda will continue to adhere to its Constitution thereby directly contributing to the realization of the 2030 Agenda. Other legal frameworks that contribute to the 2030 Agenda include; the Public Finance and Management Act (2015), Higher Education Students Financing Act (2015), the Petroleum (Exploration, Development and Production) Act (2013), Financial Institutions Amendment Act (2015), the National Planning Authority Act (2010), the Public Health Act (2010), the Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation Act (2010), the Domestic Violence Act (2010), the National Environment Management Act (1995), Registrations of Persons Act (2015), the Children’s Act 
(CAP 59), the Prevention Of Trafficking In Persons Act (2009), the Electricity Act (1999), andthe Persons With Disabilities Act (2006). Enhanced implementation of the aforementioned inclusive laws will enormously contribute to the achievement of 2030 Agenda.  
 

There are also existing policy frameworks that will contribute to 2030 Agenda  including; the National Social Protection Policy 
(2015), the HIV/AIDs policy 
(2011), 	the 	National 
Climate 	Change 	Policy 
(2014), 	the 	Equal 
Opportunities 	Policy 
(2007), 	the 	National 
Environment Management Policy, the Child Labor 
Policy (2007), the National 
Policy for Older Persons (2009), the National Policy on Disability (2006), the Uganda Gender Policy 
(2007), the Universal Post 
Box 3: Sustainable Development Principles in the Uganda Constitution  
i)	The right to development (SDG 1) ii)	Food security and nutrition (SDG 2) iii) Medical services and recreation sports (SDG 3) 
iv) Education and cultural objectives and protection of the family 
(SDG 4) 
v) Recognition of the role of women in society (SDG 5) vi) Clean and safe water (SDG 6) vii) Preservation of public property and heritage (SDG 7) viii) Recognition of dignity of persons with disabilities ((SDG 1, 7) ix) Protection of the aged (SDG 1, 3, 4, 7) 
x) Balanced and equitable development (SDG 8, 10, 11) xi) General social and economic objectives (SDG 2, 3, 6, 7, 9) xii) Protection of natural resources, the environment, and natural disasters (SDG 12, 13, 14, 15) 
xiii) Democratic principles, national unity and stability, national sovereignty, fundamental human rights, gender balance and fair representation of marginalized groups (SDG 16) 
xiv) Provision of adequate resources for organs of government, role of people in development, role of state in development, duties of a citizen, and foreign policy objectives (SDG 17) 
 

Primary Education Training Policy (2007), the National Agriculture Policy (2013), the National Monitoring and Evaluation Policy of the Public Sector (2013), the National Orphans and Other Vulnerable Children’s Policy (2004),  the National Coordination Policy (2015), the Energy Policy (2002), the Renewable Energy Policy (2007), and the National Nutrition Policy is in its final stages of formulation.  
3.2 	INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK 
Uganda’s institutional framework provides support in implementation of the policy, legal and planning frameworks. Already, the country has a number of requisite institutions which are in position to facilitate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. 
These include: 
 
i) The Office of the President which takes overall leadership and oversight of implementation and is charged with the responsibility to mobilize the citizens to embrace the national development agenda. 
ii) The Cabinet which is charged with providing policy direction for the development agenda. 
iii) The Parliament which oversees implementation of the development agenda, appropriates resources for financing development, ensures the national budget is aligned to the NDP and enacts enabling legislation to support development.  
iv) The Office of the Prime Minister which is responsible for coordinating implementation of all development programs and monitoring, and reporting progress of implementation of all government policies and programs.  
v) The National Planning Authority which is the central agency charged with the production of comprehensive and integrated development plans for the country elaborated in terms of perspective vision and the long and medium term plans. In its role, NPA ensures that such global commitments on sustainable development are localized and mainstreamed into the national development plans. NPA also ensures that sectors’ and local governments’ development plans align to the national development priorities through alignment processes and the issuance of certificates of compliance. 
vi) The Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development which is responsible for resource mobilization and allocation, ensuring accountability for resources disbursed, and ensuring there is a direct linkage between planning, budgeting, and resource allocation during budgeting and implementation. 
vii) The Uganda Bureau of Statistics which is responsible for provision of data, coordinating and harmonizing data, and ensuring that all the relevant indicators are captured into the national statistical system. 
viii) The rest of the MDAs develop and implement sector plans in line with NDPII priorities, account for allocated resources, and provide technical support and supervision to local governments.  
ix) Local governments which are service delivery points implement national projects and programs, and mobilize local revenues to finance local government priorities, as well as mobilising the population to participate in development programmes.  
x) Private sector and other non-state actors which play a key role in partnering with government to deliver development programs. 
3.2.1 	Coordination mechanisms to Steer Implementation of SDGs 
Government has in place the National Coordination Policy which will guide the coordination framework on SDGs in addition to other government programmes. The Policy outlines the guiding framework for management of Government’s coordination machinery to enhance public service delivery and effective implementation of national planning frameworks and programmes. In line with the Policy, the following coordination mechanismswill require strengtheningin order to effectively steer implementation.  
 
i) Sector Wide Approach to Planning  
Government of Uganda established the Sector Wide Approach in the late 1990s with a purpose to harmonize and coordinate planning, financing and implementation at the central government and local government’s levels. However, the approach over the years has seized to be operational in majority of the sectors. Within the SDG framework, government will reinstitutionalize and ensure operationalization of the sector wide approach to facilitate intersectoral collaboration, harness synergies and avoid duplications while increasing efficiency and effectiveness in service delivery.  
 
ii) Implementation Planning  
Given the inter-likeness and multi-sectoral nature of the SDGs, there will be need for strengthening implementation planning to coordinate relevant stakeholders around a particular SDG to effectively plan and ensure coordinated implementation that will lead to the realization of the targeted results. This will reduce duplication of resources and lead to efficient and effective implementation of the SDGs.  Where necessary, multi-sectoral action plans or strategies will be developed to rally key implementing stakeholders and map out key milestones for the SDGs. NPA will act as a clearing house through which SDGs interventions, cross cutting in nature will be coordinated to ensure that stakeholder’s plans are synchronized 
 
iii) The Proposed SDG Coordination Framework 
Additionally, Uganda is positioning itself to improve efficiency in coordination of implementation of the 2030 Agenda through modification of existing institutional and coordination frameworks to include 2030 Agenda in line with the National Coordination Policy. In this regard, the SDG coordination framework is a proposed initiative, yet to be adopted thatwill be operationalized through different levels of political and technical committeesas elaborated below: 
i) The SDGs Policy Coordination Committee (PCC) comprising of members of Cabinet, Heads of UN Agencies, and Heads of Missions, chaired by the Prime Minister. This committee provides policy guidance and direction to MDAs on SDGs, and reviews implementation. 
ii) The SDGs Implementation Steering Committee (ISC) comprises of Permanent Secretaries, Heads of Agencies, and Development Partners, chaired by Head of Public Service and Secretary to Cabinet. This committee will review progress and make recommendations to the PCC. 
iii) The SDGs National Task Force (NTF) comprises of technical officers from OPM, MoFPED, MoFA, MoLG, NPA, UN, NGO Forum, and PSFU, chaired by the Permanent Secretary in the OPM. The committee will meet quarterly to review reports from technical working groups for consideration by ISC. 
iv) There are five SDGs Technical Working Groups (TWGs) to engage various ministries as follows: Coordination, Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting TWG led by OPM; Data TWG led by UBOS; Planning TWG led by NPA; Communication and Advocacy TWG led by OPM; and Finance TWG led by MoFPED. 
 
3.2.2 	Reforms to Improve Institutional Functionality 
The Government of Uganda is further implementing reforms to improve institutional functionality and facilitate efficient service delivery. Key among these reforms are; 
i) The establishment of a delivery unit in the Office of the Prime Minister to fast track implementation of core projects, presidential initiatives, and key sector results. This will also facilitate the implementation of SDGs while ensuring that the critical priority areas are being efficiently allocated resources and implemented. 
ii) All accounting officers at national and local governments to sign performance contracts in line with NDP II results and targets. This will facilitate resource allocation and accountability for delivery of expected results. 
iii) The issuance of a Certificate of Compliance of the national budget to the NDPII and MDA plans and budgets to NDP II before approval by Parliament. This will ensure coherence between the budgeting and planning instruments and allocation of recourses to priority areas. 
iv) The progressive shift from output-based budgeting to programme-based budgeting to increase efficiency and reduce duplication of programmes while enhancing multi-sectoral collaboration and harnessing linkages. 
 
While Uganda has sufficient legal, policy, and institutional frameworks in place to support the 2030 Agenda, the challenge lies in ensuring effective implementation of the legal and policy frameworks. The success in implementation largely depends on the functionality and capabilities of all implementing and coordinating institutions at the national and local government levels. The reforms to improve institutional functionality and the mechanisms proposed to steer implementation presented above are potential game changers that can accelerate Uganda’s improvement in implementation.  
3.3 MEANS OF IMPLEMENTATION 
The means of implementation structure follows the current structures of Government. SDGs were incorporated into the NDP II with the aim to ensure that the Government policy framework, budget priorities and programmes are properly aligned with the SDGs in the overall framework of the NDPII. This alignment ensures adequate attention to the underlying challenges to economic growth and development. The role of CSO’s, private sector and other stakeholders in rallying efforts behind the SDG’s has not been ignored as they have been actively involved in the consultative processes. 
The implementation of the NDP II implies the implementation of the 2030Agenda. This section highlights the existing and planned efforts to ensure a holistic approach to implementation of the 2030 Agenda. 
3.3.1 Increasing Domestic Tax Revenues 
The means of implementing 2030 Agenda are enshrined in the NDP II Fiscal Strategy that emphasizes domestic revenue financing for sustainable growth.  Government has set a target of increasing the tax to GDP ratio by 0.5 percent per annum to reach 16 percent by 2018, although Uganda still faces a low tax to GDP ratio of 13 percent of GDP, which is much lower than its counterparts in Sub Saharan Africa. In the medium term, there are efforts to enhance domestic revenue mobilisation by expanding the tax base; reforming the structure of taxation; reducing the size of the informal sector; and improving efficiency in tax collection and compliance. 
3.3.2 Investment in Public Infrastructure 
Through fiscal expansion, Government is frontloading infrastructure investment in key sectors such as Transport, Energy, ICT and Oil and Gas to harness concessional and semi- concessional financing and other development support facilities that are targeted to accelerate investment in infrastructure and human development among others. This is expected to ensure; sustained macroeconomic stability and economic growth, robust private sector growth and development, and increase fiscal space to support investment in social sectors in order to improve the quality of human skills in order to further reduce poverty. The resulting outcomes will ultimately lead to increased progress on SDG implementation. 
 
3.3.3 Financing Modalities and Debt Management 
In a bid to utilize new and innovative sources of finance, Government is using a broader range of financing modalities to meet the country’s infrastructure investment requirements. A public debt strategy for the medium term was approved. This strategy provides for a wide scope of debt management and financing alternatives including concessional, non-concessional, external and domestic financing, in contrast to previous strategies which focused on grants and concessional financing. The strategy covers a broader range of non- concessional instruments; liabilities under Public Private Partnerships and other direct and contingent liabilities; and sets new benchmarks and limits. 
3.3.4 National, Regional and International Partnerships 
Uganda has taken steps to strengthen mechanisms for management of partnerships with development partners through the Uganda Partnership Policy (2013). This policy specifically aims to: improve the effectives of development cooperation through greater government ownership and leadership; strengthen economic management by increasing flows of development through the budget and coordinating off-budget flows; increasing transparency and accountability between Government and development partners, and Government and citizens; and accelerate progress towards policy coherence in Uganda’s relationships with development partners. The Uganda Partnership Policy is complemented by the National NGO Policy (2015) which sets out a framework to strengthen the relationship between the NGO sector and Government, and enhance capacities and effectiveness in the areas of service delivery, advocacy, and community empowerment.  
There are a number of initiatives that development partners are involved in, and will continue to support government programmes, build capacity and create awareness on the 2030 Agenda, as per the partnership commitments at the international level under SDG 17. Such commitments include: mobilization of finances; implementation of the official development assistance (ODA) commitments; implementing investment promotion regimes for developing countries; promoting technological transfer and regional and international cooperation; supporting capacity building; promoting non-discriminatory and equitable multi-lateral trading systems; and ensuring policy coherence, multilateral stakeholder partnerships, and support data, monitoring, and accountability systems.   
Beyond its physical borders, the country’s regional and international cooperation efforts span across a range of areas with the main ones currently being trade and investment, infrastructure, and tourism. Other areas of cooperation include peace and security, and trans-boundary natural resources management. These regional partnerships will be important in providing a means of absorbing shocks and financing critical infrastructure. More so, the regional partnerships provide a platform for knowledge sharing, innovations, and capacity development, which can be viewed as important non-financial means of implementation and within the context of the 2030 Agenda and agenda 2063. 
Uganda is actively engaged in efforts to deepen regional integration and remains committed to its membership to the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), East African Community (EAC), Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and the African Union (AU). 
Within the EAC, the country will benefit from the implementation of projects geared to attainment of SDGs that fit within the EAC Regional Integration.. Key of these include the Northern Corridor Integration Projects whose aim is to facilitate the competitiveness of the region in the global market by fast tracking projects for the benefit of citizens and the development of the region. It includes clusters that handle ICT, Oil Refinery, Financing, Power Generation, Transmission and Interconnectivity, Commodities Exchange, Human Resource and Capacity Building, Land, Immigration, Trade, Tourism, Labour and Services, Single Customs Territory, Mutual Defence Cooperation, Mutual Peace and Security Cooperation and Airspace Management. Projects coordinated by Uganda include the Standard Gauge Railway, ICT Infrastructure and the Crude Oil Refinery.. The on-going implementation of the projects is already contributing to reducing the cost of doing business, enhancing economic growth, improving people’s livelihoods, and creation of employment opportunities. Uganda’s prospects for industrialization will be boosted when the key flagship projects particularly the standard gauge railway, the crude and refined oil pipelines, power generation, transmission and interconnectivity, and single customs territory are fully implemented.   
Uganda is also part of the Tripartite Free Trade Area comprised of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, - East African Community and Southern African Development Cooperation which opens up a wider market of over 600 million people and a combined GDP of about 1 trillion dollars, with the free movement of goods across borders of the three regional blocks. This partnership will open up more markets for Ugandan goods and services to be exported duty free in all the 26 member countries significantly increasing the export earnings and improving the balance of payment position of the country. 
3.3.5 Science, technology and innovation (STI) 
The 2030 Agenda calls on all countries to enhance research, upgrade technological capabilities, encourage innovation, grow the number of research and development (R&D) workers per one million people and increase public and private R&D investment. Uganda has made progress in the area of STI as seen from the development of a number of research and development products in crop breeding, disease control, ICT, formulation of Science &Technology (S&T) policies such as the National Information and Communication Technology (NICT) Policy (2003), the National Biotechnology and Bio-safety Policy (2008), the Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) Policy (2009), and the recent creation of the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation that will act as a  definite home for  agencies, organs and initiatives dealing with research, innovation and scientific discovery and inquiry. 
NDPII identifies slow technology adoption and diffusion in the country as a challenge in the country which will have to be tackled to facilitate implementation of SDGs. To facilitate implementation of the 2030 Agenda,  Uganda intends to scale up science and technology activities the following areas; creation of a science and technology fund and increasing financing to promote research and development, establishment of science parks and science centres, establishment of science and technology information management systems, and strengthening the intellectual property management system, widening dissemination of information to facilitate knowledge transfer and information sharing for example utilisation of the U-Report platform, strengthening partnerships for technology development, transfer and adoption especially to facilitate industrialisation, and improvement in human resource capacity, among others. 
3.3.6 Empowering Local Governments to deliver services 
The Outcome document of the Kampala Declaration on Developmental Local Government which arose out of the seventh Commonwealth Local Government Conference held in Munyonyo, Kampala in May 2013 stressed the relevance of Developmental Local Government to the successful implementation of the 2030 Agenda and in particular to gear efforts towards putting local governments at the heart of development. Local governments will play a major role in implementing, and monitoring SDGs and therefore have the responsibility for setting local/sub-national targets and indicators and overseeing their realization. 
Being at the front line of service delivery, successful implementation of 2030 Agenda requires maximum involvement of local governments for sustainability. Uganda`s decentralisation devolved powers to the local governments to enhance local economic development and expand local revenue bases. However Local governments still face a number of challenges in delivering services mainly related to; financing and revenue mobilization, human resource capacity gaps, inadequate community mobilization and others. As a means of implementation, empowering the Local governments will involve; increasing their functionality in terms of building technical capacity and increasing financing, promoting Local Economic Development and community mobilisation, and improving planned urban development, among others, in a bid to effectively deliver services.  
3.3.7 	Mobilising the population to participate 
To rally the population towards implementation of SDGs, the Government of Uganda will ensure effective mobilization and sensitization of the various categories of the population to enhance their participation in programmes and projects geared towards the realization of SDGs in line with the NDP II and local community development needs. 
SECTION IV: OPPORTUNITIES ANDCHALLENGES 4.1 	OPPORTUNITIES 
The 2030 Agenda presents opportunities for Uganda that require innovativeness and renewed commitment, renewed inter-sectoral collaboration and coordination due to interlinkedness of the SDGs to harness synergies; revitalization of partnerships between Government, CSOs, private sector, citizenry, and development partners; renewed commitment to eradicate of poverty, and achieve sustainable, and inclusive growth; learning and sharing global experiences and best practices; acceleration of national efforts to address gaps in development – from planning to implementation; and networking with other countries at the regional and global levels. 
Specifically the Agenda provided the opportunity for:  
i. Completing the unfinished business of the MDGs – going beyond achieving the unmet targets to addressing the underlying constraints. 
ii. Refocus Uganda’s development Agenda though the current and the next generation NDPs (up to 2030) to achieve more inclusive economic growth and thus further reduce inequalities/ exclusions in national development, given the theme of leave no one behind. 
iii. Develop new continental/ global partnerships and cooperation’s on SDGs for experience sharing, learning as well as for increasing resource mobilization by adopting mire innovative solutions.  
iv. Opportunity for greater leverage of the presently underutilized potential of the private sector to advance SDGs in Uganda.  
v. Reform national systems for more integrated planning and implementation at national and sub- national levels.  
vi. Strengthen local governments and civil society engagements to increase chances of achieving SDGs for all Ugandans.  
4.2  	CHALLENGES 
Even with the current policy, legal, institutional and planning frameworks, there are admittedly a number of gaps that need to be addressed in order to facilitate efficient and effective implementation. Key among these are the following: i) Multi-sectoral Implementation Planning  
The inter-linkedness and multi-sectoral nature of the SDGs presents a planning challenge. Additionally, the general practice in Uganda is that sectors operate vertically according to their mandate and there is often minimal effort to harness inter-linkages horizontally across sectors, which would significantly improve efficiency in implementation. Therefore, there is need for strengthening implementation planning to coordinate relevant stakeholders around a particular SDG to effectively plan and ensure coordinated implementation that will lead to the realization of the targeted results. The National Planning Authority therefore needs to strengthen its capacity to facilitate integrated development planning across the SDGs using multi-goal modeling and project planning tools. There is also need to strengthen inter-sector collaboration mechanisms to harness synergies from inter-linkages among the SDGs through re-institutionalizing and operationalizing the Sector Wide Approach.  
 
ii) Coordination of Implementation 
While Government has an institutionalized coordination mechanism, there are evident gaps in coordinating implementation across MDAs, civil society, private sector, and development partners to ensure that all the stakeholders are focused on implementing interventions that are geared towards realization of the national development priorities. As a result, resource allocation in the past has not been fully aligned to the national development priorities. Therefore, there is need to strengthen and harmonize the various coordination mechanisms available to avoid duplication of duties. 
 
iii)Data, Monitoring, Evaluation, and Reporting  
Although effort has been made to enhance the capacity of the National Statistical System (NSS) to respond to increasing statistical needs through the development and implementation of the second National Strategy for Statistical Development, the administrative data and civil registration systems are still weak. Mapping the SDG targets and indicators to the country indicators in the NDPII, the NSS and the necessary data requirements on these indicators reveals a major gap requiring the country to undertake baseline surveys as well as analysis of available administrative data to facilitate reporting on SDGs. More to that, the methodologies and technologies to support compilation of data for some key SDGs indicators are not yet defined in the country context. The NSS relies mainly on Surveys and Censuses to furnish its statistics needs, however these are not often conducted regularly due to resource constraints so as to provide up-to-date information. This has led to time lags in a number of baselines as well as nonavailability of some. In addition, there is limited disaggregation on most of the data required for tracking progress of the implementation of SDGs.  On monitoring, evaluation, and reporting, there are still multiple systems across government entities requiring the development of a coordinated monitoring, evaluation and reporting system. In addition, the country continues to grapple with limited capacity to undertaken effective monitoring, evaluations and reporting.  
 
iv)Financial and Human resource capacity  
While Uganda has made significant progress in funding the national budget from domestic resources up to 80 percent, the ambitious targets of the SDGs presents a financial constraint which requires the country to mobilise additional domestic resources and other means of financing beyond the traditional sources. Therefore, the country will need to mobilize more resources to: ensure comprehensive programming, alignment and compliance of sector and local government plans and budgets to the NDP II and SDGs; enhance programme implementation; ensure that data, monitoring and evaluation and reporting systems are established and functional; and ensure and periodic reviews of the NDP II. There are also significant human resource capacity gaps in government in numbers (average of 60 percent staffing levels), soft and hard skills at different levels, constraining innovation and effective implementation. It is thus necessary to build capacity of the current staff and to support recruitment of new staff to fill up these gaps in order to realize the SDG targets.  
 
v) Implementation and enforcement of laws and policies 
Despite having strong legal and policy frameworks to ensure that no one is left behind, the country faces a challenge of effective implementation and enforcement of the laws thus undermining efficiency in service delivery. It is therefore necessary to strengthen enforcement and put in place mechanisms to fast track implementation of the laws. 
 
 
vi)Mobilizing and rallying the population around the development agenda  
While Government of Uganda has made efforts to popularize and rally support for the national development agenda, there is still lack of public understanding and knowledge of the 2030 Agenda and SDGs. Citizens and stakeholders are not sufficiently empowered to access information, meaningful participation, and understanding of their roles in the process of development. It is therefore imperative to reinforce public sensitization programs to build confidence to participate and own the 2030 Agenda. The local governments being the service delivery points will need to be empowered to mobilise community participation and ensure delivery of SDGs at the lowest level.   
 

 
 
SECTION V: GALVANISING NATIONAL OWNERSHIP FOR LOCALISATION OF THE 2030 AGENDA 
 	 
The Report provides an opportunity for Uganda to galvanise national ownership of the SDGs to ensure that the commitment demonstrated by state and non-state actors during the adoption and integration is maintained during the implementation, monitoring and review of the SDGs. The process of this review has enhanced national understanding, collaborations, awareness and commitment by the different stakeholders towards identifying the roles they will play in implementing the Agenda. The report clearly identifies the milestones in moving the Agenda forward across areas of policy, planning, coordination, implementation, financing, monitoring and evaluation, and partnerships thus enabling the various stakeholders to have entry points in ensuring that the gaps and challenges are addressed to facilitate the realisation of the desired targets.  
 
Critical to galvanising ownership is the need for the population to understand the importance of the Agenda, the role of the national and local governments, their own roles and responsibilities and how to hold the duty bearers accountable on the implementation of the Agenda.  
 
In view of the above, the government of Uganda with support from the UN under the technical working group on Communication and Advocacy is in the process of developing a Communication Strategy for the SDGs. The strategy will aim to reach the largest portion of Ugandans using messages and concepts of sustainable development that are easily understandable and explain the relevance of the Goals to everyone.  The youth, media and members of the community will play a major role in supporting government deliver these messages through harnessing the power of local culture.  
The dissemination of this review report at national, regional and international levels will further galvanise stakeholder’s efforts and commitment towards prioritising interventions geared towards achievement of the goals and targets. In addition, the report presents the opportunity for government to provide accountability to its citizens on the efforts so far undertaken to ensure that no one is left behind in the national development process.  
SECTION VI: LESSONS LEARNT, NEXT STEPS AND CONCLUSION 
 
6.1 LESSONS LEARNT 
 Some of the lessons learnt during the implementation of the PEAPs, MDGs, NDPI and throughout the process of localizing the 2030 Agenda are: 
i) Good governance and leadership at all levels is important to galvanize support for the 2030 Agenda and implementation of SDGs. For example, Uganda’s unsatisfactory performance on MDGs is attributed to the inadequacy and lack of conscious effort to fully integrate them as part and parcel of the national development agenda. To this end, the 2030 Agenda has been fully owned by leadership at the national level, and the NDP II has already integrated the 2030 Agenda.  
 
ii) The policy and legal frameworks are a means rather than an end in the successful implementation of the 2030 Agenda. These frameworks must be buffered by strong institutional capacities, sufficient human resource and financing. Many projects have failed or had slow implementation due to institutional weaknesses and insufficient funding. Therefore the proposed institutional reforms in the NDPII are aimed at improving institutional capacity and public sector management to enhance synergies across sectors and improve service delivery.  
iii) Owing to the multi-dimensional nature of Sustainable Development Goals, the recognition of the vital role played by non-state actors and their active involvement in complimenting government efforts in the implementation of sustainable is paramount. This therefore calls for building strong coalitions and partnerships with private sector, civil society, academia, and the citizenry.  
iv) Some challenges to SDGs implementation are multi-sectoral, and therefore the insistence on sector silo approaches to development is no longer tenable. There is need for deeper inter-sector collaboration and a coherent approach to financing development. To this end, Government is progressively shifting from out-put based budgeting to programmebased budgeting so as to break down silo operations, avoid duplication of efforts, and promote a more comprehensive approach to planning and budgeting for sustainable development.  
 
v) One of the lessons learnt from the MDGs era is that there was no clarity on how goals were set and inconsistencies between goals, targets, and indicators were not adequately addressed, which makes their application difficult. Having been part of the adoption of the Agenda, the Government of Uganda has embraced the SDG global indicator framework and has assessed the indicators that are relevant to its development context. The Government is also making efforts to map out the SDG indicators to the NDPII results framework and to the NSS.   
vi) One of the lessons learnt from implementing the NDPI was that it was wide in scope and stretched the country’s development resources so thin, yet the MDGs had a narrow focus which did not include the country’s key strategic sectors. To this end, NDPII has prioritized key growth drivers including Agriculture, Tourism, Minerals, oil and Gas, Infrastructure and human capital development to drive national development. The 2030 Agenda is broadly encompassed within the national development agenda however the government will continue to prioritize SDGs in the subsequent five year development plans.  
vii) Although decentralization devolved power from the center to local governments, the local governments have not effectively delivered on their functions. Many service delivery functions fall in their mandate, and yet they are hampered by inadequate financial and human resource capacities. Through the process of localizing the 2030 Agenda, the importance of participating in global process to draw lessons and best practices on localization cannot be overemphasized. Local governments as delivery and implementation units for the SDGs need to be empowered to champion priority setting and given flexibility in mobilizing resources for financing local level development priorities which complement the 2030Agenda. This way, development can be locally owned. 
viii)The need to leave no one behind in the development process through the integration of cross cutting issues including human rights, gender and equity, child protection, climate change, disability, nutrition, environment, population and HIV/AIDS.  
6.2 	NEXT STEPS 
The 2030 Agenda for sustainable development is relevant to Uganda’s socio-economic development, given the fact that it fits into the CNDF – a 30 year timeframe in which to realize development goals as set out in the Uganda Vision 2040. The 15 year 2030 Agenda provides Uganda adequate time to articulate the medium-term development goals and targets (10 years and 5 years) and ample time to implement and progressively measure ourselves. The next steps are: 
 
i) Enhancing multi-sectoral implementation planning and coordination of SDGs.  Moving the SDG Agenda forward, the government of Uganda intends to develop a clear road map for localisation of the Agenda at both national and local government levels. Multisectoral action planning around specific SDG goals and targets using multi-goal modeling and project planning tools.Additionally, to harness synergies and inter-linkages among the sectors the Sector Wide Approach will berevitalised, institutionalized and operationalized. Fast track the adoption and ensure implementation of the proposed SDG coordination framework including establishment of an SDG reporting system at national, regional and international levels.  
 
ii) Integration of SDGs in prospective development plans 
It is through the national development plans that the SDGs will be implemented, owned and achieved. Therefore the country will establish and build national concession what is achievable in the third and fourth National Development Plans covering the next 10 years of the SDGs; iii) Strengthening data, monitoring and evaluation systems 
Having identified the data gaps in line with the SDG indicator framework, the next step is to generate comprehensive metadata on all indicators (concepts, definitions, & methods), undertake baseline surveys, produce quality, comparable and regular statistics to address national data gaps and meet policy and reporting commitments, disseminate and make statistics accessible to all users to inform research, advocacy, policies and programmes, and promote accountability.  On monitoring, evaluation, and reporting, focus will be on developing a more comprehensive and coordinated monitoring, evaluation and reporting system that further integrate indicators and targets in all other planning and implementation documents including; the Sector Development Plans, Local Government Development Plans and budgets; 
 
iv) Establishing concrete Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) for implementation.  
To mobilise resources and fast track implementation, government will establish concrete PPP arrangements and sign agreements with private sector players and development partners around their areas of interest in line with the NDPII priority areas and SDGs, 
 
v) Harnessing the demographic dividend 
Government will continue to integrate the population growth and structure issuesin the planning, implementation and financing frameworks in order to fast track the realization of the demographic dividend. 
6.3 	CONCLUSION 
Uganda is still in the category of low developed countries, with most of the social and economic indicators still lagging behind many countries and thus all the SDGs are in line with Uganda’s current and future development needs and aspirations in pursuit of a middle income status by 2020.  
 
This report therefore demonstrates Uganda’s readiness to implement Agenda 2030. However, as has been highlighted in the report, even with the necessary planning, policy and legal frameworks and institutions in place to enhance implementation, there are challenges and capacity gaps that remain which must be addressed in order to effectively implement the 2030 Agenda.  
 
The government of Uganda re-affirms its commitment to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development which has been integrated in the national development and planning frameworks and monitoring systems as well as policy documents. The government recognizes the remaining challenges that require concerted efforts and partnerships to facilitate attainment of the desired development goals and targets. Uganda intends to partner with the international community in delivering this global development agenda.
