EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1. Coordinated by the Ministry of Finance, the process of preparing the Voluntary National Report (NVR) is responsible for monitoring the integration of the International Development Agendas into national planning, including following the implementation of the United Nations 2030 Agenda Sustainable Development in Cabo Verde. The National Directorate for Planning under the Ministry of Finance, which is the focal point of the SDGs and mandated to coordinate the implementation of the SDGs, is being supported by an interagency Working Group composed of representatives from key Ministries, public agencies, regulating agencies, UN agencies, the private sector and civil society. The Report was prepared based on a consultative process, the result of which was subsequently compiled by the Ministry of Finance and subject to a socialization and validation workshop by the stakeholders.
2. Following a successful journey in achieving the Millennium Development Goals, in which the country will have made important progress in all intervention areas and have achieved most of the MDGs in the against the post 2015 challenges and based on the lessons learned from the MDG review, the Cabo Verde 2030 Agenda was widely discussed in Cabo Verde prior to approval. In 2013, Cabo Verde conducted a series of consultations on the MDGs and on the post 2015 agenda, in order to assess the current state of development, while 
8
preparing for the post 2015 horizon. Similarly, seeking a national consensus on the Cabo Verdean perspective in 2030, the government promoted a National Forum in May 2014 that identified the urgent need to prioritize the Sustainable Development Goals. In June 2015, the High Level Conference on SDGs in Small Island Developing States with Middle Income status was held in Praia, Cabo Verde, which adopted a final document, "The Praia Declaration", in which the major concerns of African SIDS were higlighted.
3. The SDGs has also made visible the program of the Government of the IXth Legislature and consequently the Sustainable Development Strategic Plan 2017-2021 (PEDS), which is fully aligned with the SDGs. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is acknowledged as the agenda of Cabo Verde, as the platform to understand the present and the path to the future for these Atlantic islands.
4. Located on the West African coast, 500 km from Senegal, Cabo Verde is an archipelago made up of 10 islands, including nine inhabited islands, one uninhabited island, and eight islets.  The land portion has an area of 4033 km 2, but Cabo Verde is mainly made up of sea, that is, a vast Exclusive Economic Zone of around 734 thousand km2, equivalent to about 183 times the land surface. About 10% of its territory is classified as arable land in, these islands that are all of volcanic origin, which still possess an active volcano, the volcano of Fogo, and which had its last eruption in 2014-2015, with harmful consequences for its populations. 
5. As a Small Island Middle Income Country, Cabo Verde's biggest challenge is to build an economy with a high level of sustainable and inclusive growth, in order to overcome key constraints, structural vulnerabilities, external dependence, unemployment, poverty, inequality in income distribution, reduced opportunities for emigration and consequent drop in remittances. Cabo Verde is confronted with natural vulnerabilities related to its volcanic origin, its island-made nature, its location in the Sahel region, scarcity of rainfall and lack of mineral resources. Moreover, its small territorial, demographic and economic size and its isolation from the African continent are characteristics that limit the real development possibilities.
6. Cabo Verde has made remarkable progress in its almost 43 years of independence, rated since 2007 as a Middle-Income Country, however it continues being a country of deep inequalities and of regional asymmetries that have persisted over the last 78 years. As a result, Cabo Verde keeps leaving a lot of people behind, and remains at risk. There are 179,909 people living in absolute poverty, of whom 54,395 are in extreme poverty, especially women (54%) who are the majority of the poor. These are the families who do not have piped water or electricity or have interrupted supply because the price is excessive. And also the disabled who do not attend formal education or vocational or higher education because there is not adequate and mass assistance for children, young people and adults with Special Educational Needs (SEN). It is the unemployed and especially unemployed young people who are not in any education or training establishment. The LGBT community is still the victim of ignorance, incomprehension or intolerance. It is the Cabo Verdeans and especially the majority of young people who do not have effective political participation. This is also the case of the disabled, the elderly and people with dependents, without income.
7. The implementation of the 2030 Agenda should be an opportunity not to continue to leave them behind but also not to allow new groups to be left behind. Action must be early, starting with those farthest behind. It also provides an opportunity for inclusive economic growth, for the integration of all in the labor market, through quality inter-island maritime transport, security and comfort, but mainly regularity, as well as for the regionalization of the PEDS, by local dialogue platforms through decentralization and creation of administrative regions. Similarly, it is an opportunity for the blue economy that values what we have most abundant, that is, the surrounding sea, and its resources, as well as for the official statistics guaranteeing the mapping of the poor and vulnerable people, an opportunity for the focus and monitoring of the pro-poor public policies, the Single Social Registry (permanent instrument for mapping vulnerable families, monitoring the situation of the families and the single reference for social transfers). For the income transfer programs aimed at the elderly and vulnerable, by the National Care System, through the social tariff of water and electricity, by extending the coverage of compulsory social security\0x220F by the action of organized civil society\0x220F in short, by the social and solidarity economy, due to the dynamic insertion of Cabo Verde into the World Economic System, as a Small Island Developing State, through the process of selling and buying goods and services in the external market. 
8. Cabo Verde is a country that is excessively vulnerable to international circumstances, extremely vulnerable from a food perspective to agroclimate variations, but also to fluctuations in the external market. The food insecurity in Cabo Verde has a structural and multi-factorial nature and concerns the structural deficit of the national food production and the strong dependence on the international market, and the economic accessibility weaknesses. Strengthening the Food Security and Nutrition Information System (FSNIS) is a first-rate challenge. The National Strategy for Food Security for the 2020 horizon places greater emphasis on nutritional issues and the Human Right to Adequate Food (HRA) and its implementation in the context of good articulation and coordination between the various actors involved in food and nutrition security, will contribute to the achievement of SDGs 2. The Law on the Human Right to Adequate Food (HRA), the National School Feeding Program, the National Program for Agricultural Investment, Food and Nutrition Security for the period 2018-2022, the Single 
9
Social Registry, National Resilience Priorities (NRP / AGIR) of Cabo Verde and the project POSER-CLIMA are essential instruments of action to carry out this journey.  
9. In the field of health, Cabo Verde has followed a path of success, achieving great progress in health indicators, especially in recent years, reaching the MDGs related to infant mortality and maternal mortality by 2015. The Government's agenda for the 19th Legislature has elected health as one of the priority areas and has set out a set of commitments based on the principle that Governments should ensure a strong social policy, particularly in the health system, in order to address the universality, justice, accessibility, solidarity, equity, efficacy and effectiveness that affect, precisely, people. The main axes of NHS reform are related to the Regionalization in Health, Development and Qualification of Human Resources in Health, Reinforcement of Primary Health Care, Hospital Reform, promotion of the economic and financial sustainability of the NHS and the implementation of an effective Health Information System.
10. In Cabo Verde, the right to education is enshrined in the Constitution of the Republic, which establishes "freedom to learn, educate and teach" and "everyone's right to education." Such as the promotion of the values of democracy, the spirit of tolerance, solidarity, accountability and participation. Cabo Verde met the MDG 2 \0xECAchieve Universal Primary Education.  Since 2000, basic universal schooling has been considered an achievement: 93 out of every 100 children between the ages of 6 and 11 attend primary school and 89 out of every 100 children, of school age, complete the last year of this level of education (6th year). The Government of Cabo Verde understands that the period of early childhood is essential for the integral development of the child throughout the life of the child, and therefore foresees, within the framework of the Strategic Plan of Education, to promote the access of all children to 4 to 5 years of pre-school education by extending and improving quality in line with the UN recommendations. The extension of compulsory basic education up to 8th year is one of the government's priorities. which is duly welcomed in the PEDS and the Strategic Plan of Education. The reorganization of the school network of compulsory basic education, curricular review and the revision of the legislative package were also made since 2017. The higher education supply exclusively in Santiago and S\0x201Eo Vicente, which may generate structural opportunity asymmetries since at least 3/4 of the students of this level are from these islands. Education should continue to carry out its main mission of inclusion and upward social mobility and thereby combat the inter-generational transmission of poverty, and this requires effective policies of positive discrimination in favor of islands without higher education institutions and positive discrimination of young people from poor families, through social transfers. 
11. Cabo Verde has made significant progress on gender equality and equity, particularly in the context of the MDGs. 
10
Cabo Verde has agreed to reach 50/50 as part of the SDGs 2030 Agenda and the Government considers gender equality as a central issue for inclusive and equitable development, being one of the 11 priorities for the decade and transversal to the entire Government and the PEDS program, representing an example of success in inserting 2030 Agenda in the national strategic plans. Regarding the fight against gender-based violence, mention should be made of the 2015 publication of Decree-Law no. 8/2014, which consolidates the regulatory conditions needed to fully implement the Special Law on GBV adopted by the country in January 2011.  The Second National Plan for Gender Equality 20152018 in execution covers the three main gender dimensions, i) economic empowerment in line with goals 4 and 7 of SDGs 5; ii) the physical autonomy of women and girls, including combating GBV, health, sexual and reproductive rights, in line with targets 2,3 and 6; and (iii) leadership and political participation of women in line with goal 5. The Plan also devotes a specific focus to strengthening and institutionalizing the mainstreaming of the gender approach. The National Plan for Care, approved in 2017, represents an integrated model of care co-responsibility between families, the state, the community and the private sector as a framework for transformational changes in women's lives, social and family welfare, gender equality and the promotion of human rights. With regard to increasing women's political participation and decision-making, the country has an ongoing important project to adopt a parity law\0x220F by engaging the PEDS, the CEDAW, the Beijing Platform for Action, the Development 2063 of the African Union and 2030 Agenda of the Sustainable Development Goals, especially goal 4 of SDG5, and this law should be submitted to the Cabo Verdean parliament by the end of 2018. Cabo Verde initiated the implementation of gender-sensitive budgets in 2017, and is thus close to achieving indicator 5.1. 1 of the SDG 5, by institutionalizing gender markers in the Government Budget. 
12. In the water sector, Cabo Verde has largely exceeded the MDG target, despite the fact that the arid climate with reduced rainfall and rugged relief determine the availability and cost of water production. The vast majority (64.1 per cent) of the Cabo Verdean population is supplied through the public water supply system and only 9 per 100 people do not have access to drinking water, with notable differences between urban and rural areas, but also between men and women in relation to access to the public water network. Also in the field of sanitation, the country has made a notable progress, considering only 1 in 5 people did not have sanitary facilities, with notable differences between urban and rural environments. Years after the adoption of the Integrated Water Resources Management Action Plan (PAGIRE), the State of Cabo Verde in 2012 started the reform of the water and sanitation sector, aiming at guaranteeing everyone the right to water and sanitation, safeguarding the sustainable use of resources with a thorough review of the legal and institutional framework, also aiming at ensuring the access to a minimum of forty liters of water per person per day and a disincentive to con-

11

sumption of more than ninety liters per person per day, as well as the reduction of distances to levels not exceeding ten minutes in the context of reducing technical and commercial losses, recovering costs, improving efficiency and ensuring sustainability. 
13. The Government of Cabo Verde has elected energy security, price stability and reduction of the energy bill as central concerns, duly established in the PEDS, in line with SDGs 7, established measures to be taken through the National Program for Energy Sustainability aiming to make the transition to a secure, efficient and sustainable energy sector, reducing dependence on fossil 
fuels and ensuring universal access and energy security. The electricity access rate reached 90%, meaning only about 10 out of 100 people are in a situation of energy exclusion, belonging to the disadvantaged social strata and population of remote areas of Cabo Verde. Ensuring access to electrical power for all people is the goal of the Government of Cabo Verde in 2021. The Government approved the legal regime of the social tariff for electricity as a measure to protect consumers of electricity in situations of economic vulnerability. Energy efficiency is a challenge to be overcome, and the sector's resilience and sustainability conditions are still lacking, in particular this challenge can be overcome by combating the high level 
of non-technical losses and improving the operational efficiency of energy production, transportation and distribution. Cabo Verde's strategy is to increase the sector's resilience to external shocks by reducing energy dependence on imported fossil fuels, with the largescale exploitation of renewable energy potential in the country. The production of renewable energy has made significant progress with a penetration rate of 16.9% in 2017 and the use of the great potential of endogenous renewable resources, notably the wind and solar component, is acknowledged as being strategic for reducing the electricity and water cost, increasing energy security and competitiveness and national economy diversity. 

14. In Cabo Verde, real GDP per capita grew by 2.7% in 2017, continuing the trend started in 2016, a year in which it grew 2.6%, reversing the trend of previous years. The Cabo Verdean economy remains vulnerable to climate change and drought, remaining also the structural characteristics of subsistence farming, and this should be an important milestone of economic and environmental sustainability and in order to build its resilience it must take the front line of priorities. The annual rate of change in real GDP per person employed increased in 2017, after two years of decline, with the unemployment rate reaching 12.2% in 2017. Agriculture is the sector of activity that creates the most employment, followed by trade, except in periods of drought as was the case in 2017. 
15. The PEDS began a new study on the housing situation, with the reassessment of the basic and extended housing deficit as well as the definition of a new national housing policy. The main housing problem in Cabo Verde has to do with housing insecurity, that is to say, with the degradation of housing, especially in rural areas and among poor families, since at least 64 out of every 100 live in houses with problems of roof infiltration and with infiltration and moisture problems in walls.  Cabo Verde is a country where the urbanization process, especially for African standards, is quite advanced, with about 68% of the population living in the cities. Urban profiles of all Cabo Verde cities have already been developed. Regarding the national urban profile, the informal risk area increased significantly, and surpassed 40% in 2015. The State of Cabo Verde adopted in 2017 the National Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction covering the period 2017-2030, in line with the time horizon of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 and the Africa and ECOWAS Action Plans for Disaster Risk Reduction which cover all types of risks.  The Government has developed and is implementing a National Policy for Territorial Planning and Urban Development, in the light of the New Urban Agenda (2016-2036), while at the same time preparing the National Housing Policy, which will be valid for 20 years.
16. The Government of Cabo Verde presented in 2017 the Third National Communication on Climate Change. Climate change has a diversified impact on the economy, on ecosystems, and on the present and future of Cabo Verde. Agricultural productivity has shown great sensitivity to the year to year change in rainfall. Outbreaks and pest movement may be conditioned by temperature and precipitation variability. The same can be said for the health sector, with the spread of diseases related to regional climate variability. In recent decades, Cabo Verde has made significant progress in its climate strategy, guided by a wide range of strategic plans and instruments. Environmental and climate change education has been institutionalized, awareness has been increased, and human and institutional capacities on mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning on climate change have been strengthened. Cabo Verde ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1995 and has since made a commitment to formulate, among other documents, a National Communication on Climate Change to the Conference of the Parties, 

13

which reports on the national circumstances in which the country evolves in terms of actions in the field of climate change and this includes ratification of the Paris Agreement.
17. The SDGs are leading to the implementing countries of statistical burdens which are a major challenge, especially because of the principle of 'leaving no one behind', therefore, to meet this principle and ensure the statistical production that the SDG requires, the production of statistics with less frequency and greater regularity will be necessary. The National Statistical System has adopted the production of data for the follow-up of the PEDS and the SDGs as one of its strategic objectives, thus meeting the United Nations mandate on statistics production taking into account the indicators framework for the follow-up to the 2030 Agenda. The budget for the National Strategies for the Development 
of Statistics 2017-2021 is approximately US $23 million. It has large statistical operations in accordance with the internationally established periodicity, thus the Government of Cabo Verde urges the international community to take on the partnership necessary to enable NSDS 2017-2021's major priorities, so that Cabo Verde will continue to improve management development in order to "leave no one behind"; to follow the path of progress in the implementation of the SDGs, and to deepen its contribution to the development of statistics worldwide, in particular through the Praia Group of statistics on governance. 
18. As a result of the evaluation of the results in terms of achieving the MDGs, the national development strategies and the implementation of the SDGs, the challenge facing Cabo Verde is creating a favorable environment for the implementation of the transformation and the 
Sustainable Development Strategic Plan post-2015. The analysis of MDG progress pointed to the need for a development agenda that would consolidate the gains achieved while allowing a qualitative leap in development. Lessons learned from the achievement of the MDGs underscore the importance of investing in a permanent mechanism to track progress, fulfillment, and escape specific demand at key moments of analysis and accountability. The establishment and reinforcement of post-2015 SDGs monitoring mechanisms and capacities should be addressed from the outset in a small country context to ensure the continued health of national planning and to combine competing priorities that put pressure on the Public Administration, proportioned to the size of the country, with the availability of limited resources and capabilities.

On 25 September 2015, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the resolution "Transforming our world: the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda" with 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 targets to be implemented by all countries. The effective implementation of 2030 Agenda presupposes the integration of SDGs into public policies and planning processes at national and local levels, as a guarantee of assigning objectives, aiming for the national targets, and alignment.  
In the words of the then Secretary-General of the United Nations, \0xB4the 17 Sustainable Development Goals 
INTRODUCTION\0xAA
16
leaders and peoples\0xAA, as such, sustainable development assumes three dimensions: economic sustainability, social sustainability and environmental sustainability, and an essential assumption of inclusion, meaning to leave no one behind, with a commitment that the world's economies produce enough wealth for no one to be poor, when there are capacities in the fields of education for no one to be illiterate, capacities in health care for nobody to go without basic care, and in matters of food production so that no one goes hungry, among others. The poverty that still rages in the world, is not a problem of resources, but above all of equity.   
Cabo Verde is part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Following 
17
a successful path towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), in which the country will have achieved important progress in achieving all the MDGs and will achieve all the MDGs, together with its graduation from the list of LDCs and rating as a Middle Income country. As a small SIDS island state, Cabo Verde has been confronted with major challenges, particularly in light of the declining level of international financial resources, therefore requiring the continued support of the international community to escape the so-called \0xECmiddle-income trap.
Faced with challenges for the post 2015 and based on lessons learned from the MDG review, the Cabo Verde 2030 Agenda was extensively discussed in Cabo Verde prior to adoption. In 2013, Cabo Verde conducted a series of consultations on the MDGs and the post 2015 agenda, in order to assess the current state of development, while preparing for the post 2015 horizon. One of the main objectives of these national consultations was to give less-favored groups the opportunity to express their aspirations for the future. The national consultation process has contributed to the development of a post 2015 development agenda, and best represents the aspirations and needs of the poorest and most vulnerable people.
In this context, Civil Society Organizations, include youth leaders, leaders for gender equality, urban and rural youth, children in academic settings and in childcare institutions, the children belonging to Children's Parliament 2012, Social Groups in Poverty, represented by women, youth and children, Private Organizations, represented by leaders of professional associations of women entrepreneurs, Parliamentary Networks and diversified segments of society connected through social networks. During this consultative process on the agenda post 2015, the main development priorities identified in the surveys include: (i) Improvement of health services; ii) Improved quality of education; iii) Less crime and violence; and (iv) more job opportunities, especially among young people. 
Likewise, seeking a national consensus on Cabo Verde's perspective in 2030, the government promoted a National Forum in May 2014, which identified the urgent need to prioritize the Sustainable Development Goals. In June 2015, the High Level Conference on SDGs in Small Island Developing and Middle Income States would be held in Praia. The event, organized by the government of Cabo Verde in collaboration with ONE UN, aimed to contribute toward the global discussion regarding SIDS and enhance policy thinking by discussing the various aspects of SDGs and how they relate to Small Island Developing States (SIDS) on the african continent. All African SIDS, including Guinea-Bissau, were invited. Representatives from the Comoros, 
Mauritius, S\0x201Eo Tome and Principe and Seychelles participated in the Praia Conference.
The High-level Conference also adopted a final document, "The Praia Declaration", highlighting the major concerns of African SIDS, and urging that these concerns be duly reflected in the Addis 
Ababa Conference on Financing for 
18
Development, which took place in July 2015, and the SDGs Signing Conference held in New York in 2015. 
The SDGs were in this way disclosed early on at the authority level and at the top of the civil society organizations, and as a result, visibly permeated the program of the Government of the IX Legislature and consequently is one of the main reference points of the Strategic Plan for Sustainable Development 2017-2021 (PEDS).
The National Strategic Plan sets challenging targets for the 2017-2021 period in a consistent long-term approach based on four structuring objectives: (1) to make Cabo Verde a circulating economy in the Mid-Atlantic; (2) ensure economic and environmental sustainability; (3) ensuring social inclusion and reducing inequalities and asymmetries; (4) strengthening sovereignty, creating value in democracy and orienting diplomacy to the challenges of the country's development.
To achieve the 4 prescribed objectives, the PEDS programs are grouped into 3 pillars: Pillar 1 Economy, aims at a new model of economic and environmental growth. Pillar 2 Social Status, to ensure human capital, quality of life and combat inequalities and asymmetries. And Pilar 3 Sovereignty, seeks a new state model for the strengthening of sovereignty, creating value in democracy and orientation of diplomacy to the challenges of the country's development.
The Government recognizes the need and the high importance of adopting integrated environmental policies to ensure the sustainable management of environmental resources, to guarantee the use of an environmental quality by society, to enhance the valuation of the environment as an asset and factor of economic competitiveness of the country and in view of the balance between meeting current needs and the fair expectations of future generations. To achieve this goal, and with the environment crosscutting in PEDS, a set of commitments that translate into policy measures that should be capitalized in concrete actions by taking the maximum premise of turning words into tangible results have been established.
Gender equality is one of the fundamental principles of sustainable development and aims to ensure that women and girls, as well as men and boys, have the same opportunities for participation, access and chance to benefit from the development process. Gender crosscutting in the PEDS ensures that corrective measures are taken to address gender inequalities in different sectors, thereby promoting justice and social inclusion and the country's sustainable development. 
Cabo Verde is a country of regional asymmetries, due to its insularity, which in many cases requires the creation of basic service production units on all islands, which does not favor economies of scale. Reducing inequalities and regional asymmetries is a point of consensus among policymakers and constitutes an international commitment by Cabo 

19

Verde, as a signatory to 2030 Agenda, which asserts that no one will be left behind. The regionalization of the national strategic plan is the firm Government commitment in its territorialization. The PEDS comprise an analysis of the different regions of the country, where specific forces are addressed and weighted and regional targets established, with the aim of value creation in the islands and endogenous resources and, above all, reducing regional asymmetries.
In this sense, the PEDS was conceived in a participatory way, and efforts were made to ensure, in addition to the central public administration and local 
governments, the involvement of various national entities and institutions, including civil society and private sector organizations, and Cabo Verde's development partners. The Plan contributes to the global development agenda (2030) and was developed taking into account the alignment with the principles of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Signatory to the Sustainable Development 2030 Agenda, which advocates the SDGs, and the Accelerated Action Modes of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) - the "Samoa Pathway" and Agenda Africa 2063, Cabo Verde is committed to its integration in these plans, and national, 
sectoral and sub-national policies and strategies, as well as their implementation and monitoring. This challenge is widely declared in the Government Program for the IXth Legislature, and consequently assumed by the Strategic Sustainable Development Plan, PEDS 2017-2021, through its thematic and sectoral programs and subsequent projects.
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is the agenda of Cabo Verde, the platform to understand the present and the path to the future for these Atlantic islands.

METHODOLOGY AND PROCESS FOR 
PREPARATION OF THE REVIEW \0xAA
20
The Voluntary National Report (NVR) was coordinated by the Ministry of Finance, which is responsible for monitoring the integration of the International Development Agendas into national planning, including following the implementation of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in Cabo Verde. The National Planning Directorate of the Ministry of Finance, which is the focal point of the SDGs and mandated to coordinate the implementation of the SDGs, was supported by an interagency Working Group composed of representatives from key Ministries, public institutes, UN agencies, the private sector and civil society. The process of preparing the Report was an advisory process, the result of which was subsequently compiled by the Ministry of Finance and subject to an Atelier of socialization and validation by stakeholders.
The Cabo Verde Voluntary Report on the implementation of the SDGs covers Cabo Verde's efforts to domesticate the SDGs, including the integration of SDGs into the national, sectoral and municipal strategy, the progress made so far in implementing the SDGs and monitoring mechanisms, and the challenges and the next steps.
The report was prepared in two phases:
1. Collection of information on the implementation of the 17 SDGs; 2. Systematization of data, socialization and validation of the report.
The first phase Information collection on the 17 SDGs implementation, which lasted approximately 45 days, served to identify and mobilize sustainable development stakeholders, in the context of the evaluation exercise on the implementation of 2030 Agenda in Cabo Verde. The process began with the preparation of the Work Plan for the preparation and dissemination of the VNR and the Report annotated structure. At the same time, there was a resource needs assessment for its development. A 1st preparatory meeting was held with all stakeholders (central and local government, civil society, private sector, development partners and parliamentarians) to firstly expose the underlying mechanism behind the High Level Political Forum (HLPF) and to present the scope of the report and its preparation process, and secondly to present, discuss, and approve the VNR structure. In addition, the meeting served to share information on the contribution of each sector. The Meeting highlighted a Drafting Group, coordinated by the National Planning Directorate and made up of representatives of the Ministry responsible for Cooperation, some sectors relevant to the process, the National Statistics Institute, a representative of local governments, some United Nations agencies, private sector and civil society. Through instructions from the Drafting Group, the parties involved made their contribution by highlighting the following points:
\0xEF Brief reference on the achievement of the MDG related to the sector; \0xEF Balance for each particular SDGs and specific SDGs goals and indicators.
\0xEF Review report on the progress by indicating good practices, as well as constraints and challenges to the achievement of this SDGs and political 
21
priorities, and in particular the need for support and partnerships.
\0xEF Contribution of the sector to leave no one behind 
In the second phase, the systematization of data, socialization and validation report, led by the National Planning and focal point of SDGs direction, the drafting group drew up the draft report, based on the Handbook for the Preparation of the Voluntary National Reviews of UNDESA, together with the Secretary-General's Voluntary Common Reporting Guidelines for Voluntary National Reviews at the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), with PEDS 2017-2021 as the guiding reference. The Socialization and Validation Workshop of the SDGs UNV, which took place on June 13, 2018, allowed the reaction, concrete proposals and comments, highlighting (i) the contents, with special emphasis on the content of SDGs that concerns each (ii) considerations, with annotations and concrete suggestions for improvement to be introduced in relation to the accuracy of the language used, as well as, possibly, formatting. The comments, amendments and recommendations were incorporated into the document and the final version submitted to the Government and approved.
POLICY AND ENABLING ENVIRONMENT\0xAA
22
a) VULNERABILITY AND RESILIENCE
As a Small Island Development State, Cabo Verde's biggest challenge is to build an economy with a high level of sustainable and inclusive growth, in order to overcome the key constraints, structural vulnerabilities, external dependence, unemployment, poverty, inequality in income distribution, reduced opportunities for emigration and consequent drop in remittances.
Cabo Verde is confronted with natural vulnerabilities related to its volcanic origin, its island-made nature, its location in the Sahel region, scarcity of rainfall and lack of mineral resources. Moreover, its small territorial, demographic and economic size and its isolation from the African continent are characteristics that limit the real development possibilities. 
The Cabo Verdean nation faces numerous vulnerabilities and will have to find strategies and resources to mitigate them, or to counteract its impact, by building sustainable resiliences within the framework of 2030 Agenda. Among the major vulnerabilities it is worth highlighting the following:
The agricultural production, Cabo Verde imports more than 80% of the food its population needs and exports of goods are limited to a very small number of products. In the environmental domain, the decrease and irregularity of rainfall are at the origin of the droughts as it was in 2017, and these are the main cause of the desertification phenomenon, with devastating effects on the fragile ecosystems of the country. 
As Cabo Verde is an island low-middle income country, the effects and the impact of the climatic changes are more serious. Geographic dispersion is another vulnerability because the country is an archipelago of 10 islands, with a very steep and rugged terrain (in most islands) has extremely heavy effects on the costs of basic infrastructure, services and essential goods. The strategic location, the extension of the coastline and the exclusive economic zone make Cabo Verde particularly vulnerable to new threats, such as drug and human trafficking, illegal immigration and international crime, and this constitutes its vulnerability to security.  In the energy field, energy dependence is estimated at about 75% compared to the outside world. 
Economic vulnerability is also acute. Cabo Verde is confronted with two major additional challenges, which must be addressed at the same time, ie the challenge of securing, in the medium term and with endogenous resources, the survival of its resident population, in the context of a reduction of the Official Development Assistance (ODA) and the challenge of self-sustaining and accelerated development to respond to the legitimate aspirations of its people to higher standards of living. 
The Balance of Payments analysis shows that the balance of goods is structural and deeply deficient, consistent with the fact that Cabo Verde imports most of the goods it consumes. The balance of services, whose positive balance does not account for 50% of the negative balance of the goods balance, shows itself un-
23

able to compensate for the gap, which is exacerbated by the negative structural balance of primary income. Balance can only be achieved thanks to external transfers. This is one of the traps to which the Cabo Verdean economy has fallen, which naturally tends to reproduce and which requires a redoubled effort to be overcome. The only alternative and the real way out is to replace foreign aid with private investment. However, to be effective, this alternative requires an adequate business environment based on trust, minimizing the costs of context and sustainability.
Development financing is one of Cabo Verde's greatest challenges, with its graduation in 2007 to, the Middle 

Income Country but also taking into account the high level of indebtedness. This challenge is aligned with the Praia Declaration issued from the High-Level Conference on SDGs in the Small Island Developing States, of June 2015 that underscored the specific challenges faced by middle-income SIDS by recommending firm commitments to strengthen global partnerships to ensure that these countries have the means to implement the post 2015 development agenda.  
b) SDG OWNERSHIP AT NATIONAL LEVEL
From the beginning of the process of adoption of 2030 Agenda, Cabo Verde has actively participated in international dialogue and meetings on the post-2015 agenda and the global adoption of the new SDG agenda. At the same time, on the national level, various meetings and key strategic initiatives were held, which contributed to the creation of a process of national dialogue that began with the MDG evaluation process, the later transition to the SDGs and, now, the countryis preparation for effectively taking on the 2030 Agenda. Within this scope, a number of meetings were held, with particular emphasis:
\0xEF The High-level Conference on \0xECSustainable Development Goals in Middle Income and Small Island Developing States: Sharing experiences of MDGs toward SDGs, May 2014, Praia. Thematic such as the mainstreaming of SDGs in national development strategies; Adaptation of Planning, Follow-up and 
Monitoring of the SDGs, financing for Post-2015 development; and the Partnership Among the SIDS were largely 
24
discussed. A declaration was adopted (Praia Declaration), embracing a series of commitments, findings and recommendations regarding the integration of the SDGs in the respective countries.
\0xEF Conference on local and regional development, organized by the Municipality of Praia in November 2015. The forum was used to discuss the issue of the localization of the SDGs at the municipal level and of the 2030 Agenda alongside the main local actors, calling their attention to the need for the involvement of local government from the very beginning of the SDG mainstreaming process in Cabo Verde.
\0xEF National Seminar on Initial Reflections on the Prioritization and Mainstreaming of the SDGs and Financing in Cabo Verde, Praia, December 2015.
\0xEF Retreat by Government Ministers to debate the 2030 Global Agenda and the integration of the SDGs in national planning, June 2016, Praia. High-level reflection on the alignment of the national strategic vision with the SDGs. \0xEF First Conference of the Small African Island Developing States and Madagascar (SIDSAM), held on 17 December 2016, in Cabo Verde, which brought together countries such as Cabo Verde, Comoros, S\0x201Eo Tom\0xC8 e Pr\0xCCncipe, Guinea-Bissau, Mauritius and Seychelles and, as an observer, the Joint Office of the United Nations System in Cabo Verde and which institutionalized the SIDSAM Group as a Platform for the Concertation of common interest issues and the promotion of channels and ways to overcome barriers and make effective recommendations and commitments at regional and global level, with respect to island countries.
\0xEF The organization and celebration in 
Cabo Verde, City of Praia, from 17 to 20 October 2017, of the IV World Forum of Local Economic Development. Under the motto \0xECLocal Economic Development as a means to achieve equality, equity and cohesion within the Sustainable Development Goals localization framework, the Forum examined and reflected upon Local Economic Development as a basis for integrated and cohesive territories, resilient and peaceful societies in fragile context and for sustainable and inclusive economies. Furthermore, it had a special focus on the issue of Small Island Developing States.
In a glance, the process of the elaboration of the 2017-201 National Sustainable Development Strategic Plan was also a crucial moment for the integration of the SDGs in the national planning process. The PEDS aligned the targets and indicators of each Strategic Objective from the PEDS logical framework with the SDG targets and indicators. The process was a very participatory one and, in its various phases, involved a wide range of stakeholders, including local government, civil society, national legislators, academia, the private sector and donors. A number of consultations were held at a national level through forums, workshops, seminars and meetings with representatives of the various different sectors and with all of the stakeholders in the SDG integration process. An online platform was also created to allow for greater consultation and participation on the part of citizens. A PEDS Consultation Council was also created, counting among its members the President of the Cabo Verdean Institute of Gender Equality and Equity.
c) INTEGRATION OF SDGS WHITHIN THE NATIONAL PLANNING FRAMEWORK
National 
A key principle that guided the development of the Sustainable Development Strategic Plan 2017 -2021 (PEDS) was the alignment with the Government Program (GP), aiming to implement the Program (strategic areas) and the government's vision, expressed in the Government Program for the IX Legislature 2016 
-2021. The alignment of the PEDS with 
economy
New model for economic growth 
(Sectorial Recentring Structural Reforms)

the Government Program ensures the implementation of the sustainable growth agenda and development of interventions aimed at promoting private sector investment in order to grow the economy, achieve full employment and improve the quality of life of the population, contributing to the achievement of the future vision that is: \0xECA Cabo Verde that is developed, inclusive and democratic, open to the world, modern, safe, where full employment and complete freedom prevails. The PEDS consists of four (4) Strategic Objectives, distributed in thirty-five (35) programs, grouped into three (3) pillars (economy, social and sovereignty) aiming at the 
thematic pillars
social
Human Capital, Quality of Life & 
Combatting Inequalities 
(People)

25
materialization of the GP, as well as the international development agendas and the commitments made by the Government of Cabo Verde.  In this sequence, the pillars and programs are linked to the SDGs to which they contribute. Regarding the PEDSis logical framework, it is noted that 74,4 % of PEDSis impact indicators are SDGis indicators, allowing the integrated monitoring and evaluation of the planning instruments.   
 
Sectoral
Considering that the sectors are part of the National Planning System structure, sectoral plans must obey the same rules, principles and processes carried 
Sovereignty
New model for de state
(Diplomacy and Scurity)

out within the scope of national planning, including alignment with Global Development Goals. In addition to the alignment of the PEDS with the Government Plans, it is also important to align the PEDS with the Sector Plans and the budget. It should be noted, however, that the experience gained in Cabo Verde, similar to other countries in the process of developing strategic plans, is a weak integration of the Global Strategic Plans with the Sectoral Plans, the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and the Budget process in general. 
Under this order, it should be emphasized that the sectors guarantee the effective implementation of projects, units and programs through interventions aimed at obtaining a set of products, ensuring the achievement of the objectives of strategic programs (PEDS) and sustainable development (SDGs), as well as the achievement of goals, indicators of results (effects) and impact at all levels (Sectoral, National and Global - SDGs), in an integrated and upstream manner of policy implementation.  
One of the examples of alignment of strategies and of the Sustainable Development Goals is education planning, within the 2017-2021 time frame, which is an integral part of the Sustainable Development Strategic Plan (2017-2021) - PEDS, in line with the Government and the United Nations Development Agenda, which established the Sustainable Development Goals - SDGs in the field of Education, set until 2030. 
The methodological framework, the Program approach and the Monitoring and 
26
Evaluation component were based on the guidelines of the National Planning Directorate, of the Ministry of Finance, in accordance with the Basis for the Formulation of the Sustainable Development Strategic Plan 2017-2021, The Ministry of Finance (January 2016), debated and came to a consensus in several bilateral and other working meetings.1 
The educational project, underway at the Ministry of Education (ME), is reviewed in the SDGs (2016-2030), and should contribute to the overall achievement of all the objectives in the transversal areas of poverty reduction, gender equality, inequality reduction, sustainable consumption and health.
 Local
As the IV World Economic Development Forum concluded, the location of the SDGs is the guarantee of its successful completion and there is no other way. The planning based on the SDGs, the appropriation by the local actors and the effective implication of these carry out the territorialization. The regionalization of the PEDS is effectively a mechanism for locating this plan, so it contributes for this reason that no one is left behind and thus for the realization of the SDGs. The regionalization of the PEDS favors the strengthening of capacities in the Municipalities and by this way the management of proximity that contributes not to leave anyone behind
The regionalization of the Sustainable Development Strategic Plan 2017-2021 has as its main objective to support the decision to valorise the potential of each region and to correct regional asymmetries.  It deepens the knowledge of the demographic dynamics, resources, productive capacity and economic potential of the islands, favors the dynamization of the islands' economies, positive discrimination, improves the focus of social transfers, reduces regional inequalities and asymmetries, favors convergence and commitment to the islands.
Goal setting for each region is important to ensure, as set by the Sustainable Development Goals (2030 SDGs) that no one will be left behind, or even no region will be left behind. The setting of targets for each region implies the public effort to reach them at their level and consequently at the national level. This deepens the commitment to balanced development, with the correction of asymmetries and, in short, to the realization of SDGs. 
It has been demonstrated by the regionalization of the PEDS that with the territorialization of public policies, development programs and goals it is possible to quickly promote positive discrimination and begin to reduce inequalities and regional asymmetries. The reform of the State by regionalization is essential for the management of proximity, the comprehensiveness of all so that no one is left behind. Leave no one behind is also an imperative of access and political participation and in decisions. 
With regionalization, more possibilities of election for political mandates open up, and various parties can access regional power as opposed to exercise, and this also reinforces the sharing of power, essential for the accountability of political parties and politicians in general. This will contribute to the consolidation of democracy, but also in the political forum, "No one is left behind" and even gives the citizen more space for participation in the decision, as well as permanent control of the elected and the enjoyment of their rights.
Location of SDGs at Municipality level: The Platform Program 
The platforms program aims at the creation of local platforms that ensure the local articulation between economic activities and social services and also the link between the national policies the Sustainable Development Objectives and their implementation at the local level. Indeed, municipalities in Cabo Verde do not always have the human, organizational, material and financial resources to carry out the skills transferred to them by the Central State. At the territorial level, there are no operational consultation structures involving the various actors of development in an integrated way, and the lack of a common platform that brings together actors prevents the necessary development of synergies. No one is left behind in the Strategic Municipal Plans for Sustainable Development.  The platforms are reviewing existing local and regional plans in order to identify the main needs, priorities, gaps and inter-sectoral links of the territory and their relationship with the SDGs and the national priorities. 
Thus through the SEMCs the municipalities of Cabo Verde ensure that their priorities within the SDGs frameworks are relevant and locally owned and that they include the interests of different levels of government and local stakeholders, including minorities and vulnerable groups. For this, the local platforms are also encouraging the Cabo Verde Diaspora to participate in the strategic planning process.   The local plans and from 2019 regional plans (at island level) can provide a comprehensive view of the territory and define strategies based on an integrated and multidimensional approach to inclusive and sustainable development. Therefore, the local platforms will contribute to \0xECleaving no one behind
d) LEAVE NO ONE BEHIND
Cabo Verde country of opportunities for all
Cabo Verde has made remarkable progress in its almost 43 years of independence, rated since 2007 as a Middle-Income Country, however it continues being a country of profound inequalities and of regional asymmetries that have persisted over the last 78 years. The implementation of 2030 Agenda should be an opportunity not to continue to leave them behind but also not to allow new groups to be left behind. Action must be early, starting with those farthest behind. 
27
THOSE WHO RISK BEING LEFT BEHIND
The poor and especially those living in extreme poverty
Poverty in Cabo Verde is not a problem of insufficient resources, but especially of distribution. Thus, in the case of a middle-income country and the level of global consumption expenditure, it can be inferred that the 179,909 poor were left behind, and especially 54,395 of them living in extreme poverty. The poor in Cabo Verde live on less than $ 2.6 a day in urban areas and $ 2.2 a day in rural areas. Of the 179,909 poor, 54,395 live in extreme poverty, that is, less than US $ 1.3 a day in urban and rural areas. Women make up the majority (53%) of the poor population as well as the majority (54%) of the population in extreme poverty, especially in rural areas. The poor population is young because about 60% of the poor and 63% of the very poor population are under 25 years of age, with children under the age of 15 accounting for about 380% of the poor. The island of Santiago is the largest pockets of poverty housing about 59 out of 100 poor, with special emphasis on the municipality of Praia where 22 out of 100 poor people live in Cabo Verde.
Young people from the islands without higher education institutions
Notwithstanding Cabo Verde's success in the field of education and its consequent upward social mobility, the income level determines inequities in access to higher education. In 2014 the total expenses of higher education reached 22,953,993 


usd being 16,512,951 financed by the students and 6,441,042 as a contribution of the State that includes 3,126,902 of scholarships of FICASE. Public and private higher education institutions are based in the cities of Praia, Assomada and Mindelo, and this determines access and permanence in higher education.  In the academic year 2014/2015 more than two out of three higher education students came from the Island of Santiago (62.1%) and from S. Vicente (16.1%). Thus, the opportunities of access and permanence in higher education of the young people of the islands of Santiago and of San Vicente are far superior to those of the young people of the other islands. 
Families with problems of access to piped water or electricity 
In Cabo Verde, the vast majority of the population live in households with 
access to basic services, in particular almost all of them (90%) with electricity and the majority in households with public water (64%). However, about 20% of the poor, and 30% of those living in extreme poverty, lack access to electricity, particularly in rural areas, and only 51 out of every 100 poor households get water mainly from the public grid. Thousands of poor households are often without power and public water network because of high tariff level.
People with special educational needs who have difficulty accessing education 
About 83% of the population with disabilities can read and write, about 14 percentage points below the population without disability. Only 2822 people with disabilities attend a public or private educational institution, against 133,000 people with-
out disabilities. Attending public or private education, especially those with a low level of disability, most pre-school, primary and secondary school teachers are not able to deal with children with SEN.  In Cabo Verde, people with visual, motor or hearing disabilities face physical, architectural and mobility barriers. Both housing and services buildings have no access, movement and hygiene functionalities adapted to these people. Thus, on a smaller scale in education and health, but especially in terms of accessibility and urban mobility, part of the population with disabilities is in danger of being left behind, aspects that must be properly addressed in the new urban agenda.

PUBLIC POLICIES MAINSTREAMED TO \0xB4Leave no one behind\0xAA
Leave no one behind: Birth registration
Until the late 1990s, late birth registration reached alarming levels, but it was overcome through a compact of legislative measures, mechanisms to facilitate registration and the fact that almost all births now occur in health facilities, where there is a post of civil registration. Today at least 97% of children have birth registration. A child without birth registration is potentially an excluded child, which can be left behind. A child without birth registration is potentially an excluded child, which can be left behind. 
Leave no one behind and the inter-island maritime transport program
One of the great constraints of Cabo Verde is the movement of people and goods in the national territory, a situation that undermines the promotion of economic development, the creation of opportunities for economic growth, the unification of the national space, the fight against poverty and the improvement of conditions of population life. The Government has been restructuring the sector with the elaboration of a Marine Policy Charter (CPMaR), document that summarizes the strategic options and policy measures for the 2018-2021 horizon in the field of marine affairs, with the ambition to promote competitiveness of the maritime economy. The Inter Maritime Islands Transports - TMIL is one of the first actions aimed at an efficient management of the market from the origin to the final consumer. The Government also approved the Maritime Safety Charge and amended the diploma that creates the Autonomous Fund for the Safety and Development of Maritime Transport (FADSTM), granting greater scope for the sustainability of the transport system. Quality inter-island maritime transport contributes to market integration, with an impact on employment, income distribution and the reduction of inequalities and poverty.  They facilitate access to health services and the attendance of higher education in nearby islands, but also cultural, sporting and social exchanges and thus shorten distances, unite Cabo Verdeans and contribute to "Leaving no one behind
Leave no one behind. The role of the blue economy
The sea is an important source of economic growth for Cabo Verde, contributing to food security, employment, mobility of people and goods among others. The PEDS acknowledges that one of the vectors of Cabo Verde's dynamic integration in the World Economic System is the "Cabo Verde Maritime Platform" program, which is a platform for service provision in the Middle Atlantic. Adopted in 2015, THE 
LETTER IN FAVOR OF THE BLUE ECONOMY marks the country's engagement to sustainable development of ocean and coastal areas. With the blue economy, the Government of Cabo Verde intends to develop fishing and aquaculture, blue 
29
energy, Blue Biotechnology and develop knowledge of the marine environment. We have thus chosen the sea as a way to produce wealth, employment and distribution and income. Cabo Verde is mainly ocean and it is in the ocean that we must also try to build our resilience, namely for the production of water mitigating the irregularity of the rains, as for the production of energy from an alternative source with inexhaustible resources that the sea confers.  The blue economy will contribute to "Leaving no one behind"
Leave no one behind: Official statistics
The SDGs are leading to the implementing countries of statistical burdens which are a major challenge, especially because of the principle of 'leaving no one behind', therefore, to meet this principle and ensure the statistical production that the SDG requires, the production of statistics with less frequency and greater regularity will be necessary. The National Statistical System has adopted the production of data for the follow-up of the PEDS and the SDGs as one of its strategic objectives, thus meeting the United Nations mandate on statistics production taking into account the indicators framework for the follow-up to the 2030 Agenda. The budget for the National Strategies for the Development of Statistics 2017-2021 is approximately US $23 million. It has large statistical operations in accordance with the internationally established periodicity, thus the Government of Cabo Verde urges the international community to take on the partnership necessary to enable NSDS 2017-2021's major priorities, so that 

Cabo Verde will continue to improve management development in order to "leave no one behind"; to follow the path of progress in the implementation of the SDGs, and to deepen its contribution to the development of statistics worldwide, in particular through the Praia Group of statistics on governance. 
Leave no one behind: The Single Social Registry
The Single Social Registry implemented with the partnership between the United Nations (ILO) and the World Bank is a permanent instrument for the mapping of vulnerable families; for monitoring the situation of families and will be the only reference for social transfers, social school action, social pension, social inclusion income, social rates for water and energy, the moderating fee or health services, among others. To this moment, approximately 75,000 individuals in 19,000 households have been registered. The Single Social Registry is a powerful tool, which will contribute to \0xB4leave no one behind\0xAA.
Leave no one behind: Income transfer programs. 
Taking into account that poverty has a mainly urban and female profile, the Cabo Verdean Government adopted policy measures centered on an intervention focusing strategy for poor or vulnerable families, with special attention to the areas and municipalities with higher social vulnerability. The Government created an income access program comprising the Social Inclusion Income and the Social Pension. The Social Inclusion Income (SII) is a direct monetary transfer to people and is aimed for individuals and households with children under 15 years living in extreme poverty, belonging to the active population but not engaged in an income-generating economic activity. The Social Pension is intended for people aged 60 or more years with annual income below the threshold of poverty, devoid of any social security plans, national or foreign. The social pension covers approximately 21,771 people across the country.
Leave no one behind: National Care System
The National Care System is one of the Cabo Verdean Government's strategies aimed at not leaving women behind and formulated as a central public policy in fighting gender inequalities. In 2017, the National Plan for Care was approved, with 6 strategic objectives: (i) increase the network of support for families with dependent care; (ii) create a normative and administrative landmark for the care system; (iii) create a training plan in care, establish a database of professionals by municipality, identify women caregivers that can be trained; (iv) create a network of internal and external communication; (v) create a management access, information and knowledge system; and (vi) ensure a sustainable and solidarity-based financing system. One of the first National Plan for Care activities was the creation of the Professional category for children and dependent caregivers (elders and people with deficiency.)
Leave no one behind: Access to electricity, water and sanitation
Recognizing that the high level of electricity and water rates constitutes a substantial burden on the expenditure of economically vulnerable households, the Government's program gives particular importance to issues relating to the protection of electricity and water consumers in a situation of economic vulnerability, including the adoption of a social rate for the sector. The Govern-

31

ment created the social electricity and water rate that benefits economically vulnerable clients, families enlisted in the single social registry with low income. It should immediately benefit more than 30,000 Cabo Verdean fami-
lies. The fare will allow universal access to electricity and water for domestic consumption and will discourage the illegal connections and unpaid consumption, contributing to the reduction of commercial losses for energy distributors, water and sanitation. 
Leave no one behind: Extension of social security coverage 
Since 2003, Cabo Verdean legislation has established the principle of the universality of social security coverage, 
and within the framework of the PEDS, the Government has set the goal of extending coverage to all categories of population not yet covered and promoting measures to extend the coverage of social protection to regions and populations with low coverage. Coverage of 60% of the employed population, in line with SDG 1, 5, 8 and 10. The length of the contributory coverage is a structuring inclusion program that will contribute to better access to health, ensure the continuity of income, including at the end of the working life and will help to reduce inequalities and poverty, but also to the mobilization of national savings and financing of the economy and contribute to \0xECleaving no one behind.

SDG 1. END POVERTY IN ALL ITS FORMS EVERYWHERE
Data from INE for 2015 point out that in Cabo Verde about 35.2% of the population is poor, according to the poverty threshold of 946 and 810 dollars a year in the urban and rural area, respectively. In addition, it is noted that 10% of the population lives in extreme poverty, with less than $492 per year in the urban area, or $488 per year in rural area. Both absolute and extreme poverty has greater incidence in rural areas where 49% of the population is poor and about 20% live in extreme poverty.  51% of the poor population lives in the urban areas and extreme poverty is especially concentrated in rural areas where 68 in 100 individuals live in this deprivation situation live. 
In Cabo Verde, women represent 53% of the poor population as well as the 54% of the population in extreme poverty. The predominance of women in the poor population is even more sensitive in rural areas, where approximately 53 out of 100 poor are women who also represent about 54% of the population living in extreme poverty. Furthermore, poverty affects mainly the younger population (under the age of 25), with about 60% of the poor and 63% of the population living in extreme poverty. The poor are concentrated in the biggest population centers. Thus, the municipality of Praia, the capital of the country, concentrates 22% of the population in this situation of deprivation, followed by S\0x201Eo Vicente, with 11% of the poor, and Santa Catarina (10%) and Santa Cruz (10%).
34
In terms of education, the situation of girls is clearly advantageous in relation to boys, whether poor or not, because their attendance is higher, they have less dropouts and perform better. About 52.1% of girls are not poor and 38.4% of the ones that are poor attend school, against 43.9% of the boys are not poor and 35.4% of the ones that are poor, indicating the fact that there were relatively more boys outside the education system than girls. The vast majority (74.4%) of this poor youth attend or attended the secondary level and only 2 in every 100 attend or attended professional/higher education. Young girls have a higher level of education, with 76.5% of the non-poor and 79.1% of the poor with secondary education, compared to 75.9% of the non-poor boys and 69.4% of the poor ones.   
The size of the household is also a determinant of poverty. Thus, the poor households have on average 5,5 people, being 6.1 people among those who live in extreme poverty.  A little less than half (47%) of poor households are single-parent households, but it is important to note that more than 88% of the poor households represented by women have at least one child under the age of 15 and the majority (61%) are single-parent type households.  

35














Both absolute poverty and extreme poverty has a higher incidence among households represented by women. About 39% of the population living in households represented by women are poor, whereas for households represented by men it is 31%. In the rural area, 51% of households represented by women are poor, and these surpass those of men also in urban areas ((32%)). 
Representatives of poor households are mostly women (60.5%), are in average 48.6 years old, and have no training, or education level. Even though more than half are literate, with bigger expression in the urban area, these have 3,8 years of study on average, that is, possess a low level of instruction, compared to the ones that are not poor, with 7,7 years of study on average. Even though they have low level of education, poor household representatives embark on a sensitive effort to educate their dependents, who have an average of 8.9 years of schooling nationwide. Agriculture, livestock and fishing are the main economic activities in rural areas and are the ones that most expose the rural populations to poverty (46%). On the other hand, in the urban environment is the trade that represents more risks of poverty (26%).  
In Cabo Verde the great majority of the population lives in homes with access to basic services. Almost all (99%) live in classic accommodations, with electricity (90%) and the vast majority in households with piped water (64%), sanitary facilities (80%) linked to sewers or septic tank (80%) that evacuate the solid waste through containers or cars and garbage (77%), with television (78%), cooking gas (74%) and significantly, (48%) with internet at home.
However, access to basic services, especially housing insecurity, are important dimensions of poverty deprivation. At least 1 in each 5 poor people, and 30 in 
 VOLUNTARY NATIONAL REPORT ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
each 100 people living in extreme poverty lack access to electricity, in particular those from rural areas. Only 51 out of 100 poor households get water primarily from the public network. Only 55% of poor households and 40% of the extremely poor have access to sanitation. The vast majority (72%) of poor households reside in their own accommodation, but they present some problems of habitability such as water infiltration in the ceiling (64%) and walls (62%), rotting windows (39%) and 59% of these dwellings are located on unpaved streets. The possession of land for agriculture foreshadows the exposure to poverty, since roughly 39% of poor households and 52% of those living in extreme poverty have land for agriculture, with special emphasis on rural areas where 64 out of 100 poor households have this asset.  
In 2017, 92,44 workers were enrolled as active insured, equivalent to a coverage rate of 45% of the working population. The total of beneficiaries reached 231,938 that same year, the equivalent of about 43% of the resident population. The installments cover immediate benefits such as family subsidy, medical assistance and medication, including evacuation when decided by the health authority, illness and maternity subsidy, invalidity pension, old-age pension or survival, and from now on also the unemployment benefit for employees. 
The intervention of the tax-paying social security is determinative in the financing of part of the expenditures in the Cabo Verdean health, but also it creates an important market niche for the private sector, which is the greatest mobilizer 

of national savings, and biggest institutional investor in the country, with determining intervention in the countryis strategic companies.  The non-contributory plan provides for a monthly pension of $55.1 and medicine coverage with an annual ceiling of $21.6 covering individuals aged 60 years and over, as well as children from poor families with disabilities or chronic disabling illness less than 18 years of age, belonging to households with an income below the poverty line, deprived of coverage of any national or foreign social security plans. It covers about 21,000 beneficiaries, with the elderly being the majority.  
In order to reduce poverty in Cabo Verde, economic growth of at least 5% per annum is needed, which also results in a substantial generation of employment capable of reducing inequalities, in the context of low inflation, which means less than 5%, accompanied by active social transfer policies with proper focus and special attention to health and education. 
Inclusive economic growth Since 2016, the economy resumed its growth trajectory, driven mainly by the improvement of the business environment marked by measures tending to promote favorable taxation and to revolutionize the economy financing, as well as the improvement of the external context, especially in the Euro Zone.
Aimed at promoting entrepreneurship through Start-up, the Youth Start-up program is for young people aged 1835, with higher education or vocational training and builds on incentives to offer 
36
young people new job opportunities and to develop their own business with training activities, financing of projects on advantageous conditions, follow-up on project implementation and incubation of companies. 
Financing microfinance institutions worth approximately 1 million dollars is also a program that promotes entrepreneurship, oriented to the promotion of competitiveness and sustainability of microfinance sector in order to create the conditions to access financial products and services adjusted to the needs and capacities of segments of the population excluded from the formal financial system and micro and small businesses. This mechanism is developed in partnership with commercial banks that assess risk and manage finance and the Microfinance Association that is also the recognition of the role of the social economy in fostering employment (youth and women) and the fight against poverty. 
Recognizing the problems of financing of large companies, the Government is implementing a program of funding aimed for large companies, through commercial banks at around 54 million dollars, to significantly improve the business ecosystem and contribute to the achievement of the growth target of 7% and 45,000 jobs generated by 2021.  
In Cabo Verde, the production units represent, in absolute terms, roughly 3.5 times the number of economic units and thus, those represent an important asset to the national economy, which suggests the creation of mechanisms to promote the formalization. The Government of Cabo Verde is aware that within the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals, the informal economy problem is gaining new impetus and aligns with the understanding of the international community in 104th International Work Conference session. High incidence of informal economy is a central challenge for workers' rights, including the fundamental principles and workersi rights, social protection, decent work, inclusive development and legal guarantees.

Recognizing that informality has a negative impact on the development of companies, in the collection of public revenue, in economic and environmental policies, the soundness of institutions and free competition, the Government of Cabo Verde understands that more than a problem, the informal economy is a challenge, and an opportunity, provided that there is the ability to undertake, to take risks, innovate, produce and be aware of market functioning. Thus, it created the Inter-institutional Commission for the Management of the Strategy of Transition of the Informal Economy to the Formal - GETIF, with the mission to identify the informality problem's specifics and to promote the conception and implementation of prompt and efficient solutions, to elaborate, to follow and to evaluate the inter-institutional agenda for the transition to formal economy.
The Government of Cabo Verde recognizes the need to increase the weight of the private sector in the national economy and in this sense favors reforms that promote the growth of the private sector as a state partner in the creation of employment opportunities, in the generation of wealth and income that finance the sustainable development of the Nation.  In this context, it was created PROEMPRESA, representing a new model of support for the promotion of micro, small and medium enterprises, establishing a system of different incentives that respond to the needs of these and large investors, and which creates the necessary conditions for their establishment and flourishing throughout the national territory. It must be the main desk, one stop shop for entrepreneurs and companies.
Therefore, the new ecosystem for the financing and development of entrepreneurship, of micro, small medium and large companies, also includes the Pro-capital with capital risks for successful initiatives. The creation of the Sovereign Wealth Fund at Garantia, in the private investment to promote access to finance in the capital market by large companies, and the political support of the Government allowing access from Cabo Verdean companies to financial institutions both international and regional, the development of programs designed to promote good corporate governance, public and private, as well as a pro-business environment, in society and in public administration and overall empowerment of national companies and the facilitation of financing the economy, with focus in achieving the PEDS goals. 
The program of Socio-Economic Opportunities in Rural areas- POSER: focuses on economic inclusion of the rural poor by seizing opportunities and human capital there.  The length of the contributory coverage is one of the important measures of PEDS and the strategic plan for social security.
Ending poverty also presupposes preventing risks of economic and human losses inherent to disasters. Cabo Verde adopted in 2017 the National Strategy for Disaster and Risk Reduction that provides an effective framework to manage risk, prevent disasters, minimize damage and associated losses, and avoid creating new risks, through the establishment of institutional mechanisms and capacity building for planning and implementing disaster risk reduction for building the nation's resilience.  The National Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction covers the period 2017-2030, in line with the time horizon of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 and the African and ECOWAS Action Plans for Disaster Risk Reduction which covers all types of risks arising from both natural and man-made hazards, including risks related to climate change.

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT






SDG 2. END HUNGER, ACHIEVE FOOD SECURITY AND IMPROVED NUTRITION 
AND PROMOTE SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
Cabo Verde is a country extremely vulnerable from the standpoint of food, agro-climatic variations, but also external market fluctuations. In the past few years, more than 90% of cereals (corn, rice, wheat) came from abroad, both in the form of food aid and commercial imports, and the weight of the latter tends to increase with the decrease of food aid that represents about 30% of the imports, due largely to the middle-income country status and changes in official development aid modalities. 
In Cabo Verde, hunger is not a mass phenomenon, but food unreliability exists. According to FAO, in 2017, about 13% of the population were under-nourished. The data available indicate that 20% of rural families lived in a situation of food insecurity being 13% moderately and 7% severely. This information is to be updated in the course of this year, with the Family Food Vulnerability Survey. (ISVAF, 2005). 
The country made an outstanding journey since independence, putting the food and nutritional security in the center of the Government agenda, at central, local and community levels by focusing on the planning with the preparation in 2002 of the first strategic document for food and nutritional security (ENSA), updated in 2014 for 2020, putting a greater emphasis on nutritional issues and the human right to adequate food (DHAA), whose law was approved by Parliament this month in Cabo Verde.  It is noted as an important gain, the recent approval of the strategic plan for agricultural statistics that will provide statistics essential to management of food and nutritional security, including the strengthening of governance of the National Council for Food and Nutritional Security created in 2013 to improve the mechanisms for coordination of food and nutritional safety policies. 
To ensure food and nutritional security is possible, as acknowledged by the Cabo Verdean authorities. It requires good articulation and coordination among the various stakeholders involved in the sector, as policy priorities, financing and partnerships needs are identified. THE National Food and Nutritional Security Strategy (ENSAN) by 2020 aims to ensure food and nutritional security through the achievement of the Adequate Food Human Right to the (DHAA). The ENSAN aims also to contribute to the improvement of access to water, basic sanitation and other components of well-being, to increase agricultural production and fisheries in a sustainable way, improving the food supply mechanisms, improving the income of vulnerable populations for financial access to food, developing preventive measures and treatment of nutritional disorders, nutritional supplementation, guidance and education to adopt healthy eating habits.   
Important instruments for strategic governance work towards the achievement of this important goal of sustainable development in particular, the Law on the Human Right to Adequate Food (1), the national school feeding Program (2), the National Program for Agricultural Investment, Food and Nutrition Security for the period 2018-2022, (3) the Single Social Registry, (4) the Resilience Country Priorities (RPP/ACT) of Cabo Verde for the period 2017-2021, (5) the POSER/ CLIMA Project (6) that aims to improve living conditions of the rural population in the intervention areas, particularly women and the young breadwinners, and therefore increase the resilience of the country against climate change.
According to the 2015 Agricultural Census, the agricultural structure comprises 45,399 farms, an active agricultural population of 92,322 people, of which about 71.6% is between 20 and 65 years, with a slight predominance of men (51.3%). In the last 11 years in agrarian structure, sensitive changes occurred in Cabo Verde namely the decrease in the farming population by about 40,000 people, the number of parcels at about 12% settling at 75,000. Also with an increase in the number of farms (2.1%), with slight reduction of non-irrigated land and increase of forestry, but also of the irrigated farms (22.2%), a result of large investments in water mobilization and creation of perimeters irrigated. In 2015, the agricultural area was 36,456 ha, equivalent to 9.0% of the country's land area, representing a negative variation of 1.9% in relation to 2004. Approximately 82.5% of the agricultural area is exploited. Approximately 82.5% of the agricultural area is exploited. 

 VOLUNTARY NATIONAL REPORT ON THE 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2030 AGENDA FOR 
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

Almost all farms are family-owned, with small plots making it difficult to achieve economies of scale. Agriculture is practiced in family properties with average surface of about 1.2 ha, mainly in non-irrigated land, having the combination of corn-beans as the main crops (in 95% of the cultivated land). The majority of farm parcels are in Santiago island (59%), livestock is practiced in 85.3% of farms, while the dry farming is practiced in 73.4% of these parcels. 
In the context of the implementation of the national plan for agricultural investment (PNIA of 1st generation) important achievements for the agricultural sector were met, with the construction of 7 dams which resulted in the considerable increase in the availability of water for 
irrigation. The dams, the holes, the levees and other infrastructure built mobilized roughly 30,958,000 m3 of water for agriculture in the 2013-2015 period. The management of hydrographic basins carried out in an integrated way in the five river basins provided for a total of 315 ha. 
In the last 16 years, approximately $484 million has been invested in agriculture, equivalent to an average of $ 28 million a year, also equivalent to approximately 1.8% of the GDP in 2016 and this performance testifies to the level of priority devoted to the sector. In the 2007-2015 period, agriculture contributed on average 7.3% to the GDP and therefore, the primary sector represents only 8.7% of the national wealth, a contribution that 

40

remains low, against approximately 17% for the secondary sector and 61% for the tertiary sector.  
Agriculture, livestock and fishing continue to be the main economic activities in rural areas and the ones that most expose the rural populations to poverty. Approximately 40,000 people left agriculture and the vast majority migrated to urban centers, in particular to the tourist islands. The abandonment of agriculture is thus a striking phenomenon and may indicate failure of agricultural policies, taking into account the large investments made. However, sensitive progress is being made in the mass production of new technologies such as agriculture in the greenhouse and hydroponic units. 
The development of an agricultural row approach is a priority with the awareness of the actors and the selection of more than 10 rows of vegetable and fruit crops, capacity building activities and the construction of post-harvest centers aimed at adding value, and aggregating product value, as well as support in the organization of producers and production, making possible the emergence of agricultural companies along the agricultural value chain. Post-harvest facilities will be included into an agriculture logistics and technical assistance to agricultural production company, aiming at the quality and stability of agricultural productsi prices. 
Research and development has allowed for the adaptation and development of technologies, particularly in selecting a variety of vegetables, fruits, roots and tubers, which contribute for the increase, diversification and availability of agricultural production throughout the year. 
The Government's action focuses on a paradigm shift of rural development, with the disruption of the traditional vision and setup of an era of transformation and modernization of the agricultural sector, which will be based on business agriculture, essentially turned to conquering the markets that require quality production with added value. For this reason, the following policy measures will be prioritized: To that end, the following policy measures will be prioritized:
To increase productivity and production, in addition to the investment already made in road infrastructures, another set of interventions have been put in place, related to road construction for better access and connection of the production areas with the market. The improvement of inter-island transportation is one of the aspects in which a solution is being developed to enhance national agro-livestock production. 
In order to facilitate the production and distribution of products, negotiations are under way with Cabo Verde's development partners for the creation of a large Agricultural Logistics Company; these centers will provide services directly linked to individual farmers or organized in cooperatives so as to serve as the warehouse of agricultural products towards the market.
These are short- and medium-term challenges to improve quality and the enhancement of agricultural products, the development and award of quality labels and designation of origin, and is also relevant to investment in technology, research and agricultural development.
Due attention will be given to outsourcing the activity of rural extension and technical assistance, and the strengthening of vocational training in the areas of agriculture, forestry, livestock, sector, stimulating greater entrepreneurship, especially youth looking to have an inclusive approach to gender issues. The goal is to invest in advanced techniques and existing methods of production, promoting its adaptation to the agro-ecological conditions of Cabo Verde. 
During the PEDS cycle, i.e. between 2017 and 2021, agricultural production should grow slightly. In order to sustainably increase production and productivity, farm incomes, and enhance adaptation and resilience against climate change and variability, innovations were introduced in none rain-fed agricultural practices of sub-humid and high humid areas. This approach has made it possible to increase the resistance of rain-fed practices to climatic shocks, as well as an improvement and scaled up quality production, and profitability of the farms. 
To overcome the challenge of adaptation to climate change, increased resilience and reduction of risks in the agricultural sector, interventions in climatically smart agriculture are proposed, including the use of renewable energy in agriculture, watershed planning with focus on rational management of water and soil resources, the development and adaptation of agro-forest-pastoral systems, the strengthening of research

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2030 AGENDA FOR 
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

and development, the protection of coastal zones and alternative activities for women. 
At livestock level, priority will be given to short cycle breeds. With regard to the processing of agricultural products and livestock, the guidelines move towards the valuation value added in relation to agricultural and livestock products, with emphasis on increased production of value-added processed products.  In the field of agroforestry, interventions focus on the forests of protected areas and tree-planted perimeters with anti-erosive soil protection measures. 
Biological/organic farming is an agricultural model that is gaining a great reputation in recent years due to its environmental and social character, in this context, incentives for organic 
farming and the production of bio-food for special niche markets are granted.
Promoting sustainable agriculture is one of the biggest challenges of Cabo Verde. Contributing to the appreciation of investments already carried out, particularly on mobilization of water, land use, research with integrated water resources management, including the use of treated wastewater and desalinated water produced with moderate energy costs for renewable energies, the mobilization of the youth population, and the paradigm shift for entrepreneurship. In addition, the appreciation of modern technologies and in particular the quality assurance, production regularity, in connection with the tourist market, in an efficient transportation context.

SDG 3. Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages
In the field of Health, Cabo Verde has had a successful journey and has made great progress, especially in recent years, reaching the Millennium Development Goals related to under-five mortality and maternal mortality, in 2015. In Cabo Verde, life expectancy is 80.2 years for women and 72.2 years for men. The overall maternal mortality rate was reduced to less than 70 deaths per 100,000 live births by 2015. By 2016, it was 18.8 deaths per 100,000 live births. Improvements are continuing and there appears to be no risk of regression.  
In addition, the vast majority of births are attended by qualified health professionals. Significant progress has been made in the area of reproductive health, with the average number of children per woman decreasing from seven children in the 1970s to 2.33 children per woman in 2017. And, coupled with investments in human capital and especially in education and in health in general, such progress have led to the current demographic transition. 
In 2016, there were only 17 deaths per thousand children under the age of five, and neonatal mortality was reduced in a sustainable way. The early neonatal mortality rate (0 to 6 days) was reduced from 11.2 deaths per 1000 live births in 2010 to 8.1 in 2015 and 7.6 in 2016, while late neonatal mortality (7 to 27 days) decreased from 3.1 deaths per 1000 live births in 2010 to 2.0 in 2015, standing at 2.5 in 2016.  Post-neonatal mortality has followed the same trend, reducing from 8.5 deaths per 1000 live births in 2010 to 5.3 in 2015 and 2016.  Thus, in Cabo Verde, both neonatal mortality and under-five mortality are at levels below the SDG target, and it is believed that the country may, well before 2030, end the preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years-old. 
Road accidents are relatively high and road accidents deaths accounted for 1.3% of total deaths in 2015.   
There is high coverage for prenatal care. Thus, in 2016 about 87 out of every 100 pregnant women benefited from prenatal visits with nurses and about 4.7% with doctors. Almost all (94.8%) children under the age of 1 have benefited from postnatal visits with nurses and about 10 out of every 100 with doctors. 
The success of Cabo Verde in the field of health is mainly related to the preventive aspect and especially to the high vaccination coverage of children. This is a good practice that has prevented many inequities, that is, it has reduced avoidable inequalities in health care.  By 2016, at least 91 out of every 100 children under 1-year-old had been vaccinated. This performance is due in large part to the solidarity of the international community, particularly the World Health Organization. 
The country is in an epidemiological transition phase, with chronic diseases being the main causes of death (brain/ cardiovascular diseases and cancers are the first and second main causes of death, respectively) and a significant 

 VOLUNTARY NATIONAL REPORT ON THE 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2030 AGENDA FOR 
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

incidence of infectious diseases, with the sporadic occurrence of epidemics related to vector-borne diseases given the countryis vulnerability.  Thus, the proportion of deaths attributed to circulatory system diseases has increased from about 26 out of every 100 in 2011 to 30 in 2016 and the incidence of diabetes is increasing. The deaths attributed to malignant tumors fluctuate around 13 and 14%, while deaths from respiratory diseases have increased from 9.2% in 2011 to 11.5% in 2015.   
This is a more challenging segment, considering the high costs of prolonged treatment of these chronic diseases. 
Reducing the incidence and prevalence of Priority None Communicable Diseases, with the implementation of the NHSi Health Care Quality Improvement Program, is one of the outcomes of the health sector reform and the PEDS, as regards reducing evacuations, which presupposes increasing the NHSi response capacity on all islands and overall in the country.   
In Cabo Verde, the annual expenditure on health per capita is US $83.9 and has been increasing, seeing that it was US $66.5 in 2015. This is due to the fact that public spending on health has grown at a faster pace than the average popula-
tion growth. However, this should not overshadow the more important fact, which is the share of public spending on health has decreased from 9.6% in 2015 to 7.6% in 2017, in the context of rising health costs.  
The occurrence of dengue and zika epidemics in the last 9 years and of malaria in 2017, in the Municipality of Praia, pose new challenges to health.  In 2016, the country was certified poliomyelitis-free and received the 2017 Excellence Award from the African Leaders Malaria Alliance (ALMA) for its efforts to fight malaria, and we intend to eliminate malaria by 2020. So, we are drafting a plan to 

46
eliminate it, with the support of WHO. We are developing action plans to fight vector-borne diseases, including Zika virus infection. 
The Government of Cabo Verde has elected health as one of its priority areas with a commitment to ensure a strong social policy, particularly in the health system, in order to address the issues of universality, justice, accessibility, solidarity, equity, efficiency and effectiveness, which affect people specifically.  Im-
proving health sector performance is the subject of a reforms program aimed at achieving a quality level and ensuring the availability of health care for all. 
As part of the reform, we address sector governance and institutional development, with adjustment measures aimed at adapting to the new health sector governance agenda, while strategic planning in health regions, islands and central hospitals and health sector regulation will address the private health 
sector. In terms of health care provision, the reform focuses on improving access to differentiated and quality health care with therapeutic protocols, increasing human resources, improving the capacity for diagnoses, complementary tests and medicines provision and increasing medical and hospital equipment, improving prenatal and vaccine coverage, implementing screening for cervical cancer in some health centers, strengthening public health programs, namely schools that promote health, 
48

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2030 AGENDA FOR 
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

adolescent and elderly health, and nutrition programs, and strengthening the fight against alcohol abuse and other drug use, and improving the pharmaceutical sector. 
Cabo Verde's progress in the health sector is also thanks to the cooperation, notably, technical cooperation, by the strengthening multilateral and bilateral cooperation (CPLP, countries) as well as with a number of organizations such as the West African Health Organization, the Global Fund, WHO and agencies 
such as FAO and OIE (Animal Health), UNICEF, UNFPA and the African Medicine Agency.
Technical cooperation has been strengthened, within the framework strengthening the institutional capacity of the new structure coordinating alcohol and other drugs and in the reformulation of the prevention and treatment policy on dependencies through UNODC.
The Government of Cabo Verde takes on the challenge of ensuring access to 
quality health and promoting well-being for all at all ages and, to this end, improving the health information system, increasing equipment acquisition and maintenance, increasing health research capacity, increasing financial resources, completing the implementation of the pre-hospital emergency system, improving human resources quality and capacity, and strengthening primary health care.





SDG 4. ENSURE INCLUSIVE AND EQUITABLE QUALITY EDUCATION AND 
PROMOTE LIFELONG LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL
In Cabo Verde, even before independence, education was perceived as the basis of upward social mobility and was an important emancipating resource. The quality education ambition was a permanent feature in building Cabo Verdean citizenship. This goal has been fulfilled throughout Cabo Verde's history, and education is considered a crucial factor for its development.  The country reached the MDG 2 - Achieve universal primary education and by 2016/2017, about 88 out of every 100 preschool-aged girls and 85 out of every 100 preschool-aged boys were attending preschool.
The Government of Cabo Verde aligns with the global understanding that the period of early childhood is essential for the integral development of the child throughout the childis life, and therefore foresees, within the framework of the 2017-2021 Strategic Plan of Education, to promote the access of all children aged 4-5 to preschool education.   In line with the United Nations recommendations, we preferred to start the journey early and already in 2017, making preschool education available for all children aged 4 and 5, through support for disadvantaged families in making their monthly payments and other measures, such as regulating the operation of preschool education establishments and disseminating and raising awareness with the aim of promoting access to preschool education.
 
During the last 2016/2017 school year, about 82.6% of young girls at the age to attend the second and third years of the first cycle of primary education were attending, well above boys of the same age (73.3%).  In that same school year, at least 83.8% of children and young girls from their respective age group were at the end of the second cycle of primary education, well above boys of the same age (76.3%). In addition, 70.5% of children and young girls from their respective age group were at the end of the third cycle of primary education, slightly above boys of the same age (68.6%). Although the transition between basic (6th) and secondary (7th) is particularly good (89.7%), the schooling profile indicates significant difficulties in the flow of students in secondary education. The data show that only half of those entering 7th year can reach the 10th year of schooling and only 30% successfully complete the 12th year of schooling. 
There are also high rates of failure and drop put, with greater significance at the end of cycles, being the highest among the boys. It is estimated that only one third of students enrolled in high school reach the end of this level of education, not acquiring the majority of skills for inclusion in active life and having difficulties in higher education. This profile does not, however, compromise the full achievement of this goal, that is, by 2030 to ensure that all girls and boys complete primary and secondary education.  
The extension of compulsory primary education up to the 8th year is one of the priorities of the Government duly received in the PEDS and in the Strategic Plan of Education and was effected in 2017 with the reorganization of the school system of compulsory basic education. 
The fact that higher education is offered exclusively in Santiago and S\0x201Eo Vicente leads to structural opportunity asymmetries and inequalities at the higher levels. Thus, 14 out of every 100 non-poor girls attend higher education, with only 10 out of every 100 boys belonging to this socio-economic level in this cycle. Only 3 out of every 100 poor girls and about 2 out of every 100 poor boys attend higher education. On average, poor young people have 8 years of schooling, compared to 10 years for non-poor youth. Non-poor girls have an average of 10 years of schooling and the poor have 8.7 years of schooling, being in a better position than boys, as the latter, the non-poor have an average of 9.9 years of schooling, while the poor have in average 9.3 years of schooling. 
Turning higher education into one of the country's strategic development axes, promoting fair access in a regulated manner is one of the major priorities of the Strategic Education Plan. Thus, as a way of introducing greater equity, reducing inequalities and improving the parity rate, from 0.7 to 1, the review of the law establishing the system of access to higher education, the review of the policy and the criteria for allocating scholarships and the implementation of the Distance Learning System (EaD) is foreseen among others.

 VOLUNTARY NATIONAL REPORT ON THE 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2030 AGENDA FOR 
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

The vast majority (78.7%) of primary and secondary schools are connected to the public electricity grid, thus allowing access to and use of ICTs, but access to and use of the Internet for educational purposes is still limited, since only 17 out of every 100 schools have it. Moreover, ICT penetration in education is still relatively low, with only 46% of schools having computers for pedagogical purposes. Installation of Weblabs, which are containerized laboratories adapted to accommodate classes of 12 students and a monitor, with adequate support equipment for training in various areas of the TICs.
Adequate care for children with Special Educational Needs is not yet widespread. Almost all schools (97.6%) have 
access to drinking water and sanitation facilities (98.9%), with hand washing facilities in at least 90 out of every 100 schools.
Rehabilitation and improvement of educational infrastructure is one of the priorities of the 2017-2021 Strategic Plan for Education, according to a plan to rehabilitate the school network and the Compulsory Primary Education goals.  
In Cabo Verde, almost 98.7% of primary school teachers are qualified to teach at this level. The issue of staff qualification is especially evident in preschool education, where a little less than 30 per 100 professionals are qualified to serve children.   Therefore, increasing the training and qualification of childcare 

52

workers and managers of preschool education establishments is one of the priorities of the 2017-2021 Strategic Plan for Education. 
The ongoing educational project is in line with the SDG and is expected to contribute to the overall achievement of all goals in the cross-cutting areas of poverty reduction, gender equality, inequality reduction, sustainable consumption and health. The 2017-2021 strategic plan for education is perfectly aligned with SDG 4 and foresees the implementation of reforms and investments to make this journey.   
The educational project advocates measures to combat the inefficiencies detected in secondary education, improving access, performance and giving alternatives to students. The educational project also provides for the implementation of a Mandatory Basic Adult Education model capable of ensuring the mobility of students with the formal system and articulated equally with a vocational training system, allowing to equip young people and adults with life skills, with exit profiles suitable for full integration into the labor market.
 VOLUNTARY NATIONAL REPORT ON THE 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2030 AGENDA FOR 
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
The changes that the Strategic Plan for Education advocates will focus on quality, effectiveness, aligning the educational system with the economic and social needs of the country, providing a modern education, favoring the pedagogical management centered on the student, both at central and local level. It will also focus on crossover, with effective coordination of cross-cutting issues, including special education, by adopting an inclusive education policy, gender issues to promote equal rights and opportunities in access to and success of students and teachers of both sexes, 

school health of school children and youth, school social action to improve access and equity in education, in particular socially disadvantaged students, and ICTs to expand and update access to education and information. 
The decentralization of social services to the municipalities and especially the National Care System also aims to ensure income supplement in order for all children to attend, thereby freeing mothers from this unpaid work component. 
54
With the sustained reduction in school demand, especially in primary education, the State of Cabo Verde now has room to strengthen the quality of education, but also to pay attention to children and young people with special educational needs, as well as to promote the correction of regional inequalities and asymmetries in terms of logistics, and in particular to combat school dropout, namely by giving more attention to adolescents and especially boys, and addressing relevance. Education must continue to carry out its main mission, which is inclusion and upward social mobility, and thereby combat the intergenerational transmission of poverty. This mission requires effective positive discrimination policies for islands without higher education institutions and for young people from poor families, through existing social transfers, and policies with impact on access and permanence, which require better targeting. 





SDG 5. ACHIEVE GENDER EQUALITY AND EMPOWER ALL WOMEN AND 
GIRLS
Cabo Verde has made significant progress on gender equality and equity, particularly in the context of the MDGs. Despite the progress made, women represent the majority of the poor in Cabo Verde, particularly rural women and heads of single-parent families, they are at a disadvantage in terms of unemployment and inactivity, especially young women, and there persist discriminatory social and cultural norms and practices that prevent women from participating on a level playing field in the formal job market, in decision-making and in political spheres and make them the main victims of violence and discrimination, both in the private and public spheres.  
Time poverty is a material factor that limits women's development opportunities, especially the poorest, in education and training, job search and maintenance, and to participate in public life in general. Employed women are disadvantaged in terms of quality of employment and are the vast majority of workers in informal production and domestic work.   
Cabo Verde has agreed to reach the Planet 50-50 as part of the 2030 
Agendais Sustainable Development Goals and the Government considers gender equality as a central issue for inclusive and equitable development, with it being one of the 11 priorities for the decade, and gender equality cuts across the entire Government program and the Strategic Sustainable Development Plan, representing an example of success in locating the 2030 Agenda in the national strategic plans. Cabo Verde thus demonstrates a high level of political commitment to gender equality promotion and women empowerment, 
by creating a positive political and strategic environment to promote gender mainstreaming at the highest strategic level and in terms of different sectoral plans. 
Regarding the fight against gender-based violence, mention should be made of the 2015 publication of Decree-Law no. 8/2014, which consolidates the regulatory conditions needed to fully implement the Special Law on GBV adopted by the country in January 2011. 
The GBV law has a high visibility index, varying between 69% in rural areas of Santiago Island and 88% on Fogo Island. Some 14,644 GBV complaints were filed with the National Police, of which only 1823 were men. In that same year, 16,351 GBV complaints were filed with the Countryis Prosecutor Offices. The slowness of the justice system also affects GBV cases, since there were 8418 pending GBV cases in early 2017. 
The GBV law and its application are good practice and an integrated policy, but a little less than one out of every three women victims and 28 out of every 100 men victims believe that the authorities do nothing; that is, that no measures are taken to protect the victims of GBV.   
The 2nd National Plan for Gender Equality (2015-2018), which is currently being implemented, covers the three main gender dimensions, namely economic empowerment, in line with targets 4 and 7 of SDG 5, the physical autonomy of women and girls, including the fight against GBV, health, sexual and reproductive rights, aligned with targets 2, 3 and 6, and women's leadership and political participation, corresponding to goal 5. The Plan also devotes a specific focus to strengthening and institutionalizing gender mainstreaming, as implementation targets, as a support mechanism essentially for the materialization of the goals and the sustainability of the gains. 
Regarding womenis economic empowerment, an Interministerial Group was created by a Decree-Law in 2016. This Group was to design and monitor a Program aimed at ensuring access to Income, Education, Care and Health, which it developed, and the proposal for the National Care System. The national plan to implement the National Care System represents an integrated model of co-responsibility for care among families, the State, the community and the private sector and a framework for transformative changes in women's lives, in social and family welfare, in gender equality and in human rights promotion. It is a significant step towards the materialization of women's rights and the realization of SDG, particularly target 5 of Goal 5, gender equality and women empowerment.
With regard to increasing women's participation in politics and in different decision-making bodies, the country has an important project to develop and adopt a parity law, fulfilling its commitments to PEDS, CEDAW, the Beijing Platform for Action, the African Unionis Agenda 2063 and 2030 Agendais Sustainable Development Goals, particularly target 4 of SDG 5. The law is expected to be submitted to the Cabo Verdean parliament by the end of 2018. 
On the other hand, important advances have been made in terms of institutional capacity-building to integrate gender equality into the strategic plans of important economic sectors in the country. Special mention should be made of the Gender Mainstreaming in Tourism plan, which is currently being implemented, the approval and beginning of implementation of the National Strategy of Transition from the Informal to the Formal Sector, which includes a gender diagnosis, and the National Gender Strategy for Education, Training and Employment.
Note also the ongoing regulation of domestic work, aiming at substantively improving work conditions for women, who represent the vast majority (92%) of workers in this sector, which also fulfills important international commitments. Cabo Verde initiated the implementation of gender-sensitive budgets in 2017, and is thus close to achieving indicator 5.1. 1 of the SDG 5, by institutionalizing gender markers in the Government Budget.
Important advances have been made in terms of institutional capacity-building to integrate gender equality into the strategic plans of important economic sectors in the country. One of the aspects of the Strategic Plan for Education is the promotion of a culture of equality and no gender-based violence in educational 
 VOLUNTARY NATIONAL REPORT ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

environments. The Plan also determines the cross-cutting nature of the gender approach in all programs, planning, budgeting and monitoring. On the other hand, at the municipal level and within the framework of the decentralisation process, platforms for local development are being implemented, which are strategic planning instruments in which the gender approach translates into one of the main pillars of intervention.
Thus, achieving gender equality and empowering all women and girls by 2030 is possible and is a challenge fully acknowledged by government authorities, the civil society and development partners.

SDG 6. ENSURE AVAILABILITY AND SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT OF 
WATER AND SANITATION FOR ALL
Cabo Verde has made a remarkable progress in the area of water and sanitation, far surpassing the MDG targets, despite the climate being arid and with reduced rainfall, the rugged relief condition, the high cost of water production and the losses.
In the area of water, it highlights that about 91 out of 100 people have drinking water, being 64% through the public network, however, there are notable asymmetries between, the urban area, where 69% of the population has access to the public network and the rural area with only 54%, in which 26 in 100 people do not have access to drinking water, with a slight advantage to man, 9%. In addition, it notes that there are still municipalities in disadvantage situation, such as S\0x201Eo Domingos and Boa Vista where only 47% and 35% of the population, respectively, get water form the public water network and S\0x201Eo Salvador do Mundo in which 41% of the population have safe access to drinking water.  
In the area of sanitation, it is noted the fact that only around 20% of the population do not have sanitary facilities, that is, a vast majority (80%) dispose wastewater adequately through sewage network (25%) or septic tank, which are connected to sanitation system. There are visible differences between, the urban area, where only 12% of the population do not have this device, that is, 88% of the population dispose of wastewater adequately, through the sewage system (35%) or septic tanks (52%), and the rural area with 35% of the population without access to sanitary facilities, that is, only 65% of the population have these facilities with septic tanks (62%). In Cabo Verde, individual water treatment systems, through septic tanks, are predominant, but investments are being made in sewage systems and house connections and Wastewater Treatment Plants, mitigating the risk of water contamination and favoring the use of treated wastewater. 
Cabo Verdeis climate characteristics contribute to the very limited water resources, which must be used within an integrated management framework, including the reuse of treated wastewater. Agriculture has been the largest consumer of water produced in the country. Similarly, the demand for water has increased due to the steady increase in per capita consumption, driven by population growth, urban concentration, industrialization, tourism and improved standard of living. In 2017, Cabo Verde experienced a severe drought with influence in 2018, especially regarding water availability. A plan to mitigate the effects of poor agricultural production has been adopted, and this cycle is being managed with stability thanks to international solidarity, in financing the plan with around 10 million euros. In the context of IWRM, the National Water and Sanitation Agency has been working hard to monitor water resources, especially groundwater, in order to avoid saltwater intrusion and contamination of aquifers. 
However, the modern and sustainable management of liquid waste is still a major challenge, low coverage in sewage networks and collective wastewater treatment systems. Regarding water availability, it is affected by the hilly landscape, the dry climate, price which is on average high, high energy bill, but also because it is managed by operators that should ensure the cost recovery. after adopting the Integrated Water Resources Management Action 
Plan (Portuguese acronym: PAGIRE), the State of Cabo Verde has been reforming the water and sanitation sector in order to ensure that everyone has the right to water and to promote Cabo Verde's development through integrated improvement of water supply, sanitation and hygiene conditions, safeguarding the sustainable use of natural resources and the environment, as well as social and gender equity. In this context, the institutional framework of the sector was reviewed with the approval of the New Water and Sanitation Code, creation of the National Water and Sanitation Agency (Portuguese acronym: ANAS) and the National Water and Sanitation Council (Portuguese acronym: CNAS). The National Strategic Plan for Water and Sanitation (Portuguese acronym: PLENAS) was approved by the Council of Ministers' Resolution no. 10/2015, dated February 20. 
The PLENAS establishes that, in relation to water needs to satisfy domestic uses, the Government's goals are providing access to a minimum of forty (40) liters of water per person each day and discouraging consumption of more than ninety (90) liters per person on each day, as well as reducing distances to not more than ten (10) minutes of travel for those whose homes are not connected to the public supply network. Also drafted were the Social and Gender Strategy for the Water and Sanitation Sector (Portuguese acronym: ESGAS), to be in force until 2020, the Information, Education and Communication (IEC), the Water and Sanitation Master Plans (Portuguese acronym: PDAS) of the islands of Santiago, Santo Ant\0x201Eo, Maio, Boa Vista, Fogo and Brava, but also Municipal Plans. In this context, \0xA1guas de Santiago was created. It is the water and sanitation operator on Santiago Island and actually the largest operator in Cabo Verde, since it must provide water and sanitation services to about 56% of the country's population. Water and Sanitation have been one 
 VOLUNTARY NATIONAL REPORT ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

of the priority sectors, in particular in terms of investment concentration. 
The National Strategic Plan for Water and Sanitation (Portuguese acronym: PLENAS) establishes, among other measures, that existing water sources must be managed in an integrated way, water supply and sanitation services must be financially sustainable and must cover territorial areas that maximize efficiency and are not determined by administrative limits. It considers the water and sanitation sector's financial sustainability as vital, on the assumption that the prices charged tend to ensure the recovery of costs and that all stakeholders are transparent when it comes to water and sanitation management, 

62

always safeguarding that the price of water does not limit its use, particularly for the most socio-economically disadvantaged populations.  
The integrated water resources management approach is realized namely within the legal and institutional framework at the central, municipal and community levels. Capacity building on Integrated Water Resources Management is also an important milestone in the agenda at national, inter-municipal, regional, municipal and local levels.
Water and sanitation companies have been involved in the Integrated Water Resources Management process, namely through sharing, consultation, information provision, training and 
64
partnership in project implementation. As part of the water and sanitation sector's reform, knowledge have been considerably improved. The short, medium and long term financing needs are known and the country is mobilizing resources, with several funded projects being implemented. The water and sanitation area has benefited from national efforts, but also from the sensitivity and involvement of development partners. However, achieving the PLENAS and Sustainable Development Strategic Plan goals in the field of water and sanitation represent first-line challenges.  
The Sustainable Development Strategic Plan aims at ensuring the right to water and sanitation, continuing the sector's reform, improving water and sanitation 
governance, strengthening technical skills and regulation. On the other hand, the plan intends to preserve environmental quality and sustainable water resources exploitation, ensure compliance with the policies on use and coordination among the entities involved. The PEDS also calls for appropriate sanitation and environmental systems to meet modern world demands and provide a healthy and good quality environment to citizens, especially in the areas of solid urban waste management, rainwater drainage and slope protection, and wastewater treatment systems. The Agricultural Transformation Program aims to make this an income-generating sector, one that brings prosperity and social recognition, respects and protects the environment, generates fair returns, and to that end, the water resources are considered absolutely relevant and 

 VOLUNTARY NATIONAL REPORT ON THE 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2030 AGENDA FOR 
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

essential. Thus, the policy was designed to ensure universal and balanced access to potable water for all and to pursue reforms in the water and sanitation sector, with a view to environmental sustainability and quality, public health, improved socio-economic conditions and the well-being of citizens.  
According to the Third National Communication on Climate Change, in Cabo Verde, water is one of the resources through which people will recognize the effects of climate change, considering the probable changes in precipitation models and the consequent availability of water. In the country there is a marked seasonality with dry and rainy seasons, so that at the end of the dry period one can observe underground and surface flows well below the average and even absence of water in some sources. Groundwater is among the most important 
natural resources. The increasing use of groundwater, the reduction in quantity, the salinization and contamination of coastal aquifers have become some of the most worrying problems in the management of groundwater resources, since they are considered strategic reservoirs. Climate change is taking place at an accelerating pace, resulting in increasing social, environmental, economic and political vulnerability.
Uncertainty and risk continue to persist as predonimant systemic variables that condition decision-making processes and make sustainable water resources management the focus of entities. Cabo Verde, in general, has a reduced water supply distributed heterogeneously in the country, and it has different origins. Among freshwater sources, surface and underground water resources stand out. Other sources of water may also be 
evaluated, such as the desalination of brackish water or seawater and the reuse of wastewater in irrigation in some municipalities. The decrease in annual precipitation (-20 to -10%), combined with up to 2.5\0x221E C rise in temperature, will expose a large proportion of the rural population to food insecurity and drastically affect the economy. Dry farming has not been feasible in many areas. To adapt to these changes in the driest periods, the Third National Communication on Climate Change suggests agricultural diversification and increased use of crops more adapted to drought, water harvesting and supplemental irrigation techniques, and use of drip irrigation for more effective use of irrigation water. It also suggests that integrated water resources management be promoted in order to ensure water for: populations, food production, ecosystems and the tourist industry.





SDG 7. ENSURE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE, RELIABLE, SUSTAINABLE AND MODERN ENERGY FOR ALL
The Government of Cabo Verde elected energy security, price stability and reduction of the energy bill as central concerns, duly established in the PEDS, in line with SDGs 7, directives that will materialize through the National Program for Energy Sustainability aiming to make the transition to a secure, efficient and sustainable energy sector, reducing dependence on fossil fuels and ensuring universal access and energy security.
The country has made significant progress in the field of energy but significant challenges to be faced still persists. The access rate to electricity has reached 90.1%. In other words, only about 10 out of every 100 people are excluded, and they belong to the disadvantaged social strata and the population of remote areas of Cabo Verde. While the SDG 7 is 100% access by 2030 globally, Cabo Verde intends to reach this goal as early as 2021. However, in order to ensure actual access to electricity, in addition to physically extending the power grids, policies aimed at facilitating connection and ensuring price affordability need to be implemented, in order to make sure families do not commit too much of their income to the payment of electricity bills. The high cost of electricity constitutes a substantial burden on the expenses of vulnerable families. 
The Government of Cabo Verde has approved the legal framework for the social energy tariff as a measure to protect economically vulnerable electricity consumers. The tariff comes into force before the end of this year.  Cabo Verde still needs to meet the challenge of efficiency. That is, while the level of effectiveness of the power grid expansion strategy is satisfactory, there is still a need to build resilience and sustainability conditions in the sector, namely by combating the high level of non-technical losses and improving the operational efficiency of energy production, transportation and distribution. 
Regarding primary access to clean fuels and technologies, it evolved from 71% in 2015 to 73.5% in 2016. Cabo Verde is a country with lack rainfall, presenting a very reduced forest coverage. In many rural and peri-urban areas, firewood is still the primary energy source in food preparation, despite the limited potential for wood energy.
The demand for firewood to meet families' energy needs puts great pressure on the country's fragile vegetation coverage, with serious consequences for the environment such as desertification, soil degradation, reduction of rainwater retention capacity, degradation of the quality of life and health of the population. The use of these fuels diminishes opportunities for carrying out income generating activities, because women spend a considerable part of their available time looking for firewood and preparing food in inefficient stoves. 
The Household Energy Strategy includes two areas of intervention: the design and implementation of a program for the dissemination of enhanced stoves and the promotion of the use of locally manufactured stoves at affordable prices. This indicator (primary access to clean fuels and technologies) by acting in the three aspects of Sustainability, the Economic, Social and Environmental sustainability having interconnections with other Sustainable Development Goals, namely, SDGs 1, 3, 5 and 15.
The production of renewable energy has made significant progress, reaching a penetration rate of 16.9% in 2017, mainly explained by the increase in total production, with the relatively stable permanence of renewable production.
The use of the great potential of endogenous renewable resources, notably, the wind and solar component, is acknowledged as being strategic for reducing the electricity and water cost, increasing energy security and competitiveness as well as national economy diversity. 
The development of a local market for renewable energies has a great potential to induce, directly and indirectly, the emergence of new companies and industries and services engaged in the construction, marketing, installation and maintenance aspects of renewable technologies, with a positive impact on the creation of new jobs and on the sustainable growth of the national economy.  
Large-scale investment in energy production from renewable sources also requires modernizing the transportation and distribution system, so as to allow the system to coexist with high levels of penetration from intermittent renewable sources.  
On the other hand, resilience to climate changes, droughts and consequent water scarcity suggest the need for a low-cost desalination investment to strengthen water mobilization, not only for human supply, but also for other productive activities, namely high value added agriculture, with the exploitation of endogenous renewable resources being the catalyst for this change.  
The energy efficiency measured in terms of energy intensity indicate, as provisional results of the energy sector, that it rose from  1.41 tep/millions of shields in 2015 to 1.52 tep/million of escudos in 2016. 
Cabo Verde is implementing its strategy for energy efficiency focusing on promoting energy efficiency in buildings, promoting energy efficiency in appliances 
 VOLUNTARY NATIONAL REPORT ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

and equipment, and promoting energy efficiency for intensive consumers. 
The goal is to boost the energy performance of buildings which requires Government Leadership by setting the Example and Commitment of entrepreneurs and immovable owners to change the logic of public and private investments to deliver more efficient buildings that can help improve quality of life.

SDG 8. PROMOTE SUSTAINED, INCLUSIVE AND SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH, FULL AND PRODUCTIVE EMPLOYMENT AND DECENT WORK FOR ALL
Access to employment is one of the pillars for promoting decent work, which means, first of all, employment opportunities for those who are available and seeking employment. This implies decent jobs for the well-being of workers and individuals in general. The indicators below allow to analyze employment opportunities in Cabo Verde, measured in terms of employment and unemployment.
The annual rate of change in real GDP per employed person declined by 5.2% in 2015, 3.7% in 2016, but reversed the trend in 2017, when it grew by 6.9%, thanks to the 3.9% economic growth, in the context of a reduction in the employed population, which is why it was an atypical year.   In 2015, the majority (58.8%) of informal non-agricultural jobs was done by women and this is the latest available data on informal economic activity.
 
In Cabo Verde, men spend more time on paid work than women. In 2017, workers worked an average of 44 hours a week, 45 hours for men and 42 hours for women, and average working time has stabilized in recent years.  Women aged 15-24 work an average of 43 hours per week and men aged 65 and over work an average of 47 hours per week, with the maximums among women and men occuring in these groups.  In Cabo Verde, the unemployment rate reached 12.2% in 2017, a reduction of 3.2 percentage points from 2016. The behavior of the labor market in the last two years is atypical, with increases in employment and in the unemployment rate in 2016, and a decline in employment and in the unemployment rate in 2017.
In 2016, because of the elections and the high expectations created, job search was high, while in 2017, there was a severe drought, which drastically reduced the volume of agriculture, the main source of employment, especially in rural areas.  Thus, in 2017 trade took agricultureis place as the main generator of employment. 
Unemployment continues to affect women more severely than men. Among active women, 12.8% were unemployed, against 11.8% for active men. Unemployment remains high among young people.  Young non-employed people who are not in school or training are one of the focal points of the sustainable development agenda and also of the Cabo Verdean authorities. In the last two years, the proportion of young people in this situation decreased significantly, from 32.3 in 2016 to 31.4% in 2017. 
Overall, women are at a disadvantage in the labor market, and it is not so strange that the proportion of young unemployed women not in school or training (33.0%) is higher than that of young men in the same situation (29.2%). The situation remained stable for young men, but improved for young women, with a 1.8 percentage point drop. The financial system provides 2 commercial banks per 100,000 adults and about 50.5 ATMs per 100,000 adults. With regard to commitment and disbursements under the AfT initiative, there was a sharp drop between 2013 and 2016, while reaching 33.3% in 2017, which represents a significant recovery. 
In Cabo Verde most of the poor have jobs, although the unemployment level remains high and only 45% of workers have social security. 
Resilience is one of the virtues of the informal sector in Cabo Verde, so creating an environment conducive to the formalization of informal production units can boost business and economic activity. With the support of partners such as the ILO, the Government of Cabo Verde has adopted a program to transition from the informal to the formal economy, as well as a set of measures concerning the financing of companies and businesses. Tax incentives and other measures to improve the business environment were adopted. The growth of small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as of the insured population, in the last two years bear witness to the growth in formalization; that is, also the growth in trust, as confirmed by economic data.
At legislative and institutional level, Cabo Verde has long been committed to the fight against all forms of discrimination in the workplace by ratifying the ILO conventions in this area (Fundamental Conventions 100 and 111). In order to protect workers' rights, especially against the termination of the employment contract, the Cabo Verdean Labor Code lays down the necessary provisions for this purpose.  Despite this instrument, in practice, the percentage of unprotected workers remains significant, 

 VOLUNTARY NATIONAL REPORT ON THE 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2030 AGENDA FOR 
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

given the informality of employment, both the informal and formal sector. The right to social security is registered in the Constitution of the Republic of Cabo Verde and the rights are also included in the Cabo Verdean Labor Code, and are consistent with ILO Convention 102 on the matter. 
The successive governments of Cabo Verde have included the phenomenon of child labor in their programs, and they consider them as concerns to be eradicated. As evidence of the ownership of these aspects, Cabo Verde ratified the two fundamental ILO conventions on child labor, namely Convention 138 on the Minimum Age of Work Admission, 
1973 and Convention No 182 on the worst forms of child labor, 1999. On these aspects, the Constitution of the Republic of Cabo Verde and the Labor Code are also guaranting the defense of these fundamental rights of the child.
The acceleration of economic growth with the generation of formal employment, transition from the informal economy and expansion of social security coverage, and salary adjustments provided for in the strategic dialogue agreement, in the context of actual regulation of the labor market, will favor the growth of decent employment.

SDG 9. BUILD RESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE, PROMOTE INCLUSIVE 
AND SUSTAINABLE INDUSTRIALIZATION AND FOSTER INNOVATION
Cabo Verde is mainly a service economy and the weight of the manufacturing industry is not very significant. In 2017, it accounted for only 7.8% of GDP, although its weight has been increasing, since it was only 2.4% in 2015. It overs only about 9.3% of men's employment and 9.8% of womenis, with a GVA/per capita of around 225 euros.   Light export industry is the best bet and requires improvements through investments and measures in the infrastructure, transportation, energy, telecommunications, education and research, from vocational training to research and new information technologies, including bureaucracy reduction. 
To this end, the Government plans to adopt a new industrial development strategy for growth and employment which will boost national industry, reinforcing its competitiveness and increasing the weight of the manufacturing industry in the national economy. To this end, among other policy measures, Cabo Verde's competitiveness in attracting investment will be strengthened, namely by amending the tax benefit code, establishing a swift and credible judicial system and creating a mechanism that will stimulate the entry of international venture capital, the AGOA programs and export facilities to Canada will be taken advantage of, and Cabo Verde will be promoted as a platform for exports to the ECOWAS and other destinations in Africa. Technological facilities will be developed to promote the attraction and installation of companies of the sector that can qualify the light industry sector in the entire country, through excellence. 
The importance of road infrastructure is increasingly relevant in economic development, as good roads reduce transportation costs and the final price of products, making them more accessible to consumers and more competitive with competitors. They also allow each region to specialize in the economic activities for which they have the greatest potential, generating gains in terms of productivity and quality for the whole economy. 

 VOLUNTARY NATIONAL REPORT ON THE 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2030 AGENDA FOR 
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

Road investments also have a major impact on reducing poverty and improving peopleis quality of life.  Today, national and municipal roads total 1,650 km, with 1,113 km corresponding to national roads and 537 km to municipal roads. A significant proportion of the national road network has been subject to a comprehensive rehabilitation and modernization program over the past 15 years, with more than 700 km of roads being built, rehabilitated and modernized. 
In Cabo Verde, one of the priorities for the road transportation and infrastructure sector is the development of infrastructure and means of transportation in order to ensure safety, efficiency and quality in the movement of people 
and goods, and access to places with economic potential.  The development of an integrated, safe road network that ensures good road service, as well as safety and comfort in the movement of people and goods, is a relevant aspect that can lead to reduced distances from each municipality, reduced pressure to concentrate in cities, and improved distribution of productive activities, public services and income among various areas, thus contributing to national wealth, the balance of payments, employment and national mobility. 
Preserving, exploiting and planning the national road networkis development, protecting the road infrastructure and its functionality, road maintenance, a road 
infrastructure policy that is integrated into land-use planning and economic development, linking the road network with other modes of transportation, developing knowledge and studies that contribute to the technological and economic progress of the road sector, and continuing to improve access to remote areas are priorities for the 2017-2021 period adopted in the Strategic Sustainable Development Plan. It is in this context that the Government rolled out the Requalification, Rehabilitation and Accessibility Plan (PRRA), oh which one of the priority axes is the improvement of accessibilities among locations. 
The sea and air cargo and passenger transportation systems are expected to 

76
ensure national market unification and its integration with the international market, supported mainly by the creation of the maritime and air platforms. A thorough restructuring of the sector that includes strengthening institutional organization and strong private sector participation, creating public service obligations in air and sea transportation, as well as in urban and interurban road transportation, prioritizing a public transportation service concession system, requiring the establishment of regular, efficient and affordable routes between islands, the privatization of port and 
airport services, and the modernization of ship repair services.
Investment in renewable energies should be a decisive goal, aiming to reduce dependence on fossil fuels, and thus external dependence, and perhaps the price of energy as a structuring factor for the costs of various inputs.   The implementation of this strategy in-
cludes creating a logistics port to supply international ships passing through or approaching Cabo Verde on their routes, including ships circulating in West Africa and transshipment (Maritime Platform) 
(1), creating a logistics airport for the international distribution of passengers and freight, linking the continents and countries bordering the Atlantic (Air Platform), locating companies, and turning Cabo Verde into an International Business Center and a center for attracting 
FDI and for promoting Endogenous Business Initiatives (Commercial and Industrial Platform), and developing the Digital and Nano-technological Economy (Digital and Innovation Platform).
Making Cabo Verde a digital and innovation platform is an essential aspect 
78

 VOLUNTARY NATIONAL REPORT ON THE 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2030 AGENDA FOR 
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

of Cabo Verde's dynamic insertion into the world economic system, aiming to make Cabo Verde not just a consumer of digital economy products, but also a researcher, investor, producer and distributor.  Achieving this goal requires a bold and firm strategy, with a focus on innovation and insertion into global research and digital technology production centers and networks, with the State taking on the creation of conditions in basic support sectors, such as telecommunication. 
This conclusion/statement allows to infer that, although digital platform 
development is the work of the private sector and institutions, the State is the main leader and the main promoter. And the main partner. Taking on this role (of promoter and partner) is an indispensable condition for success. The Stateis role is essential especially in articulating private initiatives, creating incentives, promoting alliances, external partnerships and training. In other words, it is incumbent upon the State to take on the co-leadership of this platformis development, alongside private initiatives, stimulate and lead the creation of a strategy, promote a digital culture and insert Cabo Verde into the global 
ICT network (companies, namely hardware companies, research and content production and distribution centers, innovation and development spaces) and, associated with the idea of Cabo Verde CIN, create incentives for developing the digital and innovation platform. Being an intensive, highly qualified and specialized human capital field, the success of the platform depends, in particular, on the quality and scope of the reform of the human resources qualification system, particularly education system reform.





SDG 10. REDUCE INEQUALITY WITHIN AND AMONG COUNTRIES
Thanks mainly to investments in education, health and other basic services, but also to social protection policies, relating to the increase in employment and especially more skilled people, in the last 15 years, inequality in consumption expenditures has been reduced in a sensitive way as the suggested by the Lorenz Curves and the GINI Index that went from 0.53 in 2001 to 0.42 in 2015.
The inequalities are less pronounced in the rural area (GINI Index, 0.38 in 2015) than in the urban area (GINI Index of 0.41).  S\0x201Eo Vicente is the island with the highest decrease of inequalities with the Gini Index reduced 12.9 tenths, reaching 
0.40 in 2015, and at the other end is the island of Fogo with the lowest decrease from 0.43 in 2001 to 0.40 in 2015.  Tarrafal de S\0x201Eo Nicolau is the municipality with the highest level of inequality (0.46) and at the other extreme is the Municipality S\0x201Eo Salvador do Mundo 0.32, and they are both municipalities of small population and belonging to the group of the last municipalities established in Cabo Verde.  
The analysis of expenditure by quintiles shows that despite our 42 years of independence and 26 years of municipalism, but also to the compact of social policies and investments, with special emphasis on education that has caused effective social mobility upwards of thousands of poor, we continue to have deep inequalities. The people of the first quintile who, by the way, are all poor, have an average annual expenditure of $509.1, while those of the 5th quintile, that is, the richest 20% of Cabo Verde, have an average annual consumption of $4,383.3, that is, 8.6 times higher than the people in the first quintile. 
By addressing income from consumption expenditure, the richest 40%, has 70% of income. It confirms that inequalities are more pronounced in urban than rural areas; the fact that, in the former, 20% of the wealthiest families, ie the fifth quintile, concentrate in urban areas around 57% of income, while that in rural areas consumption expenditure is more evenly distributed according to the expenditure quintiles, ie the richest 20% account for 22% of the total expenditure incurred. In Cabo Verde, wages represent about 43% of the Gross Value Added of the economy as a whole and 37% of the Gross Domestic Product, which suggests that there is fiscal space to improve the level of wages, but also the distribution of income necessary for the reduction of poverty.   
In Cabo Verde, the average consumption is about 1.74 times the poverty line in urban areas and 2 times in rural areas, so poverty is mainly a problem of distribution, of equity, in other words, it is due to the high level of inequalities. About 61% of the poor are women and 4 out of 100 are immigrants. The level of poverty is dependent on training and, in particular, on the volume and quality of employment, as a service economy.  
Housing deficits and insecurity constitute an important dimension of poverty in terms of access to basic social services, especially for those in need of care as children of poor, elderly and disabled families, compounded by the weakening of traditional forms of social protection.  Unpaid work represents close to 70% of the total workload in the country, meaning that the social effort and social contribution of families to social well-being and social cohesion is very high and falls mainly on women, but more than half of children and adolescents stay long periods of the day without adult supervision. 
Cabo Verde became, in the last two decades, a destination of immigration, thus increasing the foreign population and immigrants, posing challenges of flow management, as well as integration of immigrants in Cabo Verde, namely, 

 VOLUNTARY NATIONAL REPORT ON THE 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2030 AGENDA FOR 
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

regularization, labor market regulation, protection and social inclusion domains. Social inequalities also translate into gender inequalities, opportunities especially for the disabled and decent work, with special emphasis on women. 
In order to reduce poverty in Cabo Verde, economic growth of at least 5% per annum is needed, which also results in a substantial generation of employment capable of reducing inequalities, in the context of low inflation, which means less than 5%, accompanied by active social transfer policies with proper focus. 
The large majority (65%) of Cabo Verdeans are not poor, but among them an important part has low incomes and thus is unable to access opportunities 
such as vocational training or higher, certain health care, decent food and housing. 
It is in this context that government interventions in the field of social inclusion are accompanied by policies to promote family development and social inclusion, the fight against poverty, the promotion of equal rights and opportunities and the full participation and integration of people with disabilities , of policies that promote decent job creation that provide access to basic social goods such as health, education, water, energy, housing, food and vocational training; protection and social inclusion of children and adolescents at risk of 

82
social exclusion of gender equality and policies relevant to the management of immigration and integration of immigrants. 
This compact also includes the income access program that includes Social Inclusion Income and Social Pension. These measures that materialize commitments made in the Government Program and in the Sustainable Development Strategic Plan (PEDS) genuinely meet the SDGs

The Social Inclusion Income (SII) is a direct monetary transfer to people and is aimed for individuals and households with children under 15 years living in extreme poverty. The Social Pension is intended for people aged 60 years or more from poor families, i.e. with annual income below the poverty threshold. 
The Access to Education program consists of ensuring access to education services for people living in poverty and social vulnerability, especially children and adolescents, whose families do not 
have the means to support education costs.  The Access to Health program consists of ensuring access to the health service and compensation mechanisms for persons with disabilities and the chronically ill, as well as access to health care and medical and medical care for people who are sick and are not covered social security systems in the country.
 
The Promotion of Inclusion of People with Special Needs program is translated into the creation of conditions for the empowerment and/or strengthening of

the capacities of organizations that intervene in the prevention, rehabilitation and integration of people with special needs. 
The implementation of the dependent care system (children from 0 to 3 years old, elderly people and people with disabilities) is one of the priorities of the Government of Cabo Verde. Institutional and legal conditions have already been created for the effective implementation of the National Plan for Care.  The 
inclusion programs include the municipalization of the Social Inclusion sector with the municipalization of the Social Development Centers, ensuring greater proximity and eliminating duplication of interventions and contributing to an integrated management of the social inclusion sector.  
The Institutional Strengthening of Civil Society Organizations will result in a Social Security Network at the level of all the municipalities of the Country and 
includes the granting of funding from social welfare associations. In the context of social inclusion, programs to promote the social integration of immigrants are also being developed to promote the rights and protection of children and adolescents, to promote the rights and protection of children and adolescents, particularly those at risk personal and social, promoting Equity and Gender Equality.





SDG 11. MAKE CITIES AND HUMAN 
SETTLEMENTS INCLUSIVE, SAFE, RESILIENT AND SUSTAINABLE
The Sustainable Development Strategic Plan assumes the creation of a new study on the housing situation, with a reassessment of the basic and extended housing deficit as well as the definition of a new national housing policy.  In Cabo Verde, only 1.4% of households live in non-traditional housing, which includes shanties, and the vast majority (98.6%) live in independent housing or apartments. The vast majority of households have electricity, piped water and sanitation facilities, and at least 2 out of 3 households occupy housing that they own, with the largest numbers among the poor, as 72 out of every 100 poor households occupy homes that they own, compared to 63% of non-poor households.   
The essential problem of housing in Cabo Verde has to do with housing insecurity, that is to say with the degradation of housing, especially in rural areas.  At the national level, 49 out of every 100 households live in homes with roof infiltration problems and 52 out of every 100 have infiltration and moisture problems in their walls. This situation of insecurity is particularly serious among the poor, as 64 out of every 100 people live in houses with roof infiltration problems and 65 out of every 100 dwellings have problems with infiltration and moisture in the walls.  Normally, the costs of requalification exceed the possibilities of poor households.  
However, in addition to the precarious monetary conditions, the poor are still affected by lack of access to basic services such as electricity, piped water and sanitation. About 20% of poor households and 30% of the population living in extreme poverty lack access to electricity, particularly those living in rural areas. Just over half (53.2%) of the poor households have access to piped water, but only 50.8% obtain water primarily from the public network. Just over half (55.2%) of the poor households and about 40.4% of the extreme poor have access to sanitation, that is, they have a toilet, connected in large measure to septic tanks (41.4%), being that only 13.1% of poor households have access to the public sewage system. 
Cabo Verde is served by a good network of national and municipal roads, but also to automobiles in good condition so that the majority of the population has safe and easy access to transportation. Most of the Cities are small in size and so internal mobility does not depend on the availability of public transportation, which is high quality, reliable, safe and comfortable in the two largest cities, 
 VOLUNTARY NATIONAL REPORT ON THE 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2030 AGENDA FOR 
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
Praia and Mindelo. Inter-urban transport is served by mini-buses and in lesser amounts by mixed-use vehicles, espe-
cially for areas not served by cobble-stoned or asphalted roads.  
However, no Cabo Verdean city has mobility systems adapted for people with disabilities, so architectural barriers seriously limit accessibility. All 24 cities in Cabo Verde have urban plans and hence urban management is an important function, taking into account that almost two out of three Cabo Verdeans now live in urban areas.  Shanty towns have been a reality for decades on the islands of S\0x201Eo Vicente and Boa Vista, where a significant part of the population live in spontaneous genesis and expansion neighborhoods, which are not served by public services.  
However, the major problem has to do with the lack of urban infrastructure, that is, the main cities grew primarily by clandestine occupation or in a planned way but without previous infrastructure, meaning without sewers and most of the streets are unpaved and therefore not accessible in the rainy season, with a lack drainage systems and water. Most of the neighborhoods are lacking in terms of public spaces such as squares, parks, urban furniture and in many cases, spaces and equipment for sports.    
Urban requalification is therefore one of the pressing needs and should be an area of concentration of public attention that requires international partnership. Cabo Verde is a country where the urbanization process, especially by African standards, is well advanced, with 

88

about 68% of the population currently living in the cities. Although there is no precise diagnosis of the total number of families and dwellings in the informal settlements of Cabo Verde, it is possible to conclude that this phenomenon is present in a large part of the cities of the country, especially those that show more dynamism in terms of urbanization and population growth. 
As a consequence, the cities of Cabo Verde have informal settlements, which includes subdivisions, irregular construction and other settlements marked by some form of administrative and patrimonial irregularities. In these terms, the political and management challenge facing Cabo Verde is the search for alternatives capable of stopping and preventing the formation of new precarious urban settlements, through preventative policies in favor of the poorest populations, along with measures that offer solutions for housing and formal urban development.

The urban profiles of all cities in Cabo Verde have already been elaborated in the national urban profile, within the framework of the Participatory Slum Upgrading Programme (PSUP) financed by the European Commission and implemented by UN-HABITAT. A participatory planning methodology and a plan of action to improve informal settlements have also been defined. Informal settlement processes in urban areas have been growing in areas exposed to natural hazards (streams, steep slopes) and areas less controlled by the municipal administration. As a result, the informal area of risk increased significantly from 8 per cent in 1990 to 22 per cent in 2000 and surpassed 40 per cent in 2015.
A new National Program for the Improvement of Informal Settlements is expected for the period 2018-2022, with 7 main axes of intervention, namely, disaster risk reduction and environment, urban mobility, basic services, rehabilitation and resettlement, local urban governance, local economic development, urban citizenship and capacity building.
Cabo Verde adopted its National Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction covers the period 2017-2030, in line with the time horizon of the Sendai Framework for 

 VOLUNTARY NATIONAL REPORT ON THE 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2030 AGENDA FOR 
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 and the Africa and ECOWAS Action Plans for Reducing Disaster Risk, and covers all types of risks, and aims to increase resilience by promoting priority measures to prevent disaster risks and improve risk management, reducing the exposure and vulnerability of society and all its subsystems, including human settlements, critical infrastructures, basic services and equipment, historical heritage, ecosystems and environment, livelihoods, assets, people and their health.  
In Cabo Verde, coverage of solid waste collection services varies with the size of municipalities and in particular the importance of the rural area. In addition, about 79 out of every 100 households 
remove solid waste in containers or garbage vehicles, with greater expression in the urban environment where almost all (97%) of the households benefit from this collection, leading solid waste to its destination, while in rural areas, most of the household dump waste in nature or send it to another improper destination.
This situation is exacerbated by the fact that around 28% of the solid waste is non-biodegradable, ie glass bottles, plastics, or cans, in addition to slow-decomposing paper, especially given our hot and dry climate.  As a result, solid waste is increasingly an environmental problem, this being in the absence of reuse systems such as recycling, separation and export or incineration for energy production. Sanitation is Cabo Verde's 
weakest development link and one of the essential problems of urban environment.
The Government has developed and is implementing a National Policy on Land Use Planning and Urban Development, in the light of the New Urban Agenda (20162036), with a view to harmonizing the framework of existing sectoral policies and strategies related to urban issues, including social, environmental and economic dimensions. The Government of Cabo Verde also has ongoing development of the National Housing Policy which will have a validity of 20 years, in line with the New Urban Agenda.

SDG 12. ENSURE SUSTAINABLE CONSUMPTION AND PRODUCTION PATTERNS 
Cabo Verde has not yet adopted a Sustainable Consumption and Production Action Plan, although sustainability is one of the pillars of our survival, taking into account the country's economic, social, environmental, climate and energy vulnerabilities.  As a country, which imports at least 80% of food products, food losses must be reduced. 
According to the Strategic National Plan for Solid Waste Prevention and Management (PENGER), in Cabo Verde the production of hazardous waste has low expression, as this represent only 0.5% of waste, equivalent to 853 tons / year. However, at least in health facilities there are routines for handling this type of waste.  The Plan foresees the reduction, by 2030, by 
50% of the amount of hazardous waste deposited.  It also plans to reduce the degree of danger from hazardous solid waste by structuring specific streams of hazardous waste, such as hospital waste, waste oils, batteries and accumulators, through the management of these flows. Further provided for are the identification of disposal sites containing asbestos waste, and to ensure the eradication of waste containing asbestos. 
The Plan aims to promote a balanced evolution of the amount of waste produced per inhabitant, that is, to reduce by 10% of the capitation value per GDP by 2030, as well as the adoption of strategies to reduce plastic waste in Cabo Verde with a view to reduction of the proportion of fine plastics admitted to the management systems by 80% by 2030 and the law on prohibition of import and use of non-biodegradable plastic bags is already in force. It also provides for the recovery of solid waste specifically, by selective collection in at least 60% of municipalities by 2030, increasing by 2025 to 50% of the waste sent for recovery and the creation of 8 units for the recovery of organic waste by 2030.   By 2030, 60% of waste paper, glass, plastic and metal for recycling / recovery will be processed. The Plan also presupposes the recovery and recycling of construction and demolition waste. To do so, 50% of inert waste should be processed by 2030 for reuse in new buildings or recovery of extraction areas. 20% of construction and demolition waste for recycling is to be processed by 2030. 
With regard to the sustainable production and consumption target, for the subsidy of fossil fuels, Cabo Verde has stopped subsidizing fossil fuels since 2009. Currently, the fossil fuel prices charged in the domestic market are regulated by a maximum price system, with monthly updates through a mechanism that automatically indexes prices to the fluctuation of international prices. These prices are also subject to a number of tax burdens, such as excise duty and VAT. The value of the fuel import energy bill has risen from 1.8% (2016) to 2.3% (2017) of total imports represented 7,5 and 10.2% of GDP at current prices in those years. These figures may have a greater or lesser significance according to the price fluctuation in the international market, making the country vulnerable to the oscillations and volatility of the international situation. Cabo Verde's strategy involves increasing the sector's resilience to external shocks by reducing energy dependence on imported fossil fuels, focusing on large-scale exploitation of the renewable energy potential in the country and introducing stimuli and incentives to efficiency on both the supply side and the demand side, including the promotion of electrical mobility. 
In Cabo Verde, sustainable public procurement is a practice, albeit in the process of improvement. The Public Procurement Code approved by Law n\0x222B 88 / VIII / 2015 of April 14 establishes that in procurement procedures, public and private entities involved should, whenever applicable, give priority to those acquisitions, works, solutions and ecological actions understood to contribute most significantly to the reduction of negative environmental impacts.
The Public Procurement Code (CCP), which regulates the formation of contracts and the Legal Regime of Administrative Contracts, which regulates the execution of contracts, promotes sustainable public procurement through the principles of Public Procurement, standards and procedures. In addition to environmental issues, sustainable public procurement implies social, financial and economic sustainability, mirrored in national legislation and adequately adapted to the country's reality.
In Cabo Verde, education for good citizenship is already part of the curricula. Specific education for sustainable development is not yet included, but the Strategic Education Plan ensures alignment with the SDGs and even the organizational structure of the Ministry of Education ensures the crosscutting of SDGs, so that sustainable development permeates the education system.
In alignment with United Nations guidelines, the Government of Cabo Verde is drafting the Great Options of the Sustainable Development Strategic Plan for Tourism -  GOPEDS-Tourism bearing in mind that sustainable development of tourism is based on five pillars, namely economic, social, environmental, cultural and peace, security and respect for the peoples. Round tables were held on sun and beach tourism, rural and nature tourism, urban, cultural and nautical tourism, regional tourism, tourism from the countryside of Santiago, meetings at the level of all the municipalities in the country, addressing the topic of local tourism development. A high-level meeting on the tourism development on the island of Maio has highlighted the importance of a balanced and sustained tourism development in the country, the need to address tourism on this island in a way that ensures a paradigm differentiation of the model in the neighboring islands, form a quantity tourism to a higher quality tourism, with a strong environmental, social and cultural trademark. It is intended that Maio and the other islands of the country add to the sun and beach product, so precious to those who visit us, transition elements for a more diversified, ecological and population inclusive supple, which may be a pilot for the next tourist development of the other islands in the country.  In this sense, the Government of Cabo Verde will proceed with the development of Tourism Master Plan by islands, starting with the island of Maio.

SDG 14. CONSERVE AND SUSTAINABLY USE THE OCEANS, SEAS AND 
MARINE RESOURCES FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 
Our Sea is clearly our greatest wealth and one of the essential elements of our identity. Our Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), a range of exploration and management responsibility for living and non-living resources, situated 200 nautical miles from the coast, currently totaling 740,000 km\0x2264, can reach 1Million Km\0x2264 with the extension of the respective continental shelf up to 350 nautical miles), reveals an immense heritage, which we can not neglect. 
The dispersion of the islands allows Cabo Verde to benefit from processes of differentiation of species which are now translated by rich biodiversity and an important number of endemic species. Marine ecosystems and fishing activities are for this island country resources and a strategic sector for employment, food security and the fight against poverty. For a long time based on the technical regulation of capacities and the number of fishermen, approaches have evolved into an integrated and ecosystem region taking into account the conditions of existence and vulnerability of communities according to sustainable territorial development. 
In addition to the Millennium Goals (almost fully achieved) and Sustainable Development Goals, the country and coastal territories must integrate the challenges of adaptation to climate changes. Cabo Verde is very vulnerable to climate change in particular in relation to (i) rainfall and drought, very damaging to agriculture and access to water, (ii) the evolution of fish catches and (iii) the rise in sea level that reinforces coastal risks of erosion and marine submersion in a country where 80% of the population resides on the coast. Until 2050, according to Lam et al. (2012), the changes in distribution and composition of marine species, particularly important in the tropical area, will have effects on the country's food safety. Simulations carried out by these authors calculate the reduction of catches in Cabo Verde EEZ by 6% or 22%, according to the emission scenarios (i.e. slightly below the average of West Africa that is 8% and 26%). This decrease will mainly cause effects on prices, export earnings and income from fisheries agreements due to a lower attractiveness of the EEZ. 
In view of these challenges, we need to work towards strengthening the re-

The Blue Economy, as a crosscutting and evolving economic development model, designates the wealth potential contained in the oceans, once well managed, generate employment and business opportunities, assuring the preservation of the oceans, supported by the intelligent use and full use of natural resources, ensuring marine biodiversity and ecosystems functioning sustainably. 
This stage development in which country navigates, obviously regenerates activities related to the sea and the oceans,

Cabo Verde's commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals 14, reveals a strong recognition that the ocean is 
essential for our shared future, connecting the populations and markets, representing an important part of our natural and cultural heritage. Aware of actions to comply with Goal 14, the Government of Cabo Verde through the Ministry of Maritime Economy has already under way the National Investment Plan for Blue Economy.
We are aware that the ocean patents the heart of the world, supplying almost half of the oxygen the humans need to breathe, absorbing more than a quarter of the carbon dioxide we produce, playing a vital role in the water cycle and climate system, and an important source of biodiversity. In this framework, in accordance with the set of actions,

Fortunately, we cohabit in relative harmony with our ecosystem, not presenting problems and constraints related to marine and maritime pollution, nor acidification and environmental erosion, contamination of industrial waste directed to the seas and the oceans, given the inexistence of large industries and smallness of our economy. 
However, planning and planning of maritime and coastal space, organization of the development of industries, policies aimed at conservation and preservation of the seas and marine resources, structuring of cities, growth strategies must be designed in concert with sustainable environmental, economic and social development. Social. We are aware that our development is to revitalize activities linked to the sea and the oceans, but we recognize that the country still faces numerous challenges, need of investments in knowledge, acquire expertise and skills in marine resources, marine and maritime research, need in infrastructure, equipment fit to the new challenges, but mainly adoption of an organized management models, to develop this key sector for the country.

It is worth mentioning that Cabo Verde is a country that since the very beginning has been ready to align with the international legal instruments that guide the preservation of the environment on a global scale. Therefore, Cabo Verde acceded in October 1994 to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) and was the first African country and the second in the world to ratify the Convention and in February 1995, and the Program of Action to Combat Desertification desertification in line with the Ten Year Strategy of the Convention to Combat Desertification. -UNCCD. Cabo Verde's efforts since independence to combat desertification are striking and tangible, with the exponential increase in forested areas and erosion control measures and land preservation.  
 

 VOLUNTARY NATIONAL REPORT ON THE 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2030 AGENDA FOR 
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

The absence of a Biodiversity Observatory and a solid statistical information base that enables effective monitoring and monitoring of indicators makes it difficult to present the real state of biodiversity in the country. However, in spite of these shortcomings, surveys with national partners reveal that islands where Protected Areas are already in place, biodiversity is in better conservation. It is noted that the country has a Red List drawn up in the second five-years of the 90s. Given the dynamics of ecosystems, the need to update this document is recognized, and the institutional initiatives already in progress should be recorded in order to give the country an updated Red List. 
The country does not currently assess the indicator corresponding to Goal 15.5, 
given the institutional weaknesses still prevailing in terms of the production of statistics and information relevant to that effect. It is noted that endemic species were reintroduced in the natural parks of Serra Malagueta on Santiago Island, Monte Gordo, Ilha de S\0x201Eo Nicolau and Ch\0x201E das Caldeiras on Fogo Island, Cova Natural Park/Paul/Ribeira da Torre and Natural Park of Moro\0xC1os on the island of Santo Anton and Monte Verde Natural Park on the island of S\0x201Eo Vicente, making a decisive contribution to the replacement of a vegetation cover, previously deforested. 
Another important measure has been the removal of invasive plants, thus allowing the control of natural agreement between invasive and endemic plants. In the remaining islands and places where 
they are not yet functional, it is worth highlighting actions developed by research institutions, namely the National Institute of Agrarian Development and Non-Governmental Organizations, and it is also worth highlighting the involvement of university students who have contributed to some reversal of trends and change of category in the degree of threat of one or more another species.
Erosion and runoff have contributed to significant annual losses of arable land, leading to loss of soil fertility and endangering agricultural sustainability and food security. In order to combat degradation and to guarantee agricultural production, successive governments implemented in Brazil a vast program of soil and water conservation with the construction of mechanical and bio-

logical structures for soil conservation and water harvesting). Some examples include landfills, vegetable hedges, large dams for water retention of surface water, catch dams, terraces, among others. Despite the positive impacts of the country's efforts to combat desertification and land degradation, land degradation and loss of soil quality prevail throughout the country, occurring in different forms and proportions.  Degraded soils, with low organic matter content and, consequently, organic carbon, need to be restored and/ or rehabilitated through sustainable management so that they can contribute to the mitigation of climate change. 
It is worth noting that some protected areas such as the Serra da Malagueta, Monte Gordo, as Ch\0x201E das Caldeiras, 
Cova/Paul/Ribeira da Torre, Moro\0xC1os and Monte Verde are located in mountain areas. The National Report on the State of Biodiversity, 2015, the National Directorate of Environment mentions that dry farming continues to be an economic activity that competes with native vegetation, and its action in mountain ecosystems such as Monte Verde (S\0x201Eo Vicente), Santo Ant\0x201Eo, Santiago and Fogo. The Third National Communication on Climate Change recognizes that mountain ecosystems are among the most sensitive and vulnerable to climate change and recommend that measures be taken to manage and conserve the most sensitive and vulnerable ecosystems such as mountains, dune systems, wetlands and ecosystems to increase their resilience capacity of these species to climate change.
Regarding the conservation of mountain ecosystems (Meta ODS 15.4.), according to the Statistical Yearbook 2016 data, INE, the land surface of protected areas was 733,57Km2 in 2015, representing 18.19% of the entire land surface of Cabo Verde. The country currently has a total of 46 Marine Protected Areas, distributed by the islands of Boa Vista, Maio, Santa Luzia, Santiago, Santo Ant\0x201Eo, S\0x201Eo Nicolau, S\0x201Eo Vicente, Fogo and Sal, and the islets Branco, Raso and Rombo Many of these areas already have management tools, specifically management plans, eco-tourism plans, business plans and monitoring plans. Implementation of Development and Management Plans is ongoing in 26 of the 46 protected areas.

For Goal 15.3., Indicator 15.3.1., erosion and runoff have contributed to significant annual losses of arable land, causing loss of soil fertility and endangering agricultural sustainability and food security. To combat soil degradation and to ensure agricultural production, successive governments have implemented in Brazil a vast program for soil and water conservation with the construction of mechanical and biological structures for soil and water conservation, to highlight water harvesting and water harvesting). Some examples include landfills, vegetable hedges, large dams for water retention of surface water, catch dams, terraces, among others. 
Despite the positive impacts of the country's efforts to combat desertification and land degradation, land degradation and loss of soil quality prevail throughout the country, occurring in different forms and proportions.  Degraded soils, with low organic matter content and, consequently, organic carbon, should be restored and/or rehabilitated through sustainable management so that they can contribute to the mitigation of climate change,and for food security and a more comprehensive perspective of ensuring the maintenance of soil environmental functions.
One of the four commitments Cabo Verde made at the Climate Conference is to plant 20,000 hectares and eight million of trees by 2030. From its natural specificities, it is worth noting that in Cabo Verde the soils are mostly of volcanic origin, developed on a basaltic substratum, of medium to coarse texture, sloping, rich in mineral elements, but poor in organic matter (<2%) and shallow, exhibiting marked degradation symptoms. 
 VOLUNTARY NATIONAL REPORT ON THE 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
With regard to SDG target 15.9. aligned with Indicator 15.9.1. and in this particular context it should be noted that the 20 Aichi Targets refer to biodiversity conservation and are the basis of current planning related to the implementation of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).  Target 2 states that, by 2020, biodiversity values should be integrated into poverty reduction and development strategies, national and local planning processes, and appropriately integrated into national accounting, and systems documentation and communication. Cabo Verde has a remarkable track record of integrating ecosystem and biodiversity values into national and local planning, development processes and poverty reduction strategies. 
The Sustainable Development Strategic Plan 2017-2021 - PEDS, more remotely, the National Report on the State of Biodiversity, together with the National Strategy and Action Plan on Biodiversity (ENPAB), Protected Areas\0x220F the DECRP II, the many Governance Program, the Poverty Reduction Strategy, the National Action Program to Combat Desertification, the National Action Plan and Strategy on Climate Change, the National Forest Action Program, the National Action Plan for Environment (PANA II 2004-2014),the Management Plan 2004-2014, the Action 
Plan and Integrated Water Resources Management, the Strategic Plan for the Development of Tourism 2010-2013 and the Second National Strategy and Action Plan on Biodiversity for the period 20142030 are clear evidence of the integration of biodiversity values in the poverty reduction and development strategies, as well as national planning processes.

SDG 16. PROMOTE PEACEFUL AND 
INCLUSIVE SOCIETIES FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, PROVIDE 
ACCESS TO JUSTICE FOR ALL, AND BUILD EFFECTIVE, ACCOUNTABLE AND INCLUSIVE INSTITUTIONS AT ALL LEVELS
Cabo Verde's path to democracy has become a benchmark and central element in the country's credibility. The creation of the constitutional system of mitigated parliamentarism created the foundations of the Democratic Rule of Law, instituted and cultivated fundamental freedoms, allowed for structural reforms and the implementation of the privately-based market economy. 

115





It allowed the true separation of powers with the creation of an independent judiciary and effective enforcement of the law, guaranteeing respect for individual rights and legally enshrined freedoms. It consecrated a free and pluralistic social communication and provided for the arrival, the development, and the consolidation of the private press, that exists alongside the state press, and is present in the audiovisual sectors. 
It also allowed for the emergence of a local power legitimized by direct and secret voting, which is, through its excellence, an irreplaceable space for the sharing and balancing of powers, accountability of political parties, promotion of local leadership, and appreciation of the people's vote.  
The current constitutional system has also proved to be an efficient and independent electoral system that has provided, in these 26 years, several regular and periodic local, presidential, and legislative elections, in which there are alternations that have cemented the confidence of Cabo Verdeans in the instruments of democracy and reinforced the image of Cabo Verde in the world. However, the increase in abstention may indicate some exhaustion, if not crisis of growth, of the classic mechanisms of power, especially representation.
Security and justice are sectors which have been subject to particular attention from the government, and there is a tendency towards downward reversal of violence and improvement in access to justice.   

 VOLUNTARY NATIONAL REPORT ON THE 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2030 AGENDA FOR 
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

In 2017 there were 7.1 homicides per 100,000 people in Cabo Verde, a decrease from the previous year, which was 11.7 homicides per 100,000 people, which is a relatively low level. Cabo Verde is a peaceful country and there are no deaths related to conflicts. Cabo Verde is a peaceful country and there are no deaths related to conflicts. 
However, gender-based violence (GBV) is a reality and mainly affects women. In 2017, the National Police recorded 2,516 cases, which represents a decrease of 18.7% compared to the previous year in which 3,095 cases were recorded.  In that same year the National Police recorded 3,393 cases of body injury noting a decrease of 10.8% compared to the previous year, and the reverse in relation to the 3095 cases. Cases of sexual 
abuse against children with 126 cases, that is, an increase of 6.8% compared to the previous year.  The latter have high public visibility, due to their sensitivity and has deserved the special attention of the Cabo Verdean authorities, as well as civil society organizations.    
In the political positions, Cabo Verde has a President of the Republic elected for a term of five years with a limit of two terms, a parliament with 72 deputies, 22 Mayors, 116 City Councilman, 22 Presidents of Municipal Assemblies and 320 Elected Municipal Officials. The Public Administration has 196 officers, while at the level of Justice, the governing body is comprised of 1 Attorney General and Presiding District Attorneys, 46 County Presiding Judges, 1 President and 2 Judges of the Constitutional Court. At the mili-
tary level, the chiefs comprise a Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, a Commander of the National Guard, a Commander of the Coast Guard and 3 commanders of military regions. The leadership of the National Police comprises 1 National Director, 2 Deputy National Directors, 8 Regional Commanders and 34 Chiefs of Stations.
According to Transparency International, in 2016 Cabo Verde ranked 2nd in Africa and 39th in the world in terms of low perception of corruption. More recently, according to the Afrobarometer, in 2017, one in five people considered that the level of corruption had decreased, being 5 percentage points higher than the level of 2014, and the proportion of people who felt that corruption had increased a lot or a little reached 39%, which is 

114

10 percentage points less than in 2014. The number of persons who reported having paid bribes to persons for access to services in the areas of education, police services, health services, water and electricity services and in general to obtain documents did not exceed 7 in every 100.  The implementation rate of primary expenditures of the Government budget is high, as it reached about 95.1% in 2017. The implementation rate of the Government's expenditures foreseen in the State Budget have been executed, which in itself is a testament to the level of transparency, but above all of effectiveness, which can also be measured by the performance of tax revenues that allowed financing of around 79% of the budget executed.
In Cabo Verde, there is no routine for assessing the level of satisfaction of public service users.  According to Afrobarometer, in 2017 about 45% of citizens felt that they were treated with respect by the public administration and 39 in every 100 felt that they were treated with little respect. However, Doing Business found that there is indeed some dissatisfaction with the private sector in relation to the administration, with special emphasis on lack of supervision and consequent unfair competition, slowness of courts, low resolution of problems, lack of proficiency in foreign languages, the unsatisfactory functioning of customs and revenue and the costs of energy and connectivity. However, the vast majority of Non Governmental Organizations recognize that they have partnerships in the services, but require that their interface with the public administration be made more professional and organized. 
The Government of Cabo Verde also acknowledges that social peace is one of the most important conditions to guarantee an environment of economic growth and sustainable development, based on predictability and the existence and compliance with clear and objective social relations rules. Social peace is inseparable from swift justice and juridical security, which is not compatible with the current situation of the slowness of justice. The problems of justice, the weakness of high-level political dialogue and the scrutiny of civil society, the insufficient legal information on Cabo Verdean society, the relative inadequacy of the judicial assistance system, but also of the makeup of the judiciary, weak specialization of the various branches of justice, the relative delays in the penetration of information and communication technologies, but also, admittedly, the insufficiency of the judges, which is also exacerbated by their dedication to the tasks of court administration, the poor access of magistrates to specialized information, the need for reform of procedures to accelerate the process, but also the processes themselves, the effective and consequent requirement of performance of magistrates, the recognized inadequacy of the system of execution of sentencing and non-recognition and non-adoption and application of voluntary mediation and arbitration. It is about these determinants that the Government of Cabo Verde commits that it will act through the Strategic Sustainable Development Plan, and therefore the Government will act on the determinants of peace through the Strategic Sustainable Development Plan.  
The Cabo Verde Government further acknowledges that security has become a critical element of Cabo Verdean society, with the great challenge of providing residents with an acceptable safety standard and of making Cabo Verde a country with a good level of security for tourism, as the main axis of economic activity. 
It is recognized that there are external threats to security, such as against sovereignty, terrorism and transnational organized crime, which require active and committed participation in the management of regional conflicts and in the fight against transnational crime, identification, mobilization, organization and the provision of resources with effective deterrent potential. 

117


Cabo Verde is not immune to the global impacts of insecurity and should develop alliances for security in the context of deepening its strategic partnership with the European Union and cooperative security with the US. The priority will clearly be for securing documents as well as air, and maritime borders. On the horizon of the PEDS, the Government of Cabo Verde will reduce occurrences by at least 40% and reduce perceived insecurity, especially in urban areas, to levels below 15%, both with respect to fears of being a victim of crime (46%) and in all the most critical contexts such as public transport (32%), when alone at home (40%), when walking alone at night (60%) and when walking alone during the day (19%). 
The Government has adopted the National Program on Homeland Security and Citizenship (PNSIC), which addresses the criminal phenomenon, adopting modern and transversal policies that combine prevention and containment of crime, of the authority and the reinforcement of good citizenship, actions of social inclusion and of adding value to the citizens. 
The Government of Cabo Verde will prioritize, within the framework of the PEDS, the tourist security which is understood to be the security of tourist areas, where people from different parts of the world live together, which constitute a great cultural and linguistic diversity.
In the pursuit of the SDG 16, policy measures such as the creation of a legal and institutional framework for justice, security and human rights for all, as well as the effective functioning of the institutions.
The review of the Criminal Code has strengthened national legislation on various matters of criminal nature, particularly international organized crime and its various manifestations.
The reform of the justice sector, with a view to access to and the speed of it, was embodied in the institution of the Ombudsman Office in 2013, through the Ombudsman entity, in the establishment of Constitutional Court in 2015, and in the establishment and operation of the courts of appeal at the end of 2016.
The consolidation of the National Commission on Human Rights and Citizenship and the approval of the II National Plan for Human Rights and Citizenship have allowed the development of hu-

man rights education strategies, the dissemination of human rights culture in public administration, particularly of justice and security personnel, and the provision of public policies supported in human rights principles and especially with regard to vulnerable groups.
In Cabo Verde the problem of late birth registration was overcome, and according to the 2010 Census, at that time 97% of the children were registered.
The effectiveness in the functioning of the institutions is an objective which is intended to achieve, through the reform of the public administration that is intended to be continued, in order to respond quickly to demand and to be guided by a culture of accountability and transparency.

116



SDG 17. STRENGTHEN THE MEANS 
OF IMPLEMENTATION AND REVITALIZE THE GLOBAL PARTNERSHIP 
FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
Good governance remains one of Cabo Verde's largest assets. According to Mo Ibrahim Foundation Cabo Verde occupies the 4th Best position in Africa. Cabo Verde is integrated into the group of advanced countries, we are, according to Freedom House one of the 1st category countries relating to freedom of the press. We occupy the 27th position in the world in terms of democracy. Also, according to Transparency International, Cabo Verde occupies the 2nd position in Africa and 39th position in the world in the category of low perception of corruption. 
In 2016 three peaceful elections were held, which were, the second consummation of the alternation of government in the democratic era, the third presidential alternation, and municipal elections with profound change, a path that contributes to the consolidation of democracy in Cabo Verde.

However, the indebtedness compromises, at least in the short-term the recovery of economic growth is the result of this new paradigm based on a new economic system which favors a tax that in turn favors business and businesses. The dynamism of economic activity and the level of growth of the economy, the confidence of economic operators, families and international partners, is noticeable.
In line with the Addis Ababa Action Plan, the Government of Cabo Verde prioritizes the mobilization and effective use of internal public resources and is therefore pursuing fiscal reform and transparency, as well as promoting private entrepreneurship and investment as drivers of economic growth, with an emphasis on women's entrepreneurship.
The recovery of economic growth is the result of this new paradigm, based on a new ecosystem that provides a tax regime that favors business, financial and economic inclusion, young entrepreneurship, the development of the social economy, innovative financing solutions for large companies, the promotion of companies and businesses, foreign investment, institutional support for the internationalization of compa-

 VOLUNTARY NATIONAL REPORT ON THE 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2030 AGENDA FOR 
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

nies and the mobilization of financing in the international financial market, the increased density of the business fabric to confer economic opportunities, that has contributed to the rise of the middle class, wealth and employment and, consequently, inclusive economic growth.  The dynamism of economic activity and the level of growth of the economy, the confidence of economic operators, families and international partners, is noticeable. 
 
In the area of public finances, the year 2017 marks the reinforcement of fiscal consolidation, with a focus on the deficit of around 3% of GDP and the fall in the Public Debt / GDP ratio, which declined for the first time in 10 years, reaching 127.4% of GDP. The performance of public revenues, particularly with regard 
to taxes (+11.2%), was a significant and decisive factor in improving the State Accounts, despite the increase in expenses. This new paradigm is also visible in the growth in the level of confidence of economic operators, the increase in domestic private investment and foreign investment, as in the improvement of external accounts with strengthening international reserves, in respect to growth of tourism and the investment prospects in this area.
Effective strengthening of domestic resource mobilization and improved national capacity for tax collection and development finance are therefore under way. Taxes represent about 21% of GDP. The increase in the mobilization of public funding is also evident in the fact that about 79% of the state budget is 
financed by taxes, with strong growth of 5 percentage points between 2016 and 2017.
Due to the graduation of Cabo Verde to a Middle Income Country in 2007, Public Development Aid has been decreasing, reaching an average around 13.6% of the implemented budget. The level reached in 2017, supersedes the average of the last 4 years (10.3%) and this level of performance is due to emergency aid for the reconstruction of Santo Ant\0x201Eo, as to the contribution of the international community to the program to mitigate the effects of the bad agricultural year and to the implementation of the projects of the Millennium Challenge Account, Compact II. However, Foreign Direct Investment gained new momentum, reaching around 6% of GDP in 2017, 

120

but noting however a slight decrease compared to the year 2016 (7%).  In fact, the new financing paradigm is based on both national and foreign private financing, including through public-private partnerships.
In order to achieve this objective, it is the government's intention to strengthen national entrepreneurship through liberalizing policies and regulation of the private sector, facilitating an environment conducive to the growth of the economy and greater intervention of this sector in the financing the country's development.
Emigrants' remittances continue to be one of the pillars of exchange rate sustainability, reaching 9% of GDP in 2017, a slight decrease compared to the year 2016 (10.7%). Cabo Verde is a Middle Income Country, but with a high level of global indebtedness that reached 127.4% of GDP in 2017, with 94.4% for external indebtedness and 32.9% for internal indebtedness.  The level of indebtedness is sustainable, bearing in mind that debt service accounts for about 16% of exports of goods and services. However, the level of indebtedness compromises, at least in the short term, the increase in the indebtedness necessary for the realization of structuring investments. The reduction of the external debt is one of the solutions that the Government of Cabo Verde wants, and the dialogue with partners is ongoing. 
The State of Cabo Verde also prioritizes the promotion of foreign direct investment, as a way of financing development through the movement of capital that does not increase external indebtedness, but above all, aiming at access to world markets for goods and especially services, adding value to the existing business opportunities in the Country and in particular the dynamic insertion of Cabo Verde into the World Economic System.
An undertaking needed is to improve North-South, South-South and triangular cooperation at regional and international levels and access to science, technology and innovation, and increase knowledge-sharing on mutually agreed terms, including through better coordination between existing mechanisms, particularly at the United Nations level, and through a global technology enabling mechanism.
The scientific and technical cooperation agreements with several countries have allowed the development of international partnerships in the framework of North-South, South-South and Tripartite cooperation, and the Government proposes to create the institutional and technical conditions of the institutions mandated to this end to promote the consolidation and diversification of the areas of intervention of these cooperation modalities, with the support of the United Nations.
Connectivity is one of the important elements of \0xB4Leave no one behind\0xAA.  In fact, digital inclusion is essential for access to information and knowledge, for citizen participation and to take advantage of economic and social opportunities. Over the last 10 years, a number of projects have been implemented to promote accessibility for all, including broadening 

 VOLUNTARY NATIONAL REPORT ON THE 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2030 AGENDA FOR 
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

access to the Internet, broadening the scope of universal service with the inclusion of broadband Internet service within universal service and establishing the Universal Service and Information Society Development Fund, concerning the development of the national broadband strategy and the Internet for All program.
In Cabo Verde, around 50% of the population aged ten years and over, use the internet, with slightly more men (50.9%) compared to women (49.8%), but with deep differences between the urban environment where 57,4% of the population in reference uses the internet, and the rural environment, where only 36% of the population makes use of it.  It is mentioned here to any kind of device, emphasizing that only 32.5% of this popu-
lation uses computer, and there is also a slight predominance of men (40.9%) in relation to women (37%).  In the case of the Internet service, in 2006, the year before the liberalization of the electronic communications market, a nominal 1 Mbps (megabit per second) service cost 46,000 CVE per month. While currently the nominal 2 Mbps service costs about 1,120 CVE.
Development financing remains one of Cabo Verde's greatest challenges. Therefore, in line with the Addis Ababa Action Plan, which emphasizes the need to design appropriate methods, allowing a better consideration of the complex realities of the various Middle Income Countries (MICs), the Government of Cabo Verde emphasizes the need for consideration of a Vulnerability Profile in 
defining the criteria for access to public aid for development by Small Island Developing States and financing under concessional conditions, taking into account their vulnerability to disasters and climate changes and phenomena.  As the 2017n2021Sustainable Development Strategic Plan is the first instrument of operationalization of sustainable development goals for the period 20172021, and aiming to achieve the most priority targets, the Government of Cabo Verde will continue to promote its presentation and the lobbying with the international community and potential external partners to mobilize the various existing financing mechanisms, through round tables or partnerships dialogues and thematic conferences in the country and abroad.

122

NATIONAL IMPLEMENTATION MECHANISMS\0xAA
124

The analysis of the MDG progress pointed to the need for a development agenda that would consolidate the gains achieved while allowing a qualitative leap in development. Lessons learned from the achievement of the MDGs underscore the importance of investing in a permanent mechanism to track progress, fulfillment, and escape specific demand at key moments of analysis and accountability.
 
The establishment and reinforcement of post-2015 SDGs monitoring mechanisms and capacities should be addressed from the outset in a small country context to ensure the continued health of national planning and to combine competing priorities that put pressure on the Public Administration, proportioned to the size of the country, with the availability of limited resources and capabilities.
125
As a result of the evaluation of the results in terms of achieving the MDGs, the national development strategies and the implementation of the SDGs, the challenge facing Cabo Verde is creating a favorable environment for the implementation of the transformation and the Sustainable Development Strategic Plan post-2015.
 
Cabo Verde is in the process of formalizing an implementation mechanism to follow the implementation process of the Sustainable Development Strategic Plan (PEDS) and to monitor the integration of the International Development 
 VOLUNTARY NATIONAL REPORT ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
Agendas into national planning. This mechanism, led at the highest level, will consist of Key Ministries, parliamentary representatives, municipalities of Cabo Verde, Civil Society, the private sector and academia.
 
This political body will be technically advised by a Technical Implementation Organization of the SDGs under the coordination of the National Planning Directorate of the Ministry of Finance. The body will be mandated to follow the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Objectives based on the commitments made in 2030 Agenda and will create and make operational Thematic Working Groups organized according to the 4 Dimensions of the SDGs and coordinated by the key sec-

tors, and will ensure coordination with the other sectors and production of periodic implementation reports.
 
IMPLEMENTATION RESOURCES
a) Fund Raising
In Cabo Verde, the mobilization of external partnerships and resources with bilateral partners and multilateral financial institutions, such as banks and development funds, is jointly led by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Finance, in coordination with the Ministry of Economy and Finance. Employment.
As a Small Island Developing State (SIDS) Cabo Verde is a small vulnerable economy that lacks resilience to climate change and environmental shocks. Its middle-income status also means it has more limited access to concessional finance and debt levels have climbed considerably over recent years. Cabo Verde is already trying to reduce public debt burden by privatizing selected State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) and increasing private sector participation in key sectors. Cabo Verde has also put increasing attention to domestic revenues that in percentage points of GDP are already some of the highest in the region (around 20% of GDP). Although there is some scope for improving domestic revenues, and this should be pursued this is an inherent limitation to that given the small size of the economy. 
126
Fiscal space is thus constrained at the time where the country is confronted with the need of financing the ambitious 2030 and Africa 2063 agendas that call for significant investments to further improve infrastructures, human resources and deepen socioeconomic reforms to avoid the so called MIC trap characterized by low investment, slow growth and limited industrial diversification. 
The financing of its own development agenda is therefore becoming increasingly critical and a national priority in itself. With the support of its partners the Government intends to develop a set of new financing instruments, to finance its new 5 years Economic Sustainable Development Plan (PEDS) that its aligned with the 17 Goals. 
Innovative Mechanisms for financing sustainable development: Innovative Mechanisms and solutions such as a The Green Climate Fund (GCF) and the Global Environment Fund (GEF), among other innovative facilities for financing sustainable development, will be developed to achieve the 2030 Agenda. The development of blue bonds, diaspora bonds, as well as green and blue debt swaps will be equally explored, using lessons learned from other countries.
Mixed/blended financing: It is expected that traditional aid, although shrinking, will continue to be important and will be pursued as it can and should play a catalytic role in leveraging these other types of funding. For example, a more strategic use of development finance and philanthropic funds is the mobilization of mixed/blended financing through private capital flows.  
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR): 
Some companies have also engaged in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities in the country, notably contributing to improvement of working conditions. The government has already announced the intention to explore partnerships for impact investments. These may or may not generate direct financial returns, but they can certainly generate beneficial and measurable social and / or environmental impacts. 
Building national technical capacities: In order to access most of these more innovative and promising funding sources potentially available to Cabo Verde, it will be necessary to develop national technical capacities in these areas. 
\0xEF First, the capacities to map and understand the nature and functioning of some of these financial instruments should be developed. 
\0xEF Next, develop project design capabilities that meet the high performance and results-based requirements associated with these funds as required by financial partners (both private and public). 
\0xEF Finally, it will be fundamental to develop a comprehensive coordination mechanism among development partners in Cabo Verde to implement the resources mobilized in order to create synergies and optimize the results achieved with their use.
127
Cooperation and different sources of funding: The support of international community for the transfer of first-line knowledge, including through more effective South-South and triangular cooperation, will be critical to this end. It will also be important to support the diplomatic work being done by Ministry of Foreign Affairs both in Cabo Verde and abroad to raise awareness of the vulnerabilities affecting SIDS countries and thus ensure greater and more simplified access to the different sources of funding. 
Indeed, in line with the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, Cabo Verde urges the international community to collaborate with small island developing states and middle income countries in accessing financing, using new mechanisms and partnerships. These should encourage greater public and private financial participation in these economies and the use of methodologies and indicators that go beyond classical examples thereof n in other words, methodologies and indicators based on economic growth. This is necessary in order to take into greater consideration the different complexities, challenges and realities affecting Middle-Income
b) Production of official statistics  
Sustainable development objectives entail enormous statistics responsibilities that are huge challenges, even for developed countries, especially because of the \0xB4leave no one behind\0xAA principle. The United Nations encourages member states to dis-aggregate national data in order to better disclose who has benefited and who has been forgotten by public policies in recent years, to identify their problems and particularities for their treatment, and to commence with those who are further behind.  
In order to meet this principle of ensuring the statistical production required by the SDGs, it will be necessary to produce statistics with not only more detail, but with a frequency and regularity that is not compatible with the surveys carried out every five years and the censuses carried out every 10 years. Not leaving anyone behind requires the enhancement of geographical detail and social groups, which represent methodological challenges and makes statistics more expensive, as it poses questions of statistical secrecy. It requires access to micro-data to isolate the cases that the averages may conceal, as an example, the population categories that were, or are, at risk of being left behind, and significantly increases the costs of statistical production. 
In this perspective, the National Institute of Statistics (INE-CV) of Cabo Verde, as the entity responsible for the production and availability of the indicators, made a mapping of the availability of the SDG indicators in the country. The result of this mapping showed that the 244 indicators of indicators present in 2030 Agenda, 66% corresponding to 160 are being produced by the various entities in the National Statistical System, 22% corresponding to 55 indicators are not produced and 12% corresponding and 29 indicators were not taken into 
 VOLUNTARY NATIONAL REPORT ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
account in that analysis, since they are indicators for regional or inter-country assessments.
Out of all indicators produced by the National Statistical System (160), only 26% is produced by the INE-CV, corresponding to 41 indicators, and the remaining 74% by other national entities, corresponding to 119 indicators.
The successful course of official statistics since 1997 is partly due to the effort of development partners, to increase production and quality of statistics. Cabo Verde has shared its good practices and participated in the worldwide statistical development effort as an effective member of the United Nations Statistical Commission from 2004 to 2007 and henceforth taking the lead of the Praia Group for Governance Statistics. In its Decision 47/113 of March 2017, the United Nations Statistical Commission expressed its appreciation for the support of the Praia Group for the development of indicators relevant to the goals of Sustainable Development Goal No. 16, and welcomed and approved the action and measures for the development of a statistical manual for the governance of national statistical agencies proposed by the Group. 
The National Statistical Development Strategy 2017-2021 adopts a vision of developing official statistics to respond to the country's major challenges in terms of development plans and programs at the national level (PEDs) and at the international level (SDGs 2030 and Agenda 2063), in a context of political alternation and profound changes in economic policy and in a context in which Cabo Verde's partners (PTF) [1] are more demanding of the country, taking into account its graduation to Middle Development Country (MDC ). The Budget for the 2017-2021 National Statistical Development Strategy is around 23 million american dollars.
This complies with United Nations recommendation on capacity-building and technical assistance, particularly for countries, African countries, least developed countries, developing countries, landlocked countries, Small Island Developing States, conflict or post-conflict situations and other countries in particular situations, so that the states are able to provide the necessary data.
This complies with the commitment to data disaggregation to ensure that the indicators are compatible with the 2030 program's mission, which is to 'Leave no one behind', notably data on aging.
At the 49th Session held in March this year, the United Nations Statistical Commission acknowledged concerted global action is needed to ensure sufficient resources to contribute to the collection of data needed to meet the reporting requirements of the Millennium Development Goals. Sustainable Development Goals, in particular, those of the Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States.
The Government of Cabo Verde urges the international community to adopt 
128
the required partnership to enable major priorities of the 2017-2021 ENDE so that Cabo Verde continues to improve sustainable development management and to follow the path of progress in the implementation of the SDGs and to deepen their contribution to the development of statistics at the global level, in particular through the Praia Group of governance statistics.
NEXT STEPS ON THE SDG IMPLEMENTATION IN CABO VERDE
Review and approve the Road Map for SDG 
Implementation in Cabo Verde The Road Map prepared in June 2016 should be reviewed in the light of the country's new strategic planning document and be jointly approved and implemented by all Stakeholders.
Prepare the SDGs Priorization Report Based on RIA methodology, the SDGs Prioritization Report is prepared, taking into account the level of development of the country, its means and objectives. Prioritization will be a participatory and inclusive exercise with the participation of all stakeholders. UNDP should have an important role to play in its achievement. 
Promote the Positioning of the SDGs at 
Municipality Level.
The SDGs ownership by partners at the local level is therefore crucial to the full understanding of 2030 Agenda as well as to achieving the SDGs. This process can only be carried out in partnership with representatives of local government, as they are closer to citizens and better placed to raise awareness of the importance of SDGs and their relevance to local communities. In this sense, the local development platforms for 2030 Agenda will have to be extended to all the Municipalities of Cabo Verde.
Intensify Capacity Building on SDGs
Intensify actions of appropriation and capacity building in SDGs, the implementers of the SDGs, at the level of Central Government, Local Government and Civil Society. 
129
Take the SDGs to the 10 islands of Cabo Verde Organize inter-island Road Shows to increase awareness and build ownership of the 2030 Agenda and its 17 goals.
SDGs in Cabo Verdean Creole Assure the translation of the 17 goals and their principles into the Creole language in two or more variants of the language.
Implement an SDGs Communication Strategy Developing and implementing a communication strategy for a change of attitude towards SDGs. SDGs are universal so we all have a responsibility to reach them, without exception. Structures exist such as NGO Platforms, SDGs focal points, Local Governments, academia and other partners.
Strengthen the institutional framework for coordinating the implementation of the PEDS and the SDGs Strengthening the institutional framework to coordinate the implementation of the PEDS and SDGs, the government priorities includes strengthening PEDS ownership and clarifying the role of each team and of each manager so that the activities of all public structures have sectoral plans by following PEDS guidelines.  Communication on this strategic plan will be strengthened to the entire hierarchical chain of Public Administration, so that employees know the strategy contributing to fostering participation. Systems will be strengthened for follow-up and discussions based on facts. 
 
CONCLUSION
Cabo Verde addresses the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development with the advantage of having made a great journey within the framework of MDGs, by reaching almost all of the MDGs.
