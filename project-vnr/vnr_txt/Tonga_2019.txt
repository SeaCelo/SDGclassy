The ethos of sustainability has historically been at the heart of Tonga’s development progress. King Tupou I, who ruled Tonga over 170 years ago, adopted the national motto, God and Tonga are My Inheritance which enshrines sustainable development as a way of life. The national motto embodies our inheritance and wealth in the form of people, land, and strong Christian and traditional values underpinning Tongan culture. 
Tonga Strategic Development Framework (TSDF II) 2015-2025 is embedded within the foundations of the nation’s Christian and cultural values. The Framework underscores Tonga’s approach to sustainable and inclusive growth and is aligned to the 2030 Agenda, the SAMOA Pathway, Addis Ababa Agreement, Sendai Framework and others. These have been integrated into the national planning processes and supported by a strong monitoring and evaluation framework. 
Tonga’s VNR report provides an opportunity to share the national development agenda, and account for progress made, including the implementation of relevant Sustainable Development Goals. It highlights the policy and enabling environment in place to integrate and align the Sustainable Development Goals into national planning and policy frameworks, and outlines processes for policy formulation, implementation and monitoring. Vulnerable and disadvantaged groups are also defined, and targeted measures to address special challenges faced have been identified. It provides information on key issues and selected priority programs, as well as, updated priorities contained in the TSDF II 20152025. A few challenges and constraints are discussed, together with opportunities for strengthening the means of implementation. A forward-looking section of the VNR report outlines strategic steps needed to further strengthen the implementation and delivery of Tonga’s development results. It highlights, inter alia, that improved coordination amongst stakeholders, is and, will be instrumental for the effective implementation of our development agenda.
The VNR report provides information on key issues and selected priority programmes, as well as, an update on priorities contained in the TSDF II. To this end, key messages include:
• Tonga has prioritized social protection and human rights with a focus on vulnerable groups. To fully inform policy changes and interventions, Tonga has utilized advanced statistical techniques to enable poverty reporting that is inclusive of smaller island communities and developed a robust multidimensional poverty measure that is reliable, valid and contextually appropriate.
• Tonga continues to honour its commitment to Universal Health Coverage - striving for nationwide coverage and access to quality healthcare services. Non-communicable diseases and communicable diseases are ongoing concerns with high NCD prevalence, low contraceptive use and Sexually Transmitted Infections. Tonga, however maintains low maternal and infant mortality, and high immunization coverage.
• Regulations are in place to make early childhood education inclusive for children with disabilities and children from other vulnerable groups. Improvement to eeffective delivery of sustainable development principles and global citizenship are crucial to learning activities.  Strengthening access to vocational training as well as accreditation to meet international standard is a priority.
• Tonga will continue to enhance accessibility to sustainable and energy efficiency services. Tonga’s energy efficiency target of reducing electricity network losses to 11% of total electricity generation has been achieved in 2017. As of date, Tonga has achieved 10% of the 50% share of renewable energy target by 2020. 
• To strengthen sustainable economic growth through use of relevant trade tools and employment opportunities for our people, we will continue to implement relevant structural reforms and further develop productive sectors. We will also promote decent work including those in the informal sector and public private partnerships for improved service delivery. 
• Tonga recognizes the need for equal opportunities for all, in particular vulnerable and marginalized groups including access to employment, political leadership and social services. This is underpinned by our commitment for all men, women and children to live in an environment free from all forms of violence and exploitation.
• Climate Change continues to pose serious threats to the environment and livelihood of the people of Tonga. A National Climate Change Policy and Joint National Action Plan 2018-2028 provide strategies for climate actions. A Climate Change Trust Fund has been established to strengthen coping capacities of all vulnerable communities.
• Collective efforts are in place to promote the rule of law and strengthen legal institutions to increase access to justice and judicial independence, through the application of international standards in line with our capacities and circumstances. 
• Tonga remains committed to support the implementation of our development agenda through genuine and durable partnerships with development partners, donors and local stakeholders, recognizing national priorities and systems are critical. Further partnerships remain particularly important in areas of finance, appropriate technology, technical support, capacity building and statistics. 
Based on the findings of the VNR, Tongan stakeholders have identified several issues to improve implementation outcomes and delivery of development priorities. The core of the issues is focused on the need to continue with reforms aimed to strengthen national planning systems; decision making processes; whole-of-government approaches; participatory involvement of civil society; efficiency in development cooperation; improved evidence and statistics for policy; and accountable leadership and governance.
Tonga acknowledges that reaching the SDGs by 2030 is a challenge, and that the journey is long mindful of the capacity and resource constraints faced. With adherence to Tonga’s longstanding cultural and traditional values on sustainable development, we aim to achieve the national priorities and the 2030 Development Agenda, through durable partnerships with key stakeholders.
The national motto, God and Tonga are My Inheritance, embodies the inheritance and wealth in the form of the Tongan people, land, and strong Christian and traditional values that underpin Tongan culture. The Kingdom of Tonga, is the only Kingdom left in the South Pacific. Tonga is a constitutional monarchy and has undergone reforms to create a more democratic system of governance. It is a Polynesian archipelago comprising 172 islands, of which 36 are inhabited. Tonga has a population of 100,651 people of whom 70% reside on the main island of Tongatapu. 
As a small island state with limited natural resources, vulnerable to climate change and natural disasters, and faced with several development challenges, Tonga remains committed to achieve the national vision of a more progressive Tonga supporting a higher quality of life for all. 
The national development plan, Tonga Strategic Development Framework (TSDF) II 2015-2025, is results focused, and is embedded within the foundations of the national motto and cultural values. The Framework underscores our approach to sustainable and inclusive growth and is aligned to the 2030 Development Agenda, the SAMOA Pathway, Addis Ababa Agreement, Sendai Framework, amongst others. As appropriate, these global initiatives have been integrated in our sector policies, strategies and national budget measures, supported by a tailored monitoring and evaluation framework at all levels of the national planning process. The 2030 Development Agenda reinforces Tonga’s commitment to ensure the sustainability of the economy, strengthening resilience against the impacts of climate change and natural disasters, and improving social services and development. 
Tonga’s VNR report provides an opportunity to share the national development agenda, and account for progress made, including on the implementation of relevant Sustainable Development Goals. It highlights the policy and enabling environment in place to integrate and align the Sustainable Development Goals into national planning and policy frameworks, and outlines processes for policy formulation, implementation and monitoring. Vulnerable and disadvantaged groups are also defined, and targeted measures to address special challenges faced have been identified. It provides information on key issues and selected priority programs, as well as, updated priorities contained in the TSDF II 20152025. Pertinent challenges and constraints are discussed, together with opportunities for strengthening our means of implementation. A forward-looking section of the VNR report outlines strategic steps needed to further strengthen the implementation and delivery of Tonga’s development priorities.
As a country-led initiative, various national stakeholders took ownership to draft Tonga’s VNR report while considering different national realities, capacities and levels of development, and with respect to national policy priorities. As a result, national ownership developed in terms of understanding progress made, challenges and lessons. Importantly, in consultation with various stakeholders, locally driven messages were identified to support implementation going forward. Representatives of key Ministries and Departments, together with civil society representatives were invited to draft various sections of the VNR report and provided an opportunity to comment on the report in the process of finalizing it. 
Dedicated and inclusive figure 1: Vnr report drafting team with UnDeSA and consultation and drafting UneSCAP staff workshops were convened between March and May 2019. The Prime Minister’s Office led the process of consultation and drafting, in consultation with national stakeholders, including civil society partners. For instance, a week of stakeholder involvement and collaboration helped draft the VNR key messages, with the technical support provided by UNESCAP and UNDP. The national Cabinet considered and approved Tonga’s VNR key messages.  A similar approach was used for the drafting of Tonga’s final report, where a few weeks of extensive and inclusive report drafting was facilitated by the Prime Minister’s Office with specific technical assistance provided by UNESCAP and UNDESA, including a drafting retreat where teams of sectoral stakeholders prepared sections of Tonga’s VNR report. Several iterations of Tonga’s VNR draft report were reviewed by key national and UNESCAP and UNDESA counterparts, prior to finalization and endorsement by Tonga’s cabinet. Figure 1. shows Tonga’s VNR report drafting team with the technical assistance staff from UNDESA and UNESCAP after the opening of one week drafting of the VNR report from 14 to 17 May 2019. 
Significantly and atypically, despite the limited staff capacity and resources, development partner resources were not requested to fund a fulltime consultant to draft Tonga’s VNR report. Instead very specific and selected development partner staff expertise was requested bearing the need to preserve a locally driven agenda and drafting process. This demonstrates national commitment afforded to the 2030 Development Agenda, and its significance in empowering stakeholders to own and lead in the implementation of national and relevant global development priorities.
Even before the 2019 VNR report preparation effort commenced, consultations were open, inclusive, participatory and transparent. Initial preparations were country-led such as the consultations on specific issues in the TSDF II 2015-2025 development, alignment of the TSDF II 2015-2025 to the 2030 agenda, development of the 2019 – 2022 Government Priority Agenda, national workshops were conducted to confirm SDG targets and indicators that are relevant to the TSDF II 2015 – 2025 M&E framework and development of the United Nations Pacific Strategy 2018 – 2022 which outlines response of the UN system to the development priorities of fourteen Pacific Island Countries including Tonga. 
The first four years (post-2015) of mainstreaming of the SDGs into the national frameworks have been instrumental in framing the issues contained in this VNR report. For instance, engagement from the onset with Government line ministries, civil society organizations and public enterprises, led to embedding relevant SDG targets and indicators into the national planning processes. A significant outcome of these efforts was raising ownership for SDGs and making the 2030 Development Agenda an integral part of Tonga’s planning and policy processes. 
In the spirit of the follow-up decisions contained in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Tonga’s VNR preparation, and SDG alignment, integration and implementation efforts were built on existing national planning systems and processes. As such, SDG implementation efforts respond to national circumstances, capacities, needs and priorities, with relevant aspects integrated into the TSDF II 2015-2025, sector and corporate plans, and budgets which guide the operation of line ministries and departments. 
Several key national policy documents have been considered in preparing this VNR report, including His Majesty the King of Tonga’s statements at the United Nations General Assembly and Opening of the Legislative Assembly, as well as, the TSDF II 2015-2025, national budget statements, and sector plans and strategies.
A number of consultative processes on national planning and SDGs took place since the adoption of the 2030 Development Agenda, and when the TSDF II, for the period 2015-2025 was being developed. Several stakeholders, including line Ministries, members of civil society organizations, and representatives from the Legislative Assembly and UN agencies in Tonga, participated in dialogues on sector plan reviews, corporate planning, and budgeting processes. Dedicated SDG localization events also created awareness and understanding of the SDG’s and allowed for contextualization, as appropriate, including the integration of relevant SDG indicators for tracking progress. More so, dedicated workshops to draft the VNR main messages and the report itself, was convened between March and May 2019. The outcomes from these consultations informed Tonga’s VNR report, and raised ownership for, and awareness of, the SDGs. 
Creating ownership of the sustainable development goals and the TSDF II 2015 -2025 is an important priority in Tonga, yet challenging. The challenges include, the need to strengthen collaboration across and within Government line ministries, and with civil society stakeholders in a consistent way. The fact that Tonga’s central and coordinating arms of Government, as well as, line Ministries have limited staffing and institutional capacities exacerbate the situation. However, the approach that Tonga undertook to preparing the VNR report was successful in number of ways. The main reason was that Government line ministries and relevant stakeholders jointly drafted the VNR report, which ensured direct involvement of civil society organizations, at the same time, representatives from Government line ministries were able to dialogue with colleagues within their ministry, as well as, counterparts from other Government ministries. It was apparent from these dialogues that there are a lot of programs that can be better coordinated and integrated. Overall, Tonga’s 2019 VNR process reinforced good practices, and provided lessons for ongoing reforms needed to fully implement the national development and SDG agenda, through strengthened use of national planning systems, well-coordinated statistical system, forming durable partnerships, and leveraging ownership and leadership across the community. 
box 1: government and Csos engagement
Government actively engages civil society organizations in Tonga through programs, projects, collective decision-making by way of public dialogue, consultation meetings, awareness raising programs, capacity building workshops, partnership and 
Government’s National Steering Committees and National Advisory Committees for various Government Ministries.Through mechanisms described in Box 1, an environment for open dialogue is encouraged. However, investment in civic education, political engagement and proactive participation of stakeholders can be strengthened. The SDGs provide an avenue for fundamental rights to be upheld such as the right to life, safety, dignity, non-discrimination, and access to basic needs. Creating higher levels of demand and accountability for development results from all stakeholders means creating ongoing awareness and ownership, which remains work-in-progress.
inCorPoration of tHe sdgs in national frameworKs
 
The sub-sections below describe how Tonga has adapted and integrated the SDGs and targets to national circumstances and systems. Significant amount of work has been completed to tailor planning, budgeting, monitoring and reporting systems, with solid progress to-date. An overall aim being the need to improve integration of the three dimensions of sustainable development, whilst, ensuring targeted support to those most disadvantaged and vulnerable. To align and integrate SDG’s into Tonga’s national systems, as well as, localize the SDG indicators and establish a tailored monitoring system, dedicated stakeholder consultations were convened including with civil society partners.
i. Alignment of the SDGs with Tonga Strategic Development Framework II 2015-2025
In order to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its sustainable development goals (SDGs), including the internationally agreed blueprint for the sustainable development of small island developing States (SIDS), the SAMOA Pathway, both commitments have been made an integral part of Tonga’s national planning processes. 
The TSDF II 2015 – 2025 is Tonga’s roadmap for the achievement of the SDGs, cognisant of guiding principles underscored in the 2030 UN Development Agenda, namely the need to account for national realities, capacities, levels of development and respecting national policies and priorities.
In this context, TSDF II 2015-2025 outlined seven National Outcomes in which all focus on more inclusive and sustainable (MIS) development. The seven are national outcomes include: (a) MIS dynamic knowledge-based economy; (b) MIS urban and rural development across all island groups; (c) MIS empowering human development with gender equality; (d) MIS responsive and good governance strengthening rule of law; (e) MIS successful provision and maintenance of infrastructure and technology; (f) MIS effective land administration, environment management and resilience to climate and risk; and (g) MIS sustainable and consistent advancement of our external interests, security and sovereignty.
In November 2015, Tonga undertook a process to align the seventeen SDGs to the seven National Outcomes of the TSDF II 2015 – 2025 through RAPID Integrated Assessment (RIA), which also aimed to review Tonga’s readiness to implement the SDGs. This process allowed for stakeholder consultation and consideration of SDG priorities in a Tongan context. The outcome of the alignment is depicted in Figure 2.

Goal 7: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all
G. more inclusive, sustainable and consistent advancement of our external interests, Goal 17: Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize security and Sovereignty the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development
Through these considered and elaborate processes, integration of the social, environment and economic pillars of sustainable development have been integrated into the seven National Outcomes of the TSDF II, thus reinforcing a sound platform for Tonga’s implementation of its national development agenda, in sync with the 2030 Development Agenda.
ii. Alignment of the Tonga Strategic Development Framework with other Regional Frameworks
Tonga also applied the Rapid Integrated Assessment (RIA) Tool to also align TSDF II 2015 -2025 to other relevant frameworks, such as Addis Abba, S.A.M.O.A Pathway, SENDAI, and Framework for Pacific Regionalism. Results of the mapping between the TSDF II 2015 -2025 and selected frameworks are found in Figure 3. The alignment process underscored the value of the TSDF II 2015-2025 as the master strategy for Tonga to implement the 2030 Development Agenda. The consolidation of relevant aligned aspects of global and regional frameworks into the TSDF II streamlines the monitoring and reporting needs, cognizant of limited capacity.

The Tonga Strategy for the Development of Statistics (TSDS) has been developed to enable the production, management and use of statistical information and indicators that is needed to inform the development and implementation of policies, interventions and the monitoring of progress towards achieving sustainable development goals. TSDS is an inclusive and sustainable National Statistical System (NSS) for effectively responding to the emerging demands from development agendas. TSDS is discussed further in the “next step” section.  
iv. Localisation of SDG targets and indicators
The next step Tonga took to incorporate SDGs into its national planning systems included, engagement with stakeholders to discuss and confirm relevant SDG targets and indicators which could be used to track the implementation of the TSDF II and sectoral priorities. In the process, Tonga started by adapting sixty-nine SDG indicators and integrated relevant aspects in applicable documents and through data validations and reality checks, more indicators were added. Please refer to Annex I: SDG and TSDF II indicators that have been integrated into Tonga’s national monitoring system. 
However, the measurability of key indicators remain a challenge and ongoing capacity building effort is planned to progress. Significant areas such as climate change and ocean concerns are particularly difficult to measure as indicators are currently classified as Tier II and Tier III. Nonetheless, policy measures in response to critical challenges have been developed e.g. a National Climate Change Policy and a Joint National Action Plan 2018-2028 providing strategies for climate actions and disaster risk management.
v. Strengthened national monitoring system – tracker database
With UN support, Tonga has established a fit for purpose monitoring system which maps key policy, planning and budget documents, including the TSDF II 2015-2025 outcomes and outputs, related KPIs and the 2030 Agenda goals, targets and indicators. Figure 4 depicts the tailored planning and monitoring system developed to integrate the SDGs, especially the corporate planning and budgeting systems in Tonga.  
A tracking database system was developed to establish a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework for Tonga at the same time, strengthen the corporate planning and budgeting linkages. The effectiveness of the tracker database housed with the National Planning Division, Prime Minister’s Office, largely depends on capacity to input quality and reliable information on a timely basis and interoperability with other public sector M&E systems such as that used by the Public Service Commission and Tonga Statistics Department. 
figure 4: tailored planning and monitoring system developed to integrate the SDGs into the tSDf II

vi. Strengthened planning and budgeting processes
Tonga is committed to improving the links between national (and sector) plans and budgets in order to ensure that development priorities are resourced for implementation as planned. In this context, a tailored tool (called One Process) has been operationalized in order to better allocate resources for targeted outputs. Overall, the One Process Tool is intended to help improve the service delivery performance of whole-of- Government through eight components outlined in Figure 5. figure 5: eight components of one Process tool

To help with more integrated decisions accounting for environment and social considerations at activity and project levels, an innovative tool (called the Risk Resilience Tool Kit) has been developed – refer to Box 2 for details.
boX 2: risk resilience tool Kit
A Risk Resilience Tool Kit has been developed to guide corporate planners to identify and assess risks associated with project activities. When a risk is identified, the issue is referred to the appropriate authority for consideration of risk management measures. This assists planners to find ways to improve the resilience of project activities, and ensure they are more inclusive and sustainable accounting for climate change, natural disasters and environmental concerns. More so, this results in better reflection of vulnerability and risks to Tongan communities into project design and implementation activities. By screening projects and activities for risks, better coherence is possible to support achievement of the sustainable development outcomes of the TSDF II. 
Definition of risk is the likelihood of a hazard or change occurring, and the probability of damaging consequences for vulnerable and exposed organizational assets, stakeholders, resources and activities. 
Institutional processes have been updated to utilize the Tool Kit. The Ministry of Finance has a mandatory requirement in relevant project proposal and funding application forms to assess for elements of the Tool Kit. More so, the Tool Kit is used to screen community development projects for economic, social, and environment opportunities and risks.
vii. Mainstreamed SDGs targets and indicators to Government ministries’ 
and public enterprises corporate plans
Figure 6 demonstrates how SDGs targets and indicators have been mainstreamed into the Government line ministries’ corporate plan template. Outcome level targets and indicators generally show change over the medium-term and linking these to the output level targets and indicators provides an opportunity to track progress in shorter-term intervals. Such a tracking mechanism allows for more frequent information to be gathered, in turn, allowing for policy analysis and review, to support improved development outcomes. The intention of the SDG targets and indicators being incorporated into the template below is to ensure usage by all line ministries for evidence-based decision making such as policy creation, revision and interventions.

In Tonga’s context, the principle of leaving no one behind has been categorized into four main areas including 1) remote communities; 2) persons with disability; 3) elderly, adolescent and children and 4) people with diverse sexual orientation. Tonga recognizes the need for equal opportunities for all, in particular vulnerable and marginalized groups including access to employment, political leadership and social services. This is underpinned by our commitment for all men, women and children to live in an environment free from all forms of violence and exploitation. Outlined below are selected examples of policies activities provided under each of these four areas, noting that without such support many people would be left behind.
i. Remote communities
The internationally accepted concept of Universal Health Coverage is a vital element for the nation’s development. In this context, a key government initiative is to cater to populations in remote areas, through major renovations and service delivery improvements in outer island hospitals. These include infrastructural upgrades, for instance at the Likamonu Hospital of Niuatoputapu (furthest away from the capital Nuku’alofa) as shown in Figure 7 after its devastation by the tsunami in 2009. 
figure 7: newly built hospital in remote niuatoputapu One of the key barriers to Universal Health Coverage is decentralizing some medical services and medical officers to the Community Health Centres to encourage the respective communities to utilize the Community Health Centres as their primary point for service delivery. This would alleviate the workload on the main hospital and allow the reallocation of health personnel to more specialized and critical areas.
ii.  Persons with disability
To strengthen capacity of health workers and integrate mental health into primary health care, Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) training is planned to be introduced in 2019 with support from WHO. The aim is to train doctors and nurses for improved assessment and management of common mental disorders. mhGAP training material is already incorporated into nursing curriculum at Queen Salote Institute of Nursing and Allied Health. 
With donor support, a fit for purpose vehicle is in operation to transport elderly patients and people with disabilities. More so, recent partnerships have delivered prosthetic legs for those in need, as well as a mental health unit at the Hu’atolitoli Prison allow for more inclusive healthcare.
A Government initiative facilitated by the Ministry of Internal Affairs since 2015, assists persons with extreme disabilities through cash transfers valued at T$75 per month. Identification of those eligible is determined by the Ministry of Health, and includes those with physical, psychiatric, intellectual/ learning/neurological, and sensory impairment disabilities. The cash assistance is disbursed by the Ministry of Finance to the relevant bank accounts of the recipients, with promotes financial inclusion. In 2018, fifty-one percent of all recipients are females, with the assistance covering all major island groups in Tonga. Recipients are predominantly those with physical disabilities (59%), followed by intellectual, learning and neurological (21%) and psychological (12%) and those with diagnosis not clear (6%) or unknown (2%) disabilities. Eighty one percent of all recipients in Tongatapu were children ages 6-10. 
 
iii. Elderly, adolescent and children
Several dedicated programs aimed to improve development outcomes for the elderly, adolescent and children are in place. For example, in collaboration between the Pediatrics Ward at Tonga’s main hospital (Vaiola hospital) with New Zealand’s Starship Hospital enabled the provision of chemotherapy for children with Leukemia. A partnership between the Government of Tonga and NGO Ma’a Fafine mo Famili, provides services and care to some of the most vulnerable in the society, including elderly people (60+ years old) whose families no longer have the resources to properly care for them and the young children (0-4 years old) with disabilities.  
iv. People with Diverse Sexual Orientation

In partnership with Government, the Tonga Leiti’s Association, focused on people with diverse sexual orientation continues to implement awareness on gender issues, and screening programs for HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases. The Tonga Leiti’s Association also conducts outreach services not only in the main island but the outer islands of Vava’u, Ha’apai and ‘Eua.

figure 8: tonga Leiti’s Association outreach

institutional meCHanisms
 
A number of institutional arrangements are in place to support implementation of the TDSF II and the 2030 Development Agenda. The Planning Division in the Office of the Prime Minister coordinates implementation of the SDGs in Tonga. It coordinates multi-sectoral involvement, harmonizes different workstreams and ensures that all ministries are involved in cross-cutting efforts to achieve the SDGs.
A critical lesson learnt from this VNR process, is that having a coordination body for SDG localization is key in order to make sure that ownership is anchored on the TSDF II 2015-2025, and cascades through to Government priority agenda, sector plans, corporate plans of Government line ministries then to the annual budget. These processes need to be connected with an appropriate M&E framework tied to a reporting regular process.  In support of this ambition, Cabinet has recently approved the establishment of the Tonga Sustainable Development Taskforce and a Technical Working Group. The Taskforce’s main purpose is to consider and endorse annual reports on progress made in the implementation of the TSDF II 2015-2025 and the localized SDGs. Its membership includes representatives from Government, Civil Society Organizations, Church Leaders Forum, United Nations Joint Presence Office Coordinating Officer and Chamber of Commerce. At the same time, the Technical Committee has been established to support the core role of the Taskforce, and to focus on preparing the technical aspects of reporting including strengthening data capacities and collection systems, monitoring and analysis.
In Tonga, due partly to its size, there is little distinction in tiers of government. Decisions taken by the central government provide direction for the sub-national and local levels of government. The subnational and local levels of government do not have authority to collect any form of tax, and their budgets and operation are all funded by the central government. However, community development plans also reflect the SDGs and the TSDF II principles. In the process of formulating community development plans, the key national regulatory instruments are directed by the Ministry of Internal Affairs which oversees the implementation of the SDGs related to local government, women’s affairs and youth. Community development planning follows the multi-sectoral consultation at the national level. For example, in local government work, the consultations are driven by NGOs to all communities, and the implementation is a joint collaboration of NGOs, private sector, and communities themselves. This coordinated approach ensures that all stakeholders are involved in the country’s development agenda and the SDGs.
Some of the challenges to setting up stronger institutional mechanisms to implement the SDGs include geographical diversity and remoteness, as well as having effective coordination. The TSDF II 2015 – 2025 provides a coordination mechanism as shown in Figure 9 which outlines how each Government line ministries, business community, CSOs, churches, community and the National Reserve Bank of Tonga contribute to achieving the TSDF II 2015-2025 outcomes. Despite the existence of this coordination mechanism, outreach programs still need to be strengthened to create awareness and more importantly ensure implementation is done accordingly.
Tonga’s Office of the Auditor General, provides an independent oversight mechanism for assessing the performance of government in ensuring institutional and enabling mechanisms are in place for TSDF II and SDG implementation. Most significantly, the Office of the Auditor General has prepared a performance audit of Tonga’s SDG implementation processes and a report will be tabled in the national Parliament for scrutiny and debate. Such an outcome indicates the transparency of government’s operations to support SDG implementation, and raises the level of accountability given the scrutiny through the processes of Parliament and the eventual public access to the audited information.

struCtural issues
 
A number of structural factors constrain development and growth prospects of Tonga, like many other Pacific Small Island Developing States. These include the challenges posed by: smallness; geographical dispersion within Tonga and isolation from major world markets; and vulnerability to climate change and natural disasters. 
Given the diseconomies of scale, private sector opportunities and job creation remain a challenge, resulting in a significant public sector role in the economy and for service delivery.  In specific terms, remoteness contributes to higher transaction costs of delivering goods and services, including essential items like food, medicines and fuel. More so, the geographic dispersion of Tonga’s population in remote and outer islands means the cost and effectiveness of service delivery (for example in areas of health, utilities, and education) is sub-optimal.

Tonga’s VNR provides an update on priorities contained in TSDF II 2015-2025, which has incorporated all SDGs as relevant. The processes undertaken to align and integrate SDGs into the national planning framework and process have been discussed earlier. The key national outcomes focus on more inclusive and sustainable development, including knowledge-based economy; urban and rural development; empowering human development; responsive and good governance; provision and maintenance of infrastructure and technology; effective land administration, environment management and resilience to climate and risk; and advancement of external interests, security and sovereignty. 
This section will outline each of the seven National Outcomes of the TSDF II 2015-2025 and highlight programs and activities. It further elaborates on the alignment depicted in Figure 2 above. 
Tracking progress using Tonga’s priority SDG indicators suggests progress in all areas of TSDFII and the 17 SDGs, particularly in Goals 1,3,5 and 6. An overall depiction of progress is captured in Figure 10.
Given data and information gaps, to fully quantify progress against each priority is a challenge. However, the estimates used in Figure 10 provides a strategic view on the direction of progress being made. There remain a number of indicators without methodology (Tier 3 indicators) and some for which no national data is currently available. Tonga Statistics Department is conducting key household collections to address some of these data gaps, with analysis of survey underway, and a MICS (Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey) being conducted in the second half of 2019.
The section that follows captures both quantitative and qualitative discussion of progress being made in specific areas.


While Tonga seeks much more than just an improved standard of living, economic growth is a core part of improving quality of life. With limited resources, and a relatively stable population, there is limited human capital and natural capital to drive growth. Stronger knowledge and service-based industries (including export of more skilled labour) are important, given the limits to the development of primary and secondary industries possible in Tonga.
Within the primary and secondary industries, however, the application of new knowledge and technologies have the potential to increase the value-added of production. For example, the value of agricultural and marine produce could be greatly increased by value-added processing rather that exporting in primary form. Without greater value-added, income cannot be optimally increased. To this end, Tonga requires new skills, technology and infrastructure.
At the same time, these developments must respect the environment and avoid over- exploitation, which in some instances has resulted in a short-term jump in growth followed by over- use, destroying the very resource upon which we depend. This is not sustainable. It is also important that these opportunities, as far as possible, are developed across the Kingdom and that it includes participation from people in both the informal and formal sectors. In this way, more inclusive access to income and employment opportunities will be realized.
Selected and relevant SDGs in the context of TSDF II National Outcomes A are briefly discussed below.
 SDG 1: Poverty alleviation
The kingdom has recognized the importance of alleviating poverty and reducing hardship faced by some disadvantaged sections of the Tongan community. Based on the international poverty measure for extreme poverty of USD$1.90 per person per day, it is estimated that 3% of the Tongan population fall in this category. Between 2009 and 2016, the percentage of population in this category has increased from 1% to 3%, which is of policy concern.
Accordingly, the Ministry of Internal Affairs is finalizing a Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) Scheme. This is a poverty policy benefit scheme targeting those who are extremely monetary poor. 
Recently Tonga has developed a robust multidimensional poverty measure which is scientifically valid, reliable, additive and contextually appropriate. It has been adopted as the national poverty measure, and is the first of its kind in the Pacific. This is important because recent research has suggested that income poverty measures can underestimate the true extent of poverty. Therefore, effective poverty reduction policies require measures that go beyond income and appropriately reflect the hardship and life experiences of the poor and disadvantaged groups. 
In the spirit of the 2030 Development Agenda, this measure identifies the ‘proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definition’. While the impact on an adult falling into poverty temporarily may be felt immediately, for children the effects can last a lifetime as children need access to education and healthcare to gain the best start in life. Child poverty costs society in terms of missed opportunities and wasted potential. This measurement is a new development for Tonga as child poverty is no longer lumped together with general poverty assessments which often focus solely on income levels, and do not consider basic necessities. The measure allows Tonga to fully understand child poverty.
boX 3: national Poverty measure – leaving no one behind
Using this poverty measure Tonga can report multiple dimensions: 
• the poor - those that experience both low income and are also materially and socially deprived; 
• those vulnerable because of deprivation - socially perceived necessities (items and activities) that the Tongan majority 
consider that no-one should go without; and
• those vulnerable because of income - measured at the household level and takes into account both monetary (e.g. wages) and non-monetary sources (e.g. self-production).Using this measure, it is estimated that 27% of the population are poor. Furthermore, 14% of the population is estimated to be vulnerable as a result of deprivation, and 22% vulnerable in terms of income measures. Child and adult poverty rates indicate that one in five adults are poor compared to one in three children. 
Notably, the most common forms of deprivation among children have to do with household level items, i.e. items that are shared by all household members, such as electrical goods and making regular savings for emergencies. As such, interventions to reduce poverty among children must consider household conditions, as well as, the situation of children themselves. The same pattern is apparent for adults, with household level items showing the highest deprivation rates. 
 
Currently, the survey does not collect information on housing conditions, e.g. state of repair or roofs and walls. Further information on housing conditions would be useful to inform policy interventions.
Risk factors have been identified for child and adult poverty. Households with a large number of children, as well as those with one or two adults are at higher risk of poverty. Policies addressed at reducing child poverty are likely to improve the conditions of those households.
The evidence presented in this report indicates that education is effective in protecting households from poverty. Households where the head has university qualifications or higher are the least likely to be poor, followed by those with secondary school qualifications. The highest poverty rates correspond to households where the head has primary school or no qualifications.
 SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth
The Government has endorsed programs aiming at protecting labour rights and promoting safe and secure working environments for all workers. It has completed national consultations with stakeholder groups on a draft Employment Relations Bill that is now pending discussions at the Legislative Assembly. It is envisaged that by establishing and improving labour conditions in Tonga – through implementation of minimum conditions of employment, fair employment practices by businesses, facilitating the right of redress for employers and employees – employees and employers will equally benefit, thereby contributing to improved standards of living and poverty reduction. 
Tonga became a member of the International Labour Organization (ILO) in 2016 and has since embraced the four pillars of the ILO’s Decent Work Agenda - to promote job creation, social dialogue, safeguard rights at work, and extend social protection. Despite the challenges of resource constraints, Tonga has made progress in terms of extending social protection coverage beyond traditional forms, establishing the baseline for social dialogue between Government and social partners and at workplaces, regulatory reforms to safeguard rights at work, and work collaboratively with its stakeholders on employment creation initiatives.
boX 4: economic development reform focus areas
• Grassroots entrepreneurship and Business Development Support reform: a strategy to increase grassroots participation in business and build their capacity to grow and be competitive.
• Grassroots export Development Support reform: a strategy to increase grassroots participation in export activities.
• Diaspora engagement for Inclusive economic Development reform: a strategy to harness diaspora investments and remittances for inclusive economic development.
• Grassroots employment Support 
reform: a strategy to facilitate the access of the informal sector to employment opportunities.
• Pro-Poor Price Control reform: a strategy to improve the access of the poor to basic goods and services through price regulation.As far as progress made on SDG 8 – “Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and descent work for all”, Government has established an “Inclusive Economic Development Reform” programme, motivated not only by its prominence in the Tonga Strategic Development Framework (TSDF II) 2015-2025, but driven also by a large informal sector and the rising rates of poverty and hardship in the country.  It is estimated that over 80% of the business ventures in the country operate in the informal sector. The latest population census of 2016 revealed that 43% of the working aged population of the country were either unemployed or underemployed in subsistence farming. The prominent size of the under-employed is part of the reason for the significant increase in unemployment from 6.5% in the 2011 census, to 16.4% in 2016. The Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2015/16 also identified that the majority of those with paid wages and salaries are in sectors, which are predominantly informal in nature – agriculture, handcrafts, fisheries and forestry.  
The agriculture sector has remaining potential to offer opportunities for employment and livelihood. To this end, the Tonga Agriculture Sector Plan 2016 to 2020 was prepared and focusses on: climate resilient environment targeting preservation of healthy soils, water supply, farming systems and resilient communities; enabling environment addresses regulation and compliance, export and import policies, land and rural finance policies; sustainable livelihoods and healthy; and sustainable economic growth and foreign exchange earnings targeting increased export and import substitution.  
Government recognizes that it is essential for decent work to be central in its economic development policy making and plans for increased inclusiveness and poverty reduction.  To this end, a number of labour market reform programs, in consultation with its key relevant stakeholders, have been the development of minimum labour standards and a legal framework to govern national employment. 
These reforms are focused on five areas outlined in Box 4.

The dispersed geographical nature of Tonga, with many small communities on many small islands, requires particular effort for sound development and management of urban and rural areas. The dispersion of Tonga has important consequences for access to development and participation to promote greater inclusion. It is impossible to have equal levels and quality of infrastructure, equal access to services, and equal development on all islands. It is important, to plan for better balance between the growth of strong urban centers and viable rural areas across the island groups. To be effective, this balance must also promote development in areas less prone to damage from extreme natural events. More balanced development may help to discourage the resettlement of people from outer islands and rural areas to urban centers.
SDG 11 in the context of TSDF II National Outcome B is briefly discussed below.
 SDG 11: Sustainable communities
Tonga still depends significantly on the extended families and links to the nobility and Royal family for much of our support and social interaction. A complex system of reciprocity and social exchange is maintained as part of these relations. These relationships are widespread. Some of these social arrangements are helpful for the development of a progressive, dynamic and inclusive Tonga, while others have become a burden on progress, even a burden on the daily quality of life. Some traditions, such as kava drinking, provide inclusion for those who participate, while excluding women and members of churches that ban kava drinking.
The rapid changes taking place to our social and economic conditions are undermining many of our traditional ways and social strengthen. The large population movements within Tonga and between Tonga and the rest of the world are changing our traditions and bring new ideas, values and behaviours. Some of these enhance, while others undermine, the quality of our life. Some groups of immigrants are less well integrated into our social systems.
Improved collaboration between civil society, community groups and government is essential for human development, mitigating the negative impacts of change, helping disabled groups, increasing inclusion and improving the quality of life. Government has neither the resources nor the capacity to provide this support on its own. As with business development, government can play an important role in enabling the maintenance and development of strong communities, however, a wide mix of individuals, CSOs and other social groups must work together. The need for this close collaboration is increasing in face of rapid social and economic change. 
Given the small size of Tonga and its limited resources, there is limited scope for a complex multi-tier system of governance from national to local level. At the same time, however, some decentralization of government administration is necessary given the dispersed nature of the country and to ensure that the public has easy access to administrative services. The government administration in Tonga is supported by a network of Town and District Officers across the Kingdom. The development of offices for Members of Parliament in their constituencies is further helping to improve the outreach of government to be more responsive to local needs. More still needs to be done to strengthen this and to ensure more inclusive access across the Kingdom. The size of Nuku’alofa is also raising questions about the best way of ensuring an integrated management of the main urban centre.
Tonga has a complex land system, designed by Tupou I to provide wide access to land and protect families from poverty. This system has many strengths, including avoiding the permanent loss of access to land services. On the other hand, an effective lease system and efficient land management and planning for the allocation of public faculties, transport and other needs is required. The lack of such planning and management, combined with inefficient administration of land laws and regulations in Tonga is resulting in inefficient urban and rural development and lack of space for important public spaces and infrastructure. It is also slowing development. Increased monetization of traditional land practices is also undermining the design of the land access system.
Improved land use planning, management and administration with stronger and appropriate enforcement which ensures the better provision of public spaces as well as private spaces, ensures more appropriate placement of infrastructure, better protects the environment and limits risks, so as to improve safety conditions both for communities and business, working in harmony with a better application of the traditional land management system. 
In 2016, Government launched 126 Community Development Plans (CDPs) which documented disaggregated needs and priorities, with more proactive measures to ensure those needs not identified or represented are taken into account, specifically those of women, men and youths. In the process of formulating the community development plans, sex and age disaggregated data accompanied with social vulnerability assessments are captured to inform development priorities. Gender and social inclusion approaches are taken to ensure all needs and priorities of minority groups, and those most at risk are taken into account. There has been increased investment in community development priorities under the Transformation of Rural Innovation Project II (2018-2023), with improved coordination of support across all development partners. 
Figure 11 shows a positive outcome of overseas development assistance brought into one of the outer islands. Hunga Island which is located in Vava`u. The Government of India built main road and a jetty which has facilitated trade, eased accessibility for the people of Hunga hence, reduced inequality. Prior to this investment, accessibility to and from the Hunga Island was a great challenge. figure 11: road and jetty project at Hunga Island

Figure 12 shows residents of the village of Folaha, Tongatapu commissioning a clean water supply system through financial assistance received from the Japanese Government. Such projects allow for improved access to basic needs in remote communities.  
figure 12: Water access project

The development of our human capital is essential for progress across all the TSDF II National Outcomes. For instance, skilled people to operate and maintain infrastructure, to build dynamic businesses, to negotiate better internationally and to improve the public service. This requires good education, health and other services that reach out across the Kingdom, particularly to groups with special needs. Improved gender balance is necessary so that both women and men can progress together. An absence in any of these areas will hold people back, undermine human development, limit growth, equality and restrain development progress.
Selected and relevant SDGs in the context of TSDF II National Outcome C is briefly discussed below.
 SDG 3: Good health and well-being
Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) have reached a critical level in Tonga. Given this concern, a Taskforce is a multi-sectoral committee, established to coordinate and provide oversight on NCDrelated activities, with Sub-Committees focusing on the main risk factors namely: physical activity, alcohol, healthy eating and tobacco control. At the same time, partnerships between the Government and civil society organizations have been strengthened to create a collaborative and collective effort around family planning, adolescent/youth, child and maternal health.
  
boX 5: success stories worth highlighting
• Introduction of three new vaccines (HPV, Pneumococcal, Rotavirus and possibly Mumps).
• Tonga’s under five mortality is very good >98% and out neonatal mortality rate is also excellent.
• Tonga had been declared Lymphatic Filariasis Free in 2017.
• Malaria is virtually eradicated.
• The proportion of birth attended by skilled health personnel is also high >90%.
• Chemotherapy for Children with Leukemia (ALL) is available locally in Tonga since 2009 and has been an ongoing collaboration with Star ship Hospital (New Zealand) and is service provided to date. Much public investment has been towards alleviating NCDs. However, a multi-sectoral approach to address all aspects of NCD holistically is needed including physical activity, nutrition, availability of healthy and reduced access to unhealthy foods, taxing tobacco, policies and procedures. Given the scope of these initiatives, coordinated and participatory efforts are needed. For instance, support was provided to churches given the outreach and influence in society, to develop work plans aimed at promoting healthy lifestyle programs in their respective congregations. These workplans included physical activity, cooking lessons and screening for NCDs.  
boX 6: Partnership approach
The Early Childhood Obesity Program targets healthy eating “Kai Mo’ui lelei: Suka Fe’unga”, aimed at children to reduce the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and sugary foods. Success requires the  involvement of many stakeholders in schools, churches, community and household level. Childhood obesity is among the key risk factors for NCDs and other behavioral, emotional and social difficulties that can lead to stigmatization, poor socialization and reduced educational attainment among many young children.Through the establishment of the RMNCAH Committee, 	the 	partnerships 	between 	the Government and Non-Government Organizations have been strengthened to create a collaborative and collective effort around family planning, adolescent/youth, child and maternal health.
Pinktober (Breast Cancer Month) is organised annually to promote early detection of breast cancer and to improve chances of survival. Breast cancer cases continues to remain significant with around 30 new cases each year. The Pinktober initiative creates awareness on breast cancer, and data shows that women respond and predominantly use the mammography screening during the October.
To address the issue of improved statistics, data sharing and multi-sectoral collaboration, the Health and Justice Ministries and the Statistics Department have collectively validated vital statistics, and compiled the National Health Indicators, amongst others. The collaboration between these entities remains strong as they work together to address issues with the birth and death registration coverage as registration of death for women and children is under-recorded. 
A mental health policy has been developed and figure 13: opening ceremony for Breast highlights the need to revise the Mental Health Cancer month Act, establish a dedicated mental health section, increase staff to provide mental health care, increase capacity of mental health treatment among primary and general health staff, and increase community mental health services.
The impacts of illicit drugs in the Tongan society lead Government to include combating illicit drugs as one of its top priorities since 2018.  Even though this has been identified by Government, it is indeed a priority for the of whole society seeing the impacts it has on national security, families, individuals including youths. In fact, about 20% - 70% of patients monthly admission to the psychiatric unit consumed cannabinoids and/or methamphetamine. Government is now directing a lot of its resources especially financial resources to support ministries and departments that are mandated to counter impacts of illicit drugs. For instance, Ministry of Customs to strengthen the border control, Ministry of Police to improve law and order and domestic security and Ministry of Health for medical services. In terms of mental health, the Mental Health Act is currently under-review and Mental Health Policy has been developed awaiting endorsement. At the same time, this also highlights the need to build the capacity of mental health services. 
 
 SDG 4: Quality education
boX 7: government initiatives ensuring children have access to education
Government kept to its national policy of providing a primary school within 1 mile from children’ village, since 1950s, which ensures the right to education is not hindered by poverty and location, especially children at rural and remote areas. Starting from 1980s the government expanded some district primary schools to middle schools, adding first two years of secondary schooling, with free tuition support aimed to reducing financial hardship and improve access to education. A notable recent development is the expansion of compulsory education age from ages 6 - 14 to ages 4 - 18 which has been legislated. This legislation recognizes the importance of Early Childhood Education (ECE) to improve readiness of children to enter primary school. Another initiative with support from the World Bank called Pacific Early Age Reading and Learning (PEARL), focuses on ensuring competency in reading and writing at ECE and initial years of primary and setting up of community play-based centres for children below age 4, as well as a nationwide campaign of “10 minutes a day reading with your child”. The success of the intervention has resulted in a policy decision to extend the competency and reading initiative to all of primary level students, and expand to competency in maths and science as well.
A significant partnership exists between faith-based organisations and village communities with government to support the delivery of ECE. In this context, the Ministry of Education continues to strengthen its pre-service and in-service training programme for ECE teachers, as well as manage curriculum and quality aspects. Pre-service training starts with certificate (1-year and 2-year) programmes, then diploma and degree level programme which was first offered in 2017.  
Support programs have been setup for TVET studies.  In 2019, a World Bank programme targeting students from poor and remote locations have been provided funding for secondary level till completion of TVET or tertiary studies.
Current data gaps hamper policy formulation and analysis, and an Education Management Information System (EMIS) is required to better inform specific interventions. For instance, disaggregate data of school and student performance can support targeted measures for school leavers as well as, other students to complete secondary studies and create a pathway into TVET and tertiary studies, and career opportunities.  
Apart from TVET programs, specific livelihood skills at the secondary and post-secondary level, such as rugby academy are offered. To complement these, the Kaliloa Leadership Program, a national leadership program for senior secondary student is jointly offered with Ministry of Police and His Majesty’s Armed Services, together with ‘music for peace’, which is a peace-building program promoting brass band skills and music talents, which has helped break school barrier and conflicts. Government continues to encourage the partnership of Ministry of Education with other line ministries and NGOs on initiatives develop relevant curriculum and deliver in common areas of interest, such as healthy eating, dental health, physical activity, good sanitation, disaster preparedness, that all enrich education quality. 
Government is looking at ways to tackle the ICT challenge for every student to be digital literate at secondary school. Further infrastructure development is needed to facilitate wider e-government initiatives and affordable internet connection to outer island to fully roll-out digital literacy programs in schools.
The Education Sector Development Plan for the next decade is currently being reviewed and will strengthen access to education initiatives cognisant of SDG related targets, together with improved quality of learning and teaching.
 SDG 5: Gender equality
A National Study on Domestic Violence against Women in Tonga found high prevalence of violence and abuse in Tonga with 3 out of 4 women experiencing physical or sexual violence in their lives by a partner or non-partner. Some of the studies found were unique to Tonga for example the study found that women in Tonga experience violence by non-partners (especially fathers and teachers) 3 times more often than by partners. figure 14: national Study on domestic violence findings

The Family Protection Act 2013 provides the legal framework for women to seek protection, security and justice from domestic violence. It protects all men, women and children who experience either physical, sexual, mental and economic violence in a domestic relationship. A Family Protection Advisory Council is established under the Act that overlooks the implementation of the Act. A Trust Fund is also established under the Act administered by the Ministry of Finance, which is available annually for CSOs to tap for providing services and facilities for victims/survivors of family violence.
A Family Protection Legal Aid 	figure 15: family Protection Legal Aid Center staff
Center was established in 2018 under the Ministry of Justice as a pilot project in Tonga under the support of the SPC/ RRRT aimed to provide better access to justice for victims/ survivors of family violence. During the pilot, 368 individuals were assisted and 268 deemed eligible for the Centre’s free legal assistance, with civil and criminal applications during the pilot were 90% by women for themselves or their children. As a result of its success, Government has agreed for the 
Centre to continue for another 
3 years with funding from SPC/ RRRT.
A Women Crisis Centre (WCC) a Non-Government Organization is committed to eliminating all forms of violence against women and children in Tonga.
figure 16: Women Crisis Centre

The policy on Women’s empowerment and gender equality for Tonga (WEGET) is the outcome of the review Tonga’s National policy on Gender and Development. With Tonga’s vision for Gender Equity by 2025, the WEGET policy contains five (5) priority outcomes covering gender mainstreaming in government policies, programs and services, corporate budgeting and monitoring and evaluation; domestic violence and Sexual Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR); women’s access to economic assets and employment; women’s participation in decision making and political representation; and gender response to natural disasters, environmental challenges and climate change. People with disabilities and vulnerable group are integral to these five priority outcomes. 
A Gender Mainstreaming Handbook (GMH) was developed in 2015 to support an enabling environment for mainstreaming gender across government policies, programs and services. The Handbook proposes entry points for mainstreaming gender through national governance and planning processes.
The Gender Equality Where Do We Stand (GEWDWS) Tonga is a statistical report which has recently been launched. It provides the most updated statistics disaggregated data by men, women, boys and girls on their social, economic and political opportunities, and participation. 
A national Service Delivery Protocol on Gender Based Violence will be completed this year, with an aim to map services for victims/survivors of violence, in order improve collaboration between service providers and raise effectiveness. 
boX 8: reaCH pilot
Following an outreach activity, a pastor’s wife for the Church of Tonga, said, “the pastor’s wife for the Church of Tonga, I feel empowered to initiate activities which will be sustainable for the future generation of our community. I strongly support that this REACH project continues in the future”.
(Kona’i Holeva Uasila’a, Petani, ‘Eua). The 	REACH 	(Rights, 	Empowerment 	and 
Cohesion) Project, commenced in 2019, with the goal to take government services and outreach to the remote and rural communities. Spearheaded by the Ministry of Internal Affairs – Women’s Affairs Division, five Ministries and Legal Aid Centre collaborated to provide joint services to sixteen villages (seven in the Eastern districts on the main island of Tongatapu, and nine on the island of ‘Eua). A total of 2,715 participants (1,695 women, 4 persons with disability and 1,016 men) benefitted from the services and information.
 SDG 10: Reduced inequalities
The economic institutions focus on how we create livelihoods, income, employment and business opportunities to generate economic growth. They relate to the ways we organize the ownership of the factors of production and engage in the production, distribution and marketing of goods and services. Traditionally this was substantially based on barter and extended exchange and often interacted with social obligations of reciprocity and sharing. Nowadays such arrangements are increasingly handled within a monetary-based system of exchange. However, significant non-monetary exchange relations continue to exist. Women’s groups play a particular important role in this area. While these nonmonetary exchanges contribute to our quality of life, they create challenges for the collection and analysis of economic data due to a large informal sector.
The way these institutions are arranged and the access they provide or restrict are critical to the type of growth that is possible and how inclusive it is. The essence of Tupou I’s reforms was to increase access to land resources so that his people would not suffer the lack of access to land and associated poverty. This was designed within a modified Tongan hierarchical structure. It is an integrated part of the economic, social, cultural and political network and is designed to support the social relations and reciprocity that are foundations of our traditional values and protection of all groups. When applied properly this system has many advantages for supporting inclusivity, although some aspects of its operation are being questioned. This is an area that will continue to be carefully debated.
With limited domestic resources and economies of scale, Tonga can increase opportunities for inclusive and sustainable development by actively engaging with neighbors in the Pacific and beyond. Experience around the world has shown that international trade is a major way of driving these opportunities. Access to overseas employment (both short term and long term) is another important opportunity given the limited economic opportunities within Tonga.
For instance, overseas seasonal workers program through an agreement between Government of Tonga and Governments of New Zealand and Australia that has seen employment opportunities provided to more than 20,000 Tongans since 2007. The seasonal workers’ program is focused on horticulture and viticulture industry has contributed immensely to the economic development of the country through remittances and provides employment improves income equally.  The scope of the seasonal programs has recently (since July 2018) expanded from horticulture and viticulture skills to include semi-skilled work, including in other sectors as care services carpentry and hospitality.

Tonga’s political and legal framework and how national and local administration operates is critical to all aspects of national development. Poor governance can worsen the consequences of the fragile environment, can undermine the delivery of services, and generally weaken progress to more sustainable and inclusive human development, and more dynamic economy. While much has been done in Tonga, much remains to be done to ensure accountable, transparent and responsible governance, from the application of law and order, to the management and performance of the public service. Improvements in these areas will strengthen overall progress, be particularly important for ensuring that services and support are delivered more fairly to all groups, ensure a sustainable use of resources and management of the environment.
SDG 16 in the context of TSDF II National Outcome D is briefly discussed below.
 SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions
There are several achievements worth noting in respect of efforts in Tonga to improve access to justice. For instance, 2018 saw significant appointments made to the judiciary. The first was the appointment of a female magistrate to the magistracy and the appointment of a Tongan Supreme Court Judge. These appointments have increased the number of judicial officers in both Courts thus increasing the ability of the Courts to handle its case load. In 2018, a Court building was reconstructed in the Ha’apai islands and a resident Magistrate for the Group reinstated. This has improved access to justice for the people of the Group. The Courts are working to address access to justice for disabled persons. Knowledge of Magistrates and Court staff on human rights issues has also been strengthened. 
 
figure 17: Judges of the Judiciary

With the assistance of the New Zealand Government, a Justice Sector Support Project has been operationalised to strengthen good governance and the rule of law. In particular, the project aims, inter alia, to: improve access to fair and effective justice increase capacity of Courts to effectively resolve disputes and improve services; make more accessible information on the legal system and legal rights; strengthen rehabilitation services for young offenders, and improve legal assistance by legal officers to clients. 
In collaboration with members of the National Coordinating Committee for Children, the Ministry of Justice supported the finalisation of the Kingdom of Tonga’s Initial Report on the Convention on the Rights of the Child mandated under Article 44 of the Convention. The Report was submitted in April 2018. There was extensive interaction with the Committee in respect of children’s involvement in activities under the auspices of SDG 16. This includes: (i) measures taken to harmonise legislation and the legislative definition of a child with that provided for in the Convention; (ii) special measures and general principles in respect of children within the criminal justice system; (iii) civil rights and freedoms, in particular on births and marriages as well as participation in decision making. The next step for Tonga is to await the response from the CRC on the report and to consider how the Committee’s concluding observations can inform and support proposals for policy and legislative reform in this area.
Consultations for the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Person’s with Disabilities, is currently underway. Consultations covered the whole of Tonga, and is steered by the National Disability Taskforce established in 2015. To support this, the first National Disability Survey was conducted in 2018 to identify the true figures of the number of people in Tonga with disabilities. 
boX 9: Vital statistics
A Civil Registry Vital Statistics Committee is important as it enables the line Ministries and Departments who use these vital statistics to: 
• provide documentary evidence and permanent record for people to establish their legal identity and prove civil status and family relationships; 
• protect and uphold variety of social, economic, cultural, political and human rights; facilitate access to essential services such as health care, education and social protection; enables political participation, property ownership, recourse to justice, formal employment, inheritance and the use of banking and financial services; and
• offers the basis for identity documents such as passport and National ID; and
• reduces the risk of human trafficking.To strengthen vital statistics, the National Civil Registry for Vital Statistics Committee (NCRVS) is actively enhancing data collection capacity of its members and to enable more effective information sharing practice amongst its members. Cooperation between line ministries and agencies is ongoing and effective in confirming and verifying of data. A standardized form for collecting data in line with international standards is needed to strengthen this cooperation and information sharing.
A number of gaps and opportunities remain, and potential measures in future could be considered, including: a national legal aid scheme to improve access to justice; a dedicated youth or juvenile justice system separate from the general criminal court, considering the increase in cases involving persons under the age of 21; a review on the Constitution of Tonga; strengthen capacity of judicial officers; improve court infrastructure; and strengthen court processes and management systems.
This national outcome is particularly costly to provide in a small-island state with dispersed communities, in particular, good economic infrastructure, access to energy, communication technologies and transport. Such infrastructure enables inclusive growth, foster human and business development. Appropriate infrastructure and technology also play a critical role in increasing resilience to current and future risks from the extreme natural events. As noted earlier, it is not possible to provide equal access to all inhabited islands, however, a minimum standard is aimed for as well as increasing attention to the requirements of groups with special needs. 
Technology and infrastructure interact with our human capacities to determine how natural resources and environment can be used in an inclusive and sustainable manner. The type of technology and infrastructure used and its placement has important consequences for supporting inclusive and sustainable institutions. This is particularly important in Tonga where many small communities are dispersed across many islands. If infrastructure is dispersed too widely, insufficient scale and linkages will exist to promote sustainable growth. On the other hand, if infrastructure is concentrated in one area to create growth hubs in the key centers, opportunities will be limited elsewhere. For example, airports cannot be provided on all islands, but jetties/wharfs are essential for trade and basic access by sea. Inclusive development thus requires a minimum standard of infrastructure. Technological change is opening up opportunities for supporting smaller Tongan communities in more cost-effective ways that enhance inclusion and participation. Examples include the provision of distance education and health services through new communications technology, and the development of smaller scale alternative energy systems.
Tonga is extremely vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change and disaster risks because of its geographical, geological and socio-economic features. The priority is thus to ensure that climate change and disaster risk management are better integrated into all aspects of development. This includes resilient infrastructure, more relevant policies, sound emergency plans and better forward thinking in all aspects of our development. Government dedicates priority to improve and maintain existing infrastructure as part of critical public goods for Tonga’s economic growth. These include main roads, agriculture roads, government offices, maintenance of hospitals, buildings and major assets to ensure good quality throughout their optimal economic life.
In terms of other development partners such as the World Bank, the funding envelope for the IDA18: 2017/18- 2019/20 of US$67.8 million focused in the areas of transport (USD$27.8 million), fisheries (USD$5 million), e-government (USD$5 million), youth employability (USD$15.0 million) and budget support (USD$15 million). Comparatively, this is an increase from a total of USD$19.2 million provided by World Bank in the previous triennium (IDA17: 2014/15 – 16/17). 
Similarly, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has increased (from USD$44.9 million to an average of USD$60 million) its funding envelope commencing 2018-2020 and focused in the areas of integrated urban resilience (USD$12 million), and renewable energy (USD$6.5 million), evacuation bridge to improve transport access (USD$20 million), budget support (USD$15.0 million). 
In terms of 2018/19 national budget allocation towards the infrastructure and technology pillar of TSDF II 2015-2025, received the highest allocation amounting to TOP$117.7million. More than 50 percent of this pillar comprises of energy efficiency projects and reconstruction of government buildings, schools and residential homes, improvement to water and sanitation structures and strengthening road structures. 
Steady migration from outer islands to the rural areas and urban centre on Tongatapu is driven by the reality of limited opportunities in small communities, and in turn has consequences for decisions on where to put new infrastructure to meet changing population pressures. The National Investment and Infrastructure Plan (NIIP), which is the sector plan for infrastructure development for the Government, outlines the Government of Tonga’s priorities and plans for major initiatives in economic infrastructure including energy, telecommunications, water, solid waste management, and transport. The NIIP contains specific criteria to help prioritize Tonga’s infrastructure needs. 

Tonga has experienced many examples of short-term growth based on the non-sustainable exploitation of renewable resources, which could have provided a steady future income stream if better managed. These have included both marine and land-based resources. Tonga is sensitive to severe natural events which are likely to become worse with ongoing climate change. It is imperative that resources are used in a sustainable manner and build-in greater resilience to extreme natural events and the dangers from climate change to achieve the TSDF II growth and development goals. 
Selected and relevant SDGs in the context of TSDF II National Outcome F are briefly discussed below.
 SDG 6: Clean water and sanitation
Seventy-nine of the one hundred and twenty-six Community Development Plans identified the need to establish rainwater storage capacities as their top priorities displaying the urgent need for clean and safe water. Tonga’s National Youth Congress (TNYC) and Tonga Community Development Trust (TCDT) are two civil society organizations that have been actively involved in advocating for clean and safe drinking water. This includes water purification, sanitation and hygiene training that enabled the distribution of water and hygiene kits to primary and secondary school children between the ages of 6 years to 10 years old and 11 years to 18 years old. Approximately 17,000 students were involved, with approximately 2,598 tons of water distributed. 
figure 18: tnYC Clean water for children As part of an overall strategy by Government of Tonga and donors towards climate change and drought impacts, a survey was conducted on current capacity for rainwater collection and future needs for freshwater in Ha’apai, Vava’u with their respective isolated but inhabited islands and also the Niuas group. Findings suggest 90% the population depend on rainwater for drinking in these remote islands. This finding influenced further program support, including through the TCDT effort to focus on repairing existing damaged cement water tanks and guttering. 
In terms of capacity building, a training manual on Sustainable Rainwater Harvesting (SRH) have been developed and adapted to local needs. Ongoing training has been conducted on SRH, targeting women participants and aimed at improving the understanding of rainwater collection methods, raising water quality standards and promoting the sustainable use of rainwater. 
Pacific Adaptation to Climate Change (PACC) is supporting 6 Tongan villages on improvement of water reticulation systems, installation of bore holes, pumps, and monitoring wells. 
As far as proportion of population using safely managed sanitation services and a hand- washing facility with soap and water, WASH Program was implemented with funding support from the Australian Government, SOPAC and European Union. The program targeted communities and schools in Tongatapu, Vava’u and Ha’apai, through raising awareness, provision of hand washing soaps and installed hand washing facilities in selected schools.
 SDG 7: Affordable and clean energy
Tonga recognizes that access to affordable, reliable and sustainable energy is crucial to achieving many of the Sustainable Development Goals. Access to energy, however, varies widely across the country.  
The Tonga Energy Road Map (TERM) is a government plan (2010-2020), which sets energy targets and supports implementation of SDG 7 indicators. Some key milestones include: the share of renewable energy has reached 10% with the target to reach 50% by 2020 still work-in-progress; and energy efficiency target, which is to reduce electricity network losses to 11% by 2020 from 30% in 2010, and is currently estimated at 13%. Tonga is expected to have 100% access to electricity for the end of 2020, with the current electrification rate close to 95%. The use of clean cooking such as LPG is 64% of total households.
boX 10: Climate Change Policy and JnaP focus areas
The Climate Change Policy established six areas of activity, which form the basis for the 
JNAP:
1. Mainstreaming;
2. Information, data, and research;
3. Resilience building response capability 
(capacity building);
4. Resilience building actions;
5. Finance; and
6. Regional and international cooperation.As a small developing country, Tonga is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change due to its geographical, geological and socio-economic characteristics. Of particular concern are the impacts due to: increasing sea level and associated coastal inundation and erosion; and increasing intensity of extreme weather events such as tropical cyclones. Such impacts severely affect the environment, the Tongan people and their livelihoods, as well as the national sustainable development ambitions. For instance, tropical Cyclone Gita, Category 5, caused widespread damage in February 2018, and basic public infrastructure, livelihoods and living facilities are still under reconstruction and recovery, as are the economy and natural resources. 
At the national level, climate change is integrated as one of the top 	figure 20: JnAP
priorities in the TSDF II. A revised Climate Change Policy was launched in 2016, to guide climate change actions towards building ‘a Resilient Tonga’ by 2035. The Climate Change Policy is intended to provide an overarching context and guiding framework with policy objectives that for the most part will require multi-sectoral coordination. Moreover, Tonga is recognized as the first country in the world, to develop an integrated plan (Joint National Action Plan on Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk Management (JNAP), to manage climate change and disaster risks instead of having two stand-alone plans. The JNAP guides the various mitigation and adaptation projects throughout Tonga, and is mainly supported through contributions from external donors and development partners. 
Oversight and implementation for climate change action has been institutionalized at various levels of government and the legislature, including through the Legislative Assembly Standing Committee for Climate Change. 
A Tonga Climate Change Trust Fund (CCTF) launched in February 2017, was initially endowed with an Asian Development Bank grant of USD$5 million, with USD$4million as Endowment Fund and $USD1million as Operational Fund. The purpose of the Fund is to support the climate resilience needs of the most vulnerable sectors and communities in Tonga through a small grants scheme to finance community adaptation projects. Two types of projects are considered un the Fund: small scale projects that require funding up to USD$50,000; and medium sized projects that require funding from USD$50,001 up to USD$250,000. In the first round of the CCTF funding, 33 projects were selected for funding, from a total 187 applications. A JNAP Taskforce is currently working on screening and shortlisting the applications from the second round of CCTF and successful adaption project proposals will be publicized in due course.
In the Eastern areas of Tongatapu Island, several villages were identified as very vulnerable to coastal erosion and inundation, with climate change and sea level rise expected to exacerbate vulnerabilities. Through an EU funded, Trialing Coastal Protection Measures in Eastern Tongatapu Project, different engineering methods were trialed in 2015, to protect coastal areas, including through the construction of offshore breakwaters, beach replenishment and coastal planting. These measures are expected to provide protection from storms and storm surges for nearly 4,000 people that reside in the adjacent coastal areas. These coastal protection measures provided a model for replication of activities to address similar coastal problems in Tonga and other Pacific countries.
To raise awareness, climate change figure 21: Visual guide on tonga Climate Change and disaster resilience information and knowledge products are publicly available through a national portal. Moreover, climate change aspects have been integrated into the primary and secondary school teaching and, where relevant, technical and vocational training, through the SPC/ GIZ Coping with Climate Change in the Pacific Island Region Program (CCCPIR). This Project also translated climate change and disaster management materials into the Tongan language and distributed to schools in Tonga. In partnership the Australian 
Government, TCDT worked closely with the Ministry of Education to prepare a manual and booklets for teaching climate change issues at primary school levels.
To build capacity, twenty Tongan students figure 22: tnYC Green team plastic campaign are currently undertaking studies (at Postgraduate Certificate and Diploma, Masters, PhD levels) at the University of the South Pacific on environment resilience, climate change and disaster risk management. TCDT, a civil society organization, has been involved in building the capacity of vulnerable communities in Tongatapu, Vava’u and Ha’apai, including on the value of evacuation centres when there is a natural disaster. The Tonga National Youth Congress (TNYC) has also actively been implementing projects, including through: awareness camps; youth green dialogues; development of a green code of conduct; outreach activities at primary schools; and no plastic campaign which has attracted more than 500 members across Tonga. 
 SDG 14: Ocean management
The Government continues to implement necessary measures to conserve and ensure sustainable use of marine and land resources through the prudent management of fishing licenses, fishing efforts, environmental impacts and land uses. Tonga’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) has a total area of about 700,000 km². There have been 38 species identified under pelagic fish to be found at both deep sea and coastal zone. Also recorded were 12 species of whales and six species of marine turtles. Humpback whales and bottlenose whales are considered endangered and together with hawksbill turtles are all protected under Tongan legislation. 
The following are selected initiatives aimed to sustainably manage coastal and marine resources:
• Tonga Fisheries Sector Plan (TFSP) was approved in 2016, following a comprehensive review of the fisheries sector. The sector plan was prepared with the support of the World Bank and includes four strategic areas: sustainable community fisheries; commercial fisheries and aquaculture; public and private investment (including infrastructure and facilities); and good governance and capacity building;
• An associated National Fisheries Policy formally announced in December 2018. As a result, World Bank granted USD 10 million to support funding of TFSP implementation through the Pathway to Sustainable Oceans (Tongafish Pathway) over 6 years starting in July 2019, and focused in the four areas outlined in Box 11;  
• An Ocean Planning and Management Bill is currently being drafted to provide an effective foundation for comprehensive marine spatial planning; 
boX 11: four components of the tongafish Pathway project
Component 1: Strengthening fisheries governance. 
Component 2: Strengthened knowledge base for fisheries and aquaculture.
Component 3: Investing in sustainable fisheries management and development.
Component 4: Supporting effective project management.Preparation of a national Marine Spatial Plan (MSP) covering the entire EEZ to ecologically sustain social and economic development of ocean resources for the benefit of all Tongans, by facilitating the conservation of biodiversity; minimization of conflicts between users; and managing use of resources. In particular, a MSP will help designate around 30% of Tonga’s EEZ as Marine Protected Areas pursuant to SDG 14 targets; 
• A draft National Maritime Compliance Framework is being prepared to strengthen the compliance and enforcement implementation capacity of maritime stakeholders;
boX 12: smas for fishing
40 SMA had been established in various communities in. Tonga, and by 2020, 50 
SMAs in total are targeted to be established. • Special Management Areas (SMA) for fishing have been established, with the goal to protect and manage the coastal marine resources from depleting and to encourage the community to collectively eradicate overfishing. The SMA’s empower 
	the coastal communities to manage the 	figure 23: SmA boundary
fisheries and the marine spaces, including through enforcement to exclude outsiders from entering an SMAs; establishment of marine parks; and implementation of restrictions on harvested resources, including, size limits and catch amounts. A specific area within the SMA is also designated for Fish Habitat Reserve (FHR) or (no take zones). The importance of FHR is mainly for monitoring and evaluation of 
the status of marine resources within, and to protect different fish habitats as well as different marine organisms. Figure 23 shows an example of the SMA boundary - the yellow line indicates the end boundary for SMA and red line indicates the end boundary for FHR; and
• Tonga’s National Biodiversity Strategy Framework (NBSF) also provides a legal and institutional framework to govern the conservation and management of marine and coastal ecosystems.
 SDG 15: Land management
Land management systems in figure 24: Duke of Sussex’s visit to the tupou College Tonga incorporates traditional rainforest, which is part of the Queen’s Commonwealth Canopy hierarchical values through which each male aged 16 is entitled to 8.25 acres of land. This has had serious implications causing the land shortage and constrains government’s ability to actively plan the use of land. Land use in Tonga is generally known to be indigenous habitats, housing, agriculture and forestry. However, the native forest areas have been reduced to only a small site in Tupou College Toloa on the main island Tongatapu.
Waste management practices also impact on land use. There is no sewage reticulation system in the urban areas and poorly maintained septic tanks leak effluent to the groundwater system. A Waste Authority Limited is responsible for collecting waste and disposal at the Tapuhia landfill. However, lack of resources results in solid waste not being sorted at the landfill. The landfill infrastructure and proper waste collection practices needs to be extended to outer islands in Tonga. Moreover, no appropriate place for disposal of hazardous waste exists, which poses serious risks. 
Invasive plants also pose a threat to land use, and through Tonga’s National Invasive Species Strategy and Action Plan several initiatives are underway to prevent and control invasive species.
The TSDF II National Outcome G, promotes more inclusive and sustainable and consistent advancement of Tonga’s external interests, security and sovereignty.  It underscores the need for development partnerships and open economy. As outlined earlier, while significant progress has been made in implementing TSDF II 2015-2025 and SDG priorities, Tonga continues to face challenges in accessing the necessary means to accelerate implementation.
 SDG 17: Means of implementation
Critical analysis of the progress made indicates that gaps, constraints and opportunities remain in key means of implementation, namely: financing; human capacity; national systems and coordinated processes; statistics; and partnerships. In all these areas, specific measures have been put in place. However, given the reform nature of these measures, some lag time is expected in achieving results, and the pace of changes introduced need to be cognizant of the absorptive capacities, and ground realities. Furthermore, gap in financing requirements remain significant, despite efforts to mobilize public funds including through debt financing.  At the same time, opportunities remain, and further initiatives are necessary to accelerate progress. Specific measures have been identified in the progress section of this Report, and thematic issues are discussed below. 
On financing for development, a primary challenge remains unpredictable and devasting natural disaster events which set back years of progress and requires that public finances be rediverted to urgent recovery and rehabilitation efforts at the expense of broader development initiatives. For instance, in 2018 widespread destruction was caused by a Category 5 Cyclone, the strongest in Tonga’s history, resulting in impacts, assessed at an economic value of about 30% of GDP in nominal terms. Climate adaption actions largely depend on projects that are funded by external donors. At present insufficient flows of development aid is available for the necessary climate proofing investments. Improved access to, and management of, climate finances will help with investments needed to strengthen Tonga’s infrastructure and environmental resilience. 
In addition, additional domestic revenue measures and reforms are needed to complement development initiatives such as imposition of excise taxes on alcohol, tobacco and low nutrition goods to promote healthy lifestyles for Tongans. Such revenue measures are critical considering the limited fiscal space and room for external borrowing given the existing high debt levels. A sizeable share of foreign currency debt in the borrowing portfolio, leaves Tonga highly vulnerable to unfavorable exchange rate movements. 
Together with stable and predictable flows of bilateral and multilateral partners funds will be essential in the medium-term to invest in national development priorities, and relevant SDGs. The considerable assistance afforded to Tonga is acknowledged, however, additional support is needed to cover the remaining gap. The total development budget provided through external development partner funding comprises about 47% the Government’s total budget for 2019/20. More so, a more comprehensive and coordinated strategy for technical assistance is needed help with strengthening absorptive capacity. Deepening partnerships and improved development effectiveness can be enabled by reforming current aid management systems and mechanisms to monitor and coordinate external aid. To this end, a national policy on development aid and partnerships, together with funding and technical assistance to design a functional aid management system is required. It’s imperative that such a policy clearly defines roles of various Ministries, including that of a lead coordination agency, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the implementation and monitoring lead, the Ministry of Finance. Durable partnerships need further harnessing with civil society and community stakeholders to leverage all resources and allow for collective action. 
Human capacity and institutional strengthening require further support to raise productivity and efficiencies for service delivery. Several initiatives are underway to strengthen national (and sector) planning and budgeting systems, which are critical to translate plans to results. In addition, adopting whole-of-government approaches for coordinated and coherent service delivery continues to be a priority.
 
boX 13: national strategy for the development of statistics 2019-2023
Tonga has launched its National Strategy for the Development of Statistics (NSDS) 2019 - 2023 with a mission “to provide user-friendly access to quality statistics, informing policy development and planning, mindful of Tonga’s development aspirations, and acknowledging international best practices, local knowledge and culture”. The Tongan Government recognizes that quality statistical data is key to forming, refining and monitoring relevant policies. The strategic objectives of the NSDS including the following: 1) Statistical Legislation and Policy; 2) Communication, Access and Use; 3) Data and Information Management; 4) Tonga NSS Coordination and 5) Resource development. 
Tonga has the Statistical Act of 2015 that is in compliance with the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics. Government of Tonga has allocated $1million through the annual budget allocation to the Department of Statistics to fund Census which is done every 5 years as well as other relevant surveys. This commitment indicate the value placed on quality data. 
Current gaps (see Annex A) in statistics for monitoring and measuring TSDF II and global indicators will be progressively developed.
For informing policy and improved measurability of progress and effective monitoring and reporting, plans are in place for expanding the range of available statistics and improving reliability. Additionally, with tailored and measurable indicators for national and sector plans and budgets, reporting on implementation efforts for both national processes and external purposes will be more systematic and effective. An ongoing challenge for Tonga is the disaggregation of all data sets. In this vein, Tonga Statistics Department has developed some innovative approaches. For instance, usage of the ‘small area estimation’ technique to disaggregate information not just on main island and all rural islands together but to disaggregate information by villages, districts, constituencies, and separate island divisions that was not available in the previous sampling design. As an example, the multi-dimensional poverty report had been disaggregated according to these lower geographical locations, which can better inform targeted policy interventions for these marginalized groups. Further, those often left behind, for example the people with disability, is a target sub-group of the population that the Tonga Statistics Department worked collaboratively with the Washington Group on Disability Statistics, established under the UN Statistical Commission. This multi-stakeholder group has developed a range of disability data tools which have been selectively tested extensively in Tonga’s context, and added to ongoing data collections thus providing an efficient approach to monitor implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the SDGs by disaggregating data by disability status.

NEXT STEPS
 
Based on the findings of the VNR, Tongan stakeholders have identified a number of issues to consider to improve implementation outcomes and delivery of development priorities. The core of the issues is focused on the need to continue with reforms aimed to strengthen: national planning systems; decision making processes; whole-of-government approaches; participatory involvement of civil society; efficiency in development cooperation; improved evidence and statistics for policy; and accountable leadership and governance. 
Some specific considerations include:
 	Strengthen coordination on statistical systems.
• Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics, promotes integrated measurement frameworks to improve the efficient and effective production and dissemination of quality SDG data and statistics, facilitates collaboration and enhances the technical and statistical skills of professional staff to address human resource needs.  This also means leveraging the whole statistical system (not just the national statistics office) to ensure that limited capacities are coordinated to deliver data and statistics needed for policy.
• User and producer collaboration to fully utlise data and statistical information for informing policy.
• Improve data collection, analysis and synchronization of disaggregated data to provide a representative image on the impact of policy.
 	Strengthen development aid coordination. 
• In support of the principle of aid effectiveness, develop a national development aid policy and associated institutional mechanism to support improved coordination.
• Establish an aid information management system for effective coordination of development partner programs in Tonga. 
 	Strengthen the national monitoring and evaluation systems. 
• Ensure Monitoring and Evaluation systems are effective in evaluating the impact of all initiatives.
• Promote the culture of evidence-based practice by empowering locally driven research to identify what are the barriers and facilitating factors that can address development challenges and inform evaluation of policy initiatives.
• To raise demand for accountability and improve the broader use of monitoring reports, disseminate information to the community, and CSO stakeholders. 
• Strengthen partnerships between CSO and Government.
• Strengthen the coordination of national, regional and international commitments to reduce duplication and improve efficiency – however ensuring that initiatives are high-impact, contextualized and appropriate.
• Strengthen multi-sector engagement.
• Promote community engagement and feedback on initiatives.
 	Closer engagement with the private sector and CSOs to increase coverage, improve collaboration and have robust service delivery.
 	Leadership and governance.
 	Establish/operationalize robust and predictable guidance and leadership for implementation of development priorities at all levels, including political, churches, CSOs, communities, and development partners.
 	Improve levels of accountability and oversight for better governance, through relevant institutions, and national stakeholders, including the media, and CSOs.
These measures will be progressively considered in line with TSDF II implementation measures to ensure the best possible development results in Tonga’s context.
