DATA MONITORING AND REPORTING
The Government of Jamaica recognizes the importance of data and statistics and continues to make strides in expanding and improving the quality and quantity of data for national decision-making, planning and policy formulation as well as guidance for the success of the new development agenda. National consultations were undertaken in March 2016, to assess the feasibility, suitability, relevance and availability of data for the monitoring of the SDGs. The results revealed that Jamaica can currently produce only 66 of the SDGs indicators. Through STATIN, there is an ongoing process to address the gaps with support from bilateral, multilateral and other partnerships to develop a Data Quality Assurance Framework, to amend the
JAMAICA VOLUNTARY NATIONAL REVIEW REPORT
National Statistics Act and establish the National Statistics Commission. Jamaicais engagement as a regional representative on the Inter-Agency Expert Group on SDGs Indicators (IAEG-SDGS) provides for continued advocacy for enhanced support for the data monitoring systems in the region.
  The Monitoring and Evaluation Framework for the SDGs in Jamaica includes the MTF, the Whole-of-Government Business Plan, the Operational and Corporate Plans of government Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) and the SDGs Indicators Framework System. 
PARTNERSHIPS
Several key national priorities are operationalized and implemented under the leadership of the Government through bilateral, regional and multilateral partnerships with international development partners, private sector, civil society, community groups and diasporic organizations. The achievement of Vision 2030 Jamaica and the SDGs calls for mobilising the collective strength of all partners to undertake new and innovative approaches to capitalize on national and global opportunities, and address the challenges. Jamaica co-chairs with Canada the Group of Friends for SDGs Financing (GoF) initiative that convenes Member States, private sector, and other partners in dialogue and considers ways to scale up financing for the implementation of the SDGs.
INCLUSIVENESS AND STAKEHOLDER PARTICIPATION
An effective communication and public education campaign to increase the level of awareness of all stakeholders and to develop partnerships around the importance of the SDGs and its alignment with Vision 2030 Jamaica, has resulted in the preparation of a Communication and Advocacy Roadmap 2018n2021. The process of sensitization on the SDGs and consultation on the VNR began in 2017 with an approach to \0xECLocalise the SDGs, through the Dialogue for Development series under the theme \0xECThe Jamaica We Want: Vision 2030 Jamaica, advancing the SDGs\0xD6 Leaving no one behind engaging children and youth, farmers, fisherfolk, business community, persons with disabilities, women and grassroots organizations, service organizations, local level authorities, and parliamentarians. In addition, the Vision 2030 Jamaica Secretariat undertook extensive consultations to define the national priorities for the MTF 2018n2021 to ensure further alignment with the SDGs.
DEVELOPMENT RESULTS AND PRIORITIES 
Jamaica is progressively developing and implementing a whole-of-society approach that recognizes inter-sectoral linkages, partnerships and mechanisms for the holistic
HIGHLIGHTS
and integrated implementation of the three dimensions of sustainable development (social, economic and environment). Development results for the MTF 2015n2018, measured in accordance with these three dimensions, revealed that Jamaica has maintained a high human development rank; in the 2016 Human Development Report, Jamaica was ranked 94 out of 188 countries. In the area of social development, major gains have been made in life expectancy, child mortality, education outcomes; however, issues such as poverty and the effects of noncommunicable diseases have lagged behind. Priority focus has been placed on the revision, formulation and implementation of several critical social policies and strategies to address the changing demographics in the areas of population, youth, senior citizens, international migration, poverty and social protection.
  As part of the efforts to regain macroeconomic stability and a stable path to development, the Economic Reform Programme (ERP) was designed to include inter alia the reduction of the national debt burden, promotion of fiscal discipline, increase revenues and advance key reforms in the public sector. 
  As part of resilience building efforts, the policy, planning and legislative frameworks relating to the environment and climate change were strengthened. These included the promulgation of the Climate Change Policy Framework for
Jamaica (2015); the Forest Policy for Jamaica, 2017; the Disaster Risk Management Act, 2015; the Fishing Industry (Amendment) Act, 2015; and the Coastal Management and Beach Restoration Guidelines. Several initiatives were also implemented which improved climate smart agricultural practices, availability of disaster risk management and climate-related data to support decision-making and early warning systems, as well as facilitating the provision of financial mechanisms to support resilience building of MSMEs and non-governmental and communitybased organizations. Jamaica ratified the Paris Agreement and advanced work on carbon stock monitoring, including sequestration in forests.
  The priorities for the new MTF 2018n2021 period are outlined under the goals of Vision 2030 Jamaica. (See figure 2 on page xi)
CHALLENGES
The main challenge for Jamaica is implementing policies that will trigger fast and sustained progress towards the goals in a context of limited fiscal space. The aim of Vision 2030 Jamaica and the SDGs require the prioritization of catalytic actions that can drive progress across multiple goals and targets simultaneously. There is need to establish mechanisms for the sustainable financing of national development priorities, including the implementation of priorities aligned with the SDGs. 
  Several related challenges remain, primarily triggered by the countryis vulnerabilities to internal and external shocks. These vulnerabilities include the
JAMAICA VOLUNTARY NATIONAL REVIEW REPORT

impact of natural disasters and the negative effects of climate change; migration; non-tariff barriers to trade; and high levels of indebtedness which have constrained efforts towards sustainable development.
NEXT STEPS
As Jamaica seeks to accelerate implementation of the 2030 Agenda, particular focus will be placed on the following:
\0xEF Full and effective implementation of national priorities outlined in the MTF 2018n2021 to address the challenges \0xF3 social, economic, environment and governance
\0xEF Strengthen the National Statistics System 
\0xEF Improve the monitoring and evaluation framework 
\0xEF Explore and identify mechanisms and strategies for financing the implementation of the SDGs within the context of the current fiscal constraints
\0xEF Improve policy coherence and build capacity in the area of policy integration to strengthen capacities of national policy makers to use goal-oriented, evidencebased, and participatory frameworks to formulate, implement and review integrated policies and strategies for sustainable development.
\0xEF Ongoing SDGs Communication and public engagement.
HIGHLIGHTS
Introduction
mplementation of the SDGs has been integrated into Jamaicais first long-term national development plan (Vision 2030 Jamaica) which covers the period 2009n
  2030. The plan presents a strategic roadmap for Jamaica to achieve developed country status by 2030; and is now in its 10th year of implementation. Vision 2030 Jamaica is grounded in the premise that national development will be sustainable and inclusive, engaging all Jamaicans in the planning, designing and implementation processes and providing equitable opportunities for all Jamaicans to benefit. Vision 2030 Jamaica is built on a results-based management framework, comprising 4 goals, 15 national outcomes and a strategic and operational framework geared towards the achievement of the goals and outcomes to ensure that \0xECno-one is leTh behind. The achievement of the goals and outcomes is embodied in the National Vision Statement \0xECJamaica, the place of choice to live, work, raise families and do business.

Figure 3: 4 National Goals and 15 National Outcomes of Vision 2030 Jamaica
  Vision 2030 Jamaica represents an integration of the three dimensions of sustainability, underpinned by the core principles of sustainable development and inclusive growth, equity and good governance. Another central guiding principle of the plan is people-centeredness. The achievement of the goals and outcomes is designed to improve the lives of all people and provide them with opportunities to achieve their fullest potential as change agents and beneficiaries in achieving social security, economic prosperity and safeguarding the planet.

Figure 4: Key Facts Underpinning Vision 2030 Jamaica
  To realise \0xECThe Jamaica We Want: Vision 2030 Jamaica, advancing the SDGs\0xD6 Leaving No One Behind the MTF is the mechanism for planning, reviewing and monitoring of the implementation of Vision 2030 Jamaica. Each MTF comprises a medium-term strategic programme to advance the implementation of the National Development Plan, based on the nationis development aspirations and guiding principles as articulated in the plan. The Government of Jamaica recognizes that there is a high level of coherence between the SDGs and other international platforms such as the SAMOA Pathway for Small Island Developing States (SIDS), Sendai Framework, Addis Ababa Action Agenda, the New Urban Agenda, and the Paris
Agreement. The synchronization of these platforms provides the opportunity to build into the national development planning framework greater focus on policy coherence across different but overlapping areas. The relevance of this for Jamaica is stark, as the country manages its efforts to build resilience while navigating particular vulnerabilities and external economic shocks which can hamper the countryis development trajectory. 
INTRODUCTION
  The preparation of the Voluntary National Review (VNR) for Jamaica presents an opportunity to take stock of the processes, structures, policies and multi-stakeholder participation in the implementation of national development priorities. The report is being framed in the context of the formulation of the 4th successive MTF for the period 2018n2021 and provides an assessment of the countryis performance in localising and mainstreaming the SDGs, including the capacity for monitoring and reporting.
JAMAICA VOLUNTARY NATIONAL REVIEW REPORT
Methodology andof ReviewProcess for Preparation
J
amaica has a well-established tradition of designing solutions to issues of development through participatory governance. This is evident in the whole-ofsociety approach to the national development planning process. Preparation of the VNR was no different as a major feature of the planning process is the high level of engagement of all stakeholders including NGOs, CSOs, private sector, academia, philanthropic organizations, international development partners and all sub-groups of the population (women, children, youth, older persons, persons with disabilities etc.). The process of sensitization regarding the SDGs and consultation on the VNR began in July 2017 with the view to \0xECLocalise the SDGs. 
  Members of the National 2030 Agenda SDGs Core Group benefited from the UNITAR course on \0xECStrengthening stakeholder engagement for the implementation and review of the 2030 Agenda. The course provided Jamaica with a solid framework for its engagement strategy for the VNR consultations and deeper levels of participatory engagement on the SDGs. The approach for engagement on the VNR was two-fold:
\0xEF Stakeholder consultations and sessions specific for local authorities, private sector, academia, civil society and the general public to facilitate feedback and buy-in. This approach sought to delve into the role of stakeholders in realizing the SDGs and to identify development priorities.
\0xEF Sector MDAs were consulted on the 17 SDGs to assess the policies, processes, institutional arrangements and progress made, including best practices and challenges.
  Jamaica recognizes the importance of an effective communication and public education campaign to increase the level of awareness of all stakeholders and to develop partnerships around the SDGs and its alignment with Vision 2030 Jamaica. The main platform for engaging the public on the SDGs was through the 2017 staging of the Dialogue for Development Series over the period October to December, which focused on the theme \0xECThe Jamaica We Want: Vision 2030 Jamaica advancing the SDGs . . . Leaving no one behind. The series concluded with the launch of the national SDGs public education campaign by the Prime Minister. Overall, the campaign deepened interaction between government and the people to set a platform to achieve the principles and objectives of the SDGs and Vision 2030 Jamaica through new and traditional media. Social media engagement for the SDGs was critical for reaching out to the public and creating awareness. Postings were made through Facebook pages of PIOJ, Vision 2030 Jamaica, the Jamaica Information Service and UN Jamaica around events, issues and consultations on the SDGs. A SDGs promotional video was created for circulation on social media to further sensitize Jamaicans about the SDGs and presenting a call to action for Jamaicans to achieve Vision 2030 Jamaica and the SDGs. Stakeholders were also engaged through exhibitions, promotional events, community outreach programmes, billboards and radio interviews.
  In addition to the series, some 42 sector specific and subnational consultations were convened with technical specialists from MDAs, farmers, fisherfolk, children and youth, the business community, persons with disabilities, grassroots organizations, community-based organizations and local government authorities in urban and rural settings. Some 42 consultations were held engaging approximately 2 000 persons and 50 prioritization sessions for the 4th MTF 2018n2021 with over 480 stakeholders were convened between January and May 2018 through the Thematic Working Groups of Vision 2030 Jamaica. These meetings were also used to inform the VNR process to take stock of the performance over the period 2015n 2018 and determine the national priorities to be pursued for 2018n2021.

JAMAICA VOLUNTARY NATIONAL REVIEW REPORT
  Engagement with the public on the SDGS is an ongoing process. With support from UNDP, a SDGs Communications and Advocacy Roadmap 2019n2022 was developed. Recognizing the need to scale-up advocacy and communications efforts around Vision 2030 Jamaica and the SDGs, the Roadmap outlines a mix of strategies to increase awareness and the foster ownership. Three major initiatives scheduled for 2018 are:
\0xEF Partnership with the Jamaica Library Service (JLS) through its network of 119 fixed library locations, 373 mobile library stops and 901 schools to deepen the understanding about the SDGs and Vision 2030 Jamaica through ICT access points in rural and urban communities, as well as those with limited or no access.
\0xEF Partnership with the UNCT to host the island-wide SDGs Roadshow designed to create awareness and build solidarity across the entire population.
\0xEF Identification of SDGs Champions who will promote and advocate for the SDGs.
METHODOLOGY AND PROCESS FOR PREPARATION OF REVIEW
Policy and EnablingEnvironment
CREATING OWNERSHIP OF THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS
he whole-of-society approach embraced by Jamaica is a testament to the efforts to ensure the fulfilment of the principle of an inclusive and participatory approach to the SDGs. Political commitment to the SDGs process is integral to its success. Building on the bipartisan support of Vision 2030 Jamaica and the MTF, commitment for the SDGs spans both political parties and transcends beyond electoral cycles. Stakeholder participation and local involvement have been critical to the national development process. The Government of Jamaica recognizes that the success of the SDGs is hinged on the partnership and cooperation of all stakeholders. Jamaicais commitment to democratic governance in the national development planning and implementation process is highlighted through utilization of stakeholder engagements and a people-centred approach. The MTF is the planning mechanism within the national framework designed to facilitate the identification of priorities aligned with the requisite action and resources. Local level implementation of the SDGs is paramount to ensure that the principle of leaving no one behind is achieved. Monitoring, reporting and evaluation of the implementation of the SDGs require robust data and statistical systems to inform evidence-based decision-making and planning. The consultation process for the VNR has further highlighted that policy coherence requires strengthening to ensure the promotion of integration and coordination in its policies, processes and mechanisms.
Since 2014, during the intergovernmental negotiations for the Post-2015
Development Agenda, the Government of Jamaica began engaging, through national and sector specific consultations, with all stakeholders and major groups to highlight the countryis development priorities within this new framework and to engender national ownership. In this regard, a National Outcome Document on the Post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals was developed to set the framework for the alignment of Vision 2030 Jamaica and the SDGs.

A Rapid Integration Assessment (RIA) and Mainstreaming, Acceleration and
Policy Support (MAPS) Mission was conducted through the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The analysis showed that of the 115 SDGs targets deemed relevant for Jamaica, 105 (or 91.3 per cent) were fully or partially aligned. The main gaps identified by the assessment were in the Planet and Partnership pillars. SDG Goal 17 (Partnership for the Goals) has only 50.0 per cent of relevant targets aligned. Goal 14 (Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development) has three out of seven targets addressed.

Box 1: Overview of Implementation of the 2030 Agenda 
\0xECThe implementation of the 2030 Agenda will require integrated approaches to coordinate and design sustainable development policies that generate wins on social, economic and environmental fronts while minimizing negative impacts from trade-offs. The challenges faced by Jamaica in implementation of the SDGs are complex, including a tight fiscal space and low economic growth. Yet, the opportunities to overcome these obstacles are also large if Jamaica fosters multi-stakeholder engagement to create and implement stronger and more coherent policies. The vision of Jamaica, as outlined in Vision 2030 Jamaica, serves as an axis around which efforts to implement the 2030 Agenda will be organized.
  One important outcome of the MAPS mission was the formulation of a Roadmap for SDGs Implementation in Jamaica approved by the Cabinet in June 2017. It articulates alignment of the SDGs with national priorities as well as the institutional coordination mechanism that will support implementation. This alignment indicates that both Vision 2030 Jamaica and the SDGs can and will deliver the same development results and ultimately, all will work to achieve the same goals and outcomes for the Jamaican people.
  The Roadmap identified the MTF as the primary mechanism for monitoring the implementation of Vision 2030 Jamaica and accordingly the SDGs. Jamaicais continued pursuit and implementation of the goals, outcomes and strategic framework of Vision 2030 Jamaica, through the MTF process, would largely lead to the achievement of the SDGs goals and targets relevant to Jamaica. The roadmap proposed accelerators to be considered for each of the four national goals of Vision 2030 Jamaica; the financing needs; data requirements for monitoring and reporting; and public outreach actions to ensure \0xECno one is leTh behind.

Figure 7: Common Features of the SDGs and Vision 2030 Jamaica 
  Several existing and new mechanisms are being utilised to drive the national sustainable development agenda and raise awareness of the link between Vision 2030 Jamaica and the SDGs through:
\0xEF Thematic Working Groups of Vision 2030 Jamaica and specific sector committees
\0xEF Partnership arrangements with the private sector and civil society organizations n through which many have initiated and implemented projects to support the achievement of the SDGs 
\0xEF Increasing awareness among youth n engagement with Youth Parliamentarians, Ambassadors and Leaders to create SDG champions who are well-informed and able to articulate and share experience on the SDGs to the youth population
\0xEF A coordination mechanism for Government and its International Development Partners to discuss Vision 2030 Jamaica and SDGs Financing and Implementation. 
  Several tertiary level institutions have sought to incorporate the SDGs in their curricula recognizing the critical role education plays in shaping the knowledge, skills, values and attitudes to support sustainable development, as well as a key determinant for social and economic transformation. Tertiary institutions continue to infuse the assessment and analysis of sustainable development concepts in the areas of teaching, research and university-community engagement activities. 
Box 2: Academic Integration
The Sir Arthur Lewis Institute for Social and Economic Studies (SALISES), UWI administers core courses in the areas of Development Studies, research methodology and monitoring and evaluation.  The University of the West Indies has partnered with government, UNDP and other partners to bring attention to the SDGs at the national and regional levels through convening the Caribbean Action 2030 Regional Conference on the SDGs in June 2017 and the SALISES Conference on \0xECSustainable Futures for the Caribbean: Critical Interventions and the 2030 Agenda, April 2018. The 2016/2017 cohort of SALISES MSc students in Development Studies conducted a study on Community-Based Approaches to Assessing and Measuring the SDGs, exploring the development context of a rural farming community and the process of localizing the SDGs.
The University of Technology, Jamaica through the Faculty of Science and Sport will host a conference in July 2018 on the theme \0xECAccomplishing the UNs Sustainable Development Goals through Science, Technology and Innovation.
  As the Supreme Audit Institution, Jamaicais Auditor Generalis Department has undertaken a performance audit of the countryis preparedness for implementation of the SDGs. The audit seeks to ascertain: 
\0xEF Functional coordinating and institutional arrangements which allow for proper oversight of the 2030 Agenda 
\0xEF Level of prioritization and allocation of requisite resources towards the major interventions to accelerate the delivery of the SDGs
\0xEF Level of engagements of the relevant stakeholders and established mechanisms to raise awareness
\0xEF Established mechanisms to monitor and report on the progress of the goals 
\0xEF Previously established arrangements in respect of Vision 2030 that will aid or impede the preparedness for the implementation of the SDGs.
The results of the audit will be made available by the final quarter of 2018.
INCORPORATION OF THE SDGS IN NATIONAL FRAMEWORKS
Since the adoption of the SDGs in September 2015, the Government of Jamaica has strategically and deliberately made effort to localize and mainstream the SDGs in its national policies and planning frameworks. Jamaica has utilised existing mechanisms to anchor this process through continued engagement with stakeholders including CSOs and the private sector on their contribution to the implementation of the SDGs. (See Table 2 on page 11).
THE MEDIUM TERM SOCIO-ECONOMIC POLICY FRAMEWORK
The MTF is the main mechanism for the implementation of Vision 2030 Jamaica. It comprises the framework for medium-term implementation, translating the strategic roadmap of Vision 2030 Jamaica and its core and guiding principles into actionable priorities to which all partners in national and local level development can align, including state and non-state actors. The MTF is implemented in 3-year planning cycles commencing in 2009 and ending in 2030. Three MTFs have been implemented since 2009, covering the periods 2009n2012, 2012n2015, 2015n2018. The 4th MTF will cover the period 2018n 2021. It serves as the central frame of reference and pivot for medium term development prioritization regarding the pursuit of development initiatives, resource allocation and monitoring of development progress towards the long-term 2030 goals. 
  Linkages are evident across all sectors of government and development stakeholders. The Whole-of-Government Business Plan; and Corporate and

Operational Plans are aligned with the MTF. Private sector, civil society and academia are also required to align with the MTF to ensure coherence between state action and that of key national interests. International Development Partners (IDPs) have aligned their country programmes with the MTF and the United Nations Country Team (UNCT) has committed to the alignment of the annual Country Implementation Plan (CIP) of the Multi-Country Sustainable Development Framework (MSDF) for the 18 English and Dutch speaking Caribbean, with Vision 2030 Jamaica and the MTF. 
LOCAL SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT PLANS
A local governance mechanism for sustainable development planning forms a key part of the successful implementation of Vision 2030 Jamaica and the SDGs. Local Sustainable Development Plans (LSDPs) provide an important mechanism for localizing the SDGs. Five1 of the fourteen Municipal Corporations have developed LSDPs and preparation of the remaining LSDPs will commence by 2019. While not all parishes have a developed LSDP, it should be noted that local development planning is evident at the parish and community levels. Challenges, however, remain in areas of coordination and institutionalization of processes, and alignment of

Figure 9: National Development Planning Framework
national and local level planning. These processes at the local level reflect existing and new partnerships which provide platforms to enhance the implementation process and work towards achievement of the SDGs. Through a partnership with the European Commission (EC), the Commonwealth Local Government Forum (CLGF) is supporting the localization and implementation of the LSDPs under the project \0xECStrengthening local governmentis role as a partner in development.
SUSTAINABLE FINANCING FOR NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
Sustainable financing for achieving the SDGs has been an ongoing discussion and was highlighted in the Roadmap for SDGs Implementation in Jamaica. Of particular importance is access to funding and budget availability at all levels of the planning and implementation processes related to the SDGs. Financing is one of the main challenges for the full implementation of the SDGs and arising from the SDGs Roadmap for Implementation proposals were made to address the financing of the SDGs Agenda in Jamaica from resources derived from both the public and private sector. The need to improve access to financing options is particularly acute in the case of Jamaica due to its classification as an upper middle income country (UMIC).
  In this regard, a critical arm of the national planning process to address performance-based budgeting is the Public Investment Management System (PIMS) which aims to streamline the preparation, appraisal, approval and management of all Government projects in Jamaica, regardless of the source of funding, the type of procurement or implementation method used. It will enhance the efficiency of the projects which are implemented by the Government of Jamaica. The PIMS will ensure that the Government receives value for money, and over time, sustained economic growth and development from each project that is implemented. The Public Investment Management Secretariat (PIMSEC) plays a critical role in budgeting and prioritizing the funding for the SDGs. 
INTEGRATION OF THE THREE DIMENSIONS
The implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the achievement of the 17 SDGs require the integration of the three dimensions of sustainability in development planning and implementation. It also requires a critical appreciation of the relationships between the three dimensions in monitoring and evaluation and evidence-based practice. As part of Jamaicais commitment to integrate the 2030 Agenda in national development planning and implementation, focus is placed on the alignment of the priorities being pursued in the MTF with relevant SDGs and targets, and the core principle of \0xECleaving no one behind. 
  The institutional framework, which includes multi-stakeholder Thematic Working Groups (TWGs) as the main mechanism for guiding plan implementation, and monitoring, evaluation and reporting, is representative of the focus on ensuring that considerations of the three dimensions of sustainability are represented in approaches to addressing development policy concerns. However, there are defined gaps in the operations of TWGs, which have tended to attract commitment primarily from stakeholders in specific sectors. This is demonstrative of wider challenges to development as it relates to inadequate policy coherence, and persistent retentions of silos and sectoral disconnects in public and private practice. 
  Under Vision 2030 Jamaica, the principle of inclusion is closely aligned to peoplecentredness. This represents an articulation and operationalization of the focus on people that is aligned to the 2030 Agenda core principle of \0xECleaving no one behind. The strategic framework for the achievement of inclusive development includes the adoption of a life cycle approach to development that recognizes that whilst vulnerabilities must be clearly identified and targeted, there must be equitable treatment of the life cycle social, economic and environmental needs of all citizens to prevent and mitigate the effects of vulnerability and to facilitate merit-based allocation of rewards. Within the context of Jamaicais entry into the advanced stage of the demographic transition, with a proportionally large working age population, including a large youth cohort and an \0xECaging to old population, there is widespread consensus that life cycle approaches to development are critical to achieving balanced social, economic and environmental development. 
  There has also been increasing integration of right-based approaches in both public and private institutional arrangements as well as the delivery of social, economic and environmental services. Under Vision 2030 Jamaica, a three-pronged approach of protection, engagement and empowerment has been broadly incorporated. The policy and operational frameworks of the social, economic and environmental sectors have increasingly represented:
\0xEF the integration and/or underpinning of rights-based approaches as demonstrated in such areas as community policing and the reorientation of security personnel for increased recognition of the rights of citizens
\0xEF prioritization in establishing a system for universal access to health 
\0xEF enhancing child protection through strengthening legislation, structures and institutions that support the family, while developing state capacity for monitoring and responding to the developmental needs of all children
\0xEF Jamaicais continued engagement in global processes and commitments to conventions that include protecting the rights of persons with disabilities, children, and migrants. For example, Jamaica has committed to gender mainstreaming with gender focal points positioned in MDAs and the Bureau of Womenis Affairs was renamed to the Bureau of Gender Affairs to facilitate equitable treatment of males and females
\0xEF increasing priority and strategic focus on universal design as a principle for equitably addressing the physical infrastructural and service needs of all citizens, including persons with physical mobility impairments. 
  Vision 2030 Jamaica gives focus to mitigating policy conflicts and trade-offs between the social, economic and environmental dimensions of development that serve to undermine sustainable and inclusive development. This is represented in the strategic approach of the MTF which requires simultaneous focus on the three dimensions of sustainable development with prioritization of strategies and actions to achieve each goal and outcome as opposed to trade-offs involving the dimensions. The approach also includes the identification of inter-sectoral linkages in the content and structure of priorities being pursued as well as intersectoral linkages in relevant institutional arrangements and structures. 
  Since 2010, the Jamaican government has pursued an economic reform programme to address debt and fiscal deficits and structural weaknesses towards greater levels of economic sustainability and inclusive growth. Whilst it commenced in response to the exigencies of the global economic crisis, this programme, which has been supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), has been largely successful and has resulted in critical economic reforms and increased macroeconomic stability. An expected outcome of this programme has been economic displacement of the most vulnerable as evidenced by relatively high poverty rates since 2010. However, the GoJ has ensured that this economic displacement has not been treated as a necessary trade-off and has been engaged in on-going strengthening of the social safety net system to protect the most vulnerable as part of efforts to mitigate the possible adverse effects of the economic reform programme. Although development and growth initiatives have been constrained by limited fiscal space, priority has been given to advancing the development agenda through innovative planning and programming, including strategic initiatives aimed at increased access to education, health, justice services, sanitation, clean water and affordable electricity and the creation of an enabling environment for business development, including increased employment and access to capital and business services to facilitate entrepreneurship. With increasing levels of economic stability, the Jamaican government has given greater focus to job creation as evidenced in the policy and strategic framework for economic development.
  Jamaica has operationalized its response to vulnerabilities to natural and manmade hazards and climate change within the context of social, economic and environmental development. Macro-level priorities pursued have included addressing hazards on land and in water such as social erosion, inadequate waste management, inadequate physical planning, coastal erosion and coral reef degradation. While micro-level priorities pursued have included engagement of communities in hazard risk reduction and climate change mitigation initiatives, as part of advancing social and income security through sustainable livelihoods, and the creation and protection of private and public assets, including infrastructure. 
  While there are gaps in Jamaicais capacity to measure the implementation of and progress towards achieving the SDGs, an assessment of the countryis statistical capacity shows that indicators in all dimensions can be measured. The greatest gaps are evident in the environmental dimension, which has been shown to have the weakest level of policy and strategic alignment between national frameworks and the SDGs. Led by STATIN, priority focus has been given to strengthening the countryis capacity to measure development progress towards achieving Vision 2030 Jamaica and the SDGs. 
  There are evident gaps in Jamaicais capacity to effectively integrate the three dimensions of sustainability in development policy, planning and practice. Notwithstanding, there is sufficient evidence that there is commitment to achieving balanced, inclusive and sustainable social, economic and environmental development. In pursuing growth reliant on the higher forms of capital, focus is

Figure 10: Assessment of national statistical capacity for SDGs indicators
placed on building a knowledge-based economy, strengthening its institutional arrangements, and developing its human capital to advance sustainable and inclusive development. However, the country requires capacity building in the following areas if sustainable and inclusive social, economic and environmental development are to be achieved:
\0xEF Policy coherence, including in the alignment of national and local level planning 
\0xEF Strengthening of national capacity for strategic planning 
\0xEF Strengthening the capacity of local level stakeholders, including municipal corporations and community-based organizations for integration as 
\0xEF Strengthening national data/statistical capacity and the capacity for evidencebased practice to inform development of policies, plans and programmes that effectively integrate the three dimensions of sustainability to ensure that there is timely and defined identification of policy conflicts and possible trade-offs assessments and planning towards advancing inclusive development through targeted and evidence-based disaggregation of data.

Goals and Targets
   he assessment of the 17 SDGs for Jamaica is based on development results for the period 2015n2018. The report outlines progress made, experiences, lessons learned and challenges in the implementation of Vision 2030 Jamaica and by extension the 2030 Agenda. The areas highlighted in the analysis demonstrate the integrated nature and indivisibility of the goals, as well as the value of multistakeholder participation and partnerships. The presentation of each goal gives a snapshot of the policies, programmes and initiatives being implemented based on the country specific priorities in the MTF. This sets the context for the challenges which remain to be addressed in implementation. 
Goal 1 n End poverty in all its forms everywhere
Jamaica has had mixed success in reducing poverty over time. It recorded its lowest rate of poverty in 2007 (9.9 per cent), a significant reduction from the 28.4 per cent in 1990. At that point, Jamaica had achieved the poverty goal of the Millennium Development Goals, 1990n2015. However, the global financial and economic crises of 2008n2009 had a negative effect on the local economy, resulting in a reversal of the gains in poverty over the period. Poverty rates trended upwards from 2008n2013, with the first downward movement recorded between 2013 and 2014. In 2016, there was a further reduction in the poverty rate to 17.6 per cent (see Statistical Annex). The Government has formulated and commenced implementation of various policies and initiatives to end poverty in all forms including:
\0xEF The National Policy Poverty and National Poverty Reduction Programme (NPP/NPRP) which was approved by Parliament in 2017 in support of the eradication of extreme poverty by 2022. 
\0xEF The comprehensive Social Protection Strategy (2014)
\0xEF The National Food and Nutrition Security Policy (2013)
\0xEF The Food Safety Policy (2013)
\0xEF The Climate Change Policy Framework for Jamaica (2015). 
\0xEF The Programme for the Advancement through Health and Education (PATH)
\0xEF Poor Relief Programme.
Key Achievements
\0xEF The Social Protection Strategy seeks to streamline and structure the delivery of social protection by safeguarding social security rights, managing social risks, and contributing positively to social and economic development. Through a systematic, integrated approach, Jamaica ensures a social protection landscape that can respond to various needs through preventive, promotive, protective, mitigative, and transformative interventions. 
\0xEF The government allocated $8.3 billion in Fiscal Year 2017/2018 to its main cash transfer programme, PATH, which had a registration of 345 792 persons \0xF3 elderly, persons with disabilities, children living in poor households, the adult poor and pregnant and lactating women. 
\0xEF Development of the National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) 2016n2020. The goal of the NFIS is to create the conditions in which Jamaicans, particularly those who were previously underserved by the domestic financial system, are able to save safely and build up resilience against financial shocks, and firms are able to invest, grow and generate greater levels of wealth.
\0xEF Continued implementation of programmes to promote access to economic resources including regulating microfinance institutions and lending policies; land titling programmes to strengthen land ownership; on-lending facilities through the Foundations for Competitiveness and Growth Project (FCGP), funded by the World Bank, to micro lending agencies; and fostering strategic partnerships between government and private sector financial institutions. The project, also places emphasis on strengthening the business environment through ongoing strategic reforms, discussed further in Goal 8. 
\0xEF There are also strategies emphasising the promotion of environmentally sustainable livelihoods and reducing climate change associated risks and natural hazards through the regulation of environmental practices. These initiatives are intended to reduce livelihood losses to domestic farmers, fisherfolk, fish farmers and other producers. Through the Ministry of Labour and Social Security and the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management along with other government MDAs grants, in-kind items as well as services are provided to those adversely affected by such events. Building risk resilience including agricultural risk management and the promotion of sustainable agricultural practices are also underscored (see Goals 11 and 13).
\0xEF Income security particularly for the vulnerable and those exposed to the risks of various types of shocks, is paramount. To strengthen this area in practical ways, measures such as disaster-responsive social assistance, crop insurance schemes, relocation strategies, and improved access to micro finance and social insurance are currently being considered. 
  A critical next step for Jamaica is the development of a tailored multidimensional poverty index for the country. The approach being considered departs from the conventional, as it seeks to engage community participation in determining the indicators most relevant to the country.
Challenges
The implementation of the National Poverty Reduction Programme overtime will require adequate financial support. This calls for the mobilization and prioritization of funding, including those provided through partnership with International Development Partners (IDPs). In addition to global and local economic challenges, major weather events have significantly impacted rural poverty in particular, due mainly to the heavy reliance on the agricultural sector. 
Goal 2 n End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture
A key area of focus is to address the food and nutrition needs of the poor and vulnerable, including children, persons with disabilities and the elderly. Within the national context, there is a high level of interlinkages between Goal 2 and other SDGs relating to poverty, womenis empowerment and job creation. This is in keeping with Vision 2030 Jamaica, the National Food and Nutrition Security Policy, and the SPS. Critical to the presentation of national priorities on the agriculture and food security goal, is the focus on climate change adaptation and risk resilience.
Target 2.1 n By 2030, end hunger and ensure access by all people, in particular the poor and people in vulnerable situations including infants, to safe, nutritious and sufficient food all year round.
Jamaica has formally addressed the issues of food security and hunger in its National Food and Nutrition Security Policy (2013). The Policy provides a framework for strategic actions in support of ensuring food availability, affordability, access, stability, and utilization. Special focus is given to the need for food as a basic right of all citizens, and actions to guarantee that the most vulnerable have their food needs met. Medium and long-term strategies also focus on, inter alia, food production and marketing, nutrition and food safety. 
  The school feeding programme is an integral part of the Governmentis initiatives to address food and nutrition security. In 2016, the programme was funded at J$4.5 billion and provided meals for over 560 000 students from the early childhood to secondary levels.
Target 2.2 n End all forms of malnutrition
There is sustained progress to achieve the internationally agreed targets of ending malnutrition by 2025 through the protection and improvement in the nutritional wellbeing of infants and young children. Interventions include: development of nutrition-related policies, delivery of quality food and nutrition services, expert guidance to policy makers, and provision of technical direction for Regional Health Authorities, other MDAs, as well as NGOs.
  National programmes geared towards food security among infants and young children include the Poor Relief Programme and PATH. The Poor Relief programme provides cash and \0xECin-kind benefits that support nutrition. Through the school feeding programme, PATH beneficiaries have access to school meals. 
  Current interventions towards achievement of this target, specifically in the area of health include:
\0xEF Food-Based Dietary Guideline Social Marketing Campaign 
\0xEF Development of the draTh National Infant and Young Child Feeding Policy and Strategic Plan
\0xEF Launch of a National Food Industry Task Force
\0xEF A programme for integrated approach to Neonatal Nutrition was developed under the Programme for Reduction in Maternal and Child Mortality (PROMAC) 
  There is need for sustainable programmes for iron supplementation to address anaemia, a common nutritional deficiency in Jamaican children and adolescents. Despite ad hoc food supplementation, food demonstrations and onsite feeding which are conducted in clinics across the island, and the fortification of selected food items, which has far-reaching effects, challenges remain in relation to routine iron supplementations to reduce anaemia. 
  In relation to targets 2.3n2.4 the issues of hunger and food security are interlinked with the promotion of sustainable agricultural approaches. Approximately 95.0 per cent of domestic food production is undertaken by an estimated 200 000 farmers producing an average of 2 hectares of land or less. The resilience of small-scale agricultural production remains an imperative for the local economy.
  Addressing the livelihood of small farmers and agricultural producers in terms of their income resilience and their adaptability is recognized to have significant impact on domestic food security and its synergy with agricultural production. Through the Ministries with responsibility for agriculture including fisheries, commerce and land, as well as agencies that provide agriculture support, measures exist to address knowledge and capacity of small-scale farmers, land tenure and titling, irrigation, access to markets, competitiveness, inter alia. The combination of supportive measures is intended to advance sustainable agriculture for the domestic economy. Several NGOs and IDPs are involved in the sector in support of the Governmentis strategic thrusts.
  The National Youth in Agriculture Policy and Implementation Plan (2016) provides the framework for youth participation in the agricultural sector. This policy is expected to establish a clear pathway for transition and sustainability in the agricultural sector. 
Other Programmes and Projects instituted to enhance sustainability include:
\0xEF The Import Substitution Programme n designed to ensure the sustainable development of select agro-industries. This programme is geared at reducing Jamaicais dependency on imports as well as achieving self-sufficiency in the selected agro-industries.
\0xEF The Agro Parks Project (2012) n designed to facilitate the expansion of the productive capacity of the agricultural sector through the building of infrastructure to support investments in the production of selected crops, as well as providing raw materials for agro-processing and non-traditional exports. As at 2015, nine Agro Parks were established and operationalized.
\0xEF GLOBALGAP CERTIFICATE Programme is designed to improve efficiency, sustainability and safety in the agricultural production system.
Target 2.5: By 2020, maintain the genetic diversity of: seeds; cultivated plants; farmed and domesticated animals and their related wild species, including through soundly managed and diversified seed and plant banks at the national, regional and international levels; and promote access to fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge as internationally agreed. 
National Seed Policy and Implementation Plan (2018) seeks to establish a sustainable seed system that ensures a consistent and reliable supply of clean, affordable and accessible seeds in support of agricultural production, productivity, food security and biodiversity. There remains need for greater streamlining of resources and collaboration in the relevant sectors, and improved partnership with academia in the area of biodiversity, and plant and animal research.
Goal 3 n Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages
The priorities of the health sector are driven by the strategies outlined in Vision 2030 Jamaica under the national outcome, \0xEBA Healthy and Stable Populationi and are closely aligned with the health-related SDGs and other internationally agreed development frameworks. Health services are provided by a combination of the public and private sectors, as well as non-governmental organizations (NGOs). 
  Jamaica is at an advanced stage of the demographic transition, characterized by the following: a decline in the 0n14 age group; and an increase in both the working age population (15n64 years) and dependent elderly age group (65+ years). This structure impacts social and economic development particularly as it relates to provision of and access to health care services. 
  Over the period under review, there have been major advances in health care delivery, resulting in increased efficiency and access. These included but not limited to: (i) Development of a 10-Year Strategic Plan for the health sector; (ii) a health financing assessment for formulation of a draTh National Health Insurance Plan (iii) advancement in the process of universal health coverage; (iv) infrastructural improvements; (v) implementation of the Programme for the Reduction of Maternal and Child Health (PROMAC); (vi) promotion of healthy lifestyle practices aimed at reducing non-communicable diseases (NCDs) (vii) increased efforts to end the epidemic of HIV/AIDS; (viii) initiatives to reduce global deaths and injuries; and (ix) ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services. 
  The advancements made have been largely through government interventions and partnerships with the Diaspora, charitable organizations locally and overseas, and International Development Partners (IDPs).
  Over the period of review, the priority initiatives undertaken by the Health Sector include:
\0xEF Formulation of a 10-year Strategic Plan n A 10-year Strategic Plan 2017 2027 was designed to provide overarching strategic direction, consistent with the countryis commitment to advance universal access to health, universal health coverage and Vision 2030 Jamaica. The plan seeks to establish an integrated service delivery framework as well as development of an operating tool for early detection of NCDs. 
\0xEF Achievement of universal health coverage and Health Financing n The GOJ partnered with PAHO to identify options and recommend strategies and actions to improve and strengthen health financing, equity and efficiency and delivery of health-care services towards universal health for all. A national forum was held in December 2016 under the theme, \0xECHealth Financing toward Universal Health in Jamaica: International and Policy Options. Feasible options on health financing alternatives with an emphasis on the National Health Insurance (NHI) Scheme was the main highlight and it was recommended that an integrated phased approach be taken to implementation of the scheme and that the benefits should be applied through the National Health Fund. Currently, approximately 20.0 per cent of the population is covered by health insurance. In this regard, a National Health Insurance Plan was draThed through a consultative process, which will form the framework for transitioning to universal insurance coverage for the population.
\0xEF Reduction of Maternal and child Mortality n Improving the health and wellbeing of women and children and infants is an important health goal in Jamaicais national development planning framework. A Programme for the Reduction of Maternal and Child Mortality (PROMAC) funded by the European Union began implementation in 2013 to address the challenges being faced in attaining MDGs 4 and 5. PROMAC focuses on (i) Newborn and emergency obstetric care; (ii) Quality primary health services and referral systems; (iii) health workers training and research; and (iv) support to health seeking behaviour of the target population and the role of civil society. Several actions undertaken include: constructing high dependency units, increasing the cadre of specialized skilled health workers2 and conducting baseline research on the causes and risk factors pertaining to premature births and distribution of midwives bags for maternal and child care at the community level. 
\0xEF Reduction of premature mortality from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) n The strategic priorities for the reduction and control of NCDs are guided by the National Strategic and Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of NCDs in Jamaica 2013n2018. The goal of the Plan is to reduce the burden of preventable morbidity and disability and avoidable premature mortality due to noncommunicable diseases and injuries by 25.0 per cent by 2025. In support of the Plan, several interventions have been undertaken addressing: risk reduction and health promotion management of the disease, improving surveillance and policy development advocacy, governance and capacity building.
\0xEF Substance abuse prevention n Jamaica became party to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) in 2005, this action supports the goal for the strengthening of treatment and prevention of substance abuse and harmful use of alcohol. The Public Health (Tobacco Control) Regulation, 2013 covers only some of the articles of the FCTC (smoke free spaces and graphic health warnings on cigarette packs). Work undertaken by the National Council on Drug Abuse and other agencies has had some impact including the implementation of substance abuse prevention programmes, primary treatment and public awareness initiatives. One important strategy in prevention and control of tobacco usage has been a commitment to enact comprehensive tobacco control legislation in alignment with the FCTC, which covers important articles such as tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship (targeting youth).
\0xEF Promoting Mental Health and well-being n Using the Mental Health in All Policy approach Jamaica has progressed with the formulation of a draTh National Mental Health Policy as well as implementation of the Mental Health Action Plan 2013n2020. Community mental health service is a key component of the plan. High-level multi-stakeholder discussions advanced with the objective to undertake a public health approach, developing mental health systems of care and fostering stronger collaboration and greater accountability for commitments towards community mental health.
\0xEF Promotion of healthy lifestyle practices n A Programme to promote a healthy lifestyle and protect against non-communicable diseases, through a physical activity initiative, \0xECThe Jamaica Moves Programme for Schools Community and Workplaces was implemented. It encourages appropriate health check, physical activity and healthy eating habits including the limitation of sugar intake.
Increased effort to end the epidemic of HIV/AIDS n Addressing the issues of HIV and AIDS are high on the countryis development agenda. Jamaica has an estimated HIV prevalence of 1.7 per cent among the general population. Based on both modelled estimates and the case-based surveillance data, it is estimated that 30 000 persons are currently living with HIV in Jamaica with approximately 12.0 per cent being unaware of their status. Approximately 12 000 adults and children have received antiretroviral treatment contributing to increasing viral suppression rates and decreasing mother to child transmission rates. The national HIV/AIDs response uses a multi-sectoral approach to reduce HIV incidence. The framework for HIV/AIDS response is focused on prevention, treatment, care and support, enabling environment, empowerment and governance. Funding for the HIV response was supported through agreements with donor agencies such as Global Fund, United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the World Bank. The Government of Jamaica has supported the engagement of civil society organizations in HIV service provision and substantial interventions in reaching key affected populations. The advancements made in the delivery of HIV services have been in large part due to the partnerships with and commitment of several CSOs.
Achievements and advances in the care of people living with HIV/AIDS included: the integration of HIV/AIDS services of the national HIV/AIDS programme into the National Family Planning Board; the development of the draTh National Integrated Sexual Health Strategic Plan; establishment of a National HIV/AIDS-Discrimination Reporting and Redress System, development of the National HIV Workplace Policy; and the commissioning of several research to clarify issues for evidence based practice. Prevention strategies have proven successful in the most at risk populations (MARPs) in the continued fight against HIV/AIDS, however, challenges remain. Issues remain largely in the areas of reducing vulnerability to HIV/AIDs, stigma and discrimination that have not been sufficiently addressed. The vehicles for the spread of HIV in Jamaica are primarily among heterosexuals, youth and specific target groups such as men who have sex with men (MSM) and commercial sex workers (CSW) and are influenced by cultural and behavioural issues and must be carefully monitored in reducing the epidemic. Advocacy for resources have been based on generalized populations, however, strategic investments have shiThed to specific target groups such as MSM, CSW and inmates among others.
With support from the Global Fund and UNAIDS, Jamaica has conducted a HIV Transition Preparedness Assessment to examine the countryis readiness to move from donor support to national sustainability for the response to ending AIDS.
\0xEF Reduce global deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents n The legislative framework to support this target was advanced with the draThing of a new Road Traffic Act (2018). This will be supported by the following policies and plans: The National Road Safety Policy (2004), National Transport Policy (2007) and the National Strategic Plan and Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases (2013n2018). There are over 300 collisions involving fatalities annually. Accidents and injuries are among the main causes of visits to accident and Emergency units in public hospitals across the island, approximately 85 per cent of these injuries were classified as unintentional and the remainder intentional. One of the major concern is that most cases of accidents and injuries falls in the 20n64 years age group. Injuries mainly included motor vehicle accidents, accidental lacerations, blunt injuries and stab wounds. There is need for a multi-sectorial approach in addressing the impact of accidents, with the Ministries of National Security, Education, Health and Transport and Works.
\0xEF Ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services n The adolescent SRH programme in Jamaica is supported by the National Strategic Plan for Adolescents and Pre-adolescents 2011n2016 and the Integrated Strategic Framework for the Reduction of Adolescent Pregnancy in the Caribbean (UNFPA and Caribbean). The strategic plan guides health promotion strategies for adolescents, programmatic activities of the MOH, MOEYI and the NFPB, while building partnerships and reorientation of the health services towards an adolescent-friendly approach (see additional details in chapter 5).
Other significant efforts include:
\0xEF Governmentis collaboration with development partners to conduct a HIV adolescent country assessment called the \0xECAll In initiative revealed a 0.1 per cent prevalence of HIV among the cohort of girls and boys 10n14 years, this finding is a reflection of reduction in the mother-to-child transmission of HIV.
\0xEF Increase in vaccination coverage in children 12 to 23 months with the first and second doses of the Mumps, Measles and Rubella vaccine to 95.0 per cent.
\0xEF A project aimed at reducing waiting time at health facilities A 30.0 per cent increase in drug subsidies for all pharmaceuticals and expanded reach for individual benefits programme, such as the Jamaica Drug for the Elderly Programme (JADEP). 
Some of the challenges experienced in the sector include:
\0xEF The lack of significant resources in high dependency care for newborns, as well as, external issues such as: indirect maternal deaths from complications of chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, sickle cell, cardiovascular conditions and HIV impacted achievement of these targets. 
\0xEF The lack of a coordinated multi-sectoral approach aimed at addressing the developmental impact of road traffic accidents.
\0xEF Aged infrastructure
\0xEF A need for comprehensive national Sexual and Reproductive Health Policy and Strategic Plan, which would speak to existing and emerging issues including safe motherhood, in order to effectively address universal access to SRH services.
\0xEF Effects of trauma on the health sector
\0xEF Increased personal responsibility for health, prevention and treatment of noncommunicable diseases and HIV/AIDS, 
\0xEF Strengthening of rehabilitation services for vulnerable persons, including children, the elderly, and persons with disabilities and those with mental health.
Goal 4 n Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all
Jamaica has made significant advances in transforming and repositioning its education system to be the primary driver of sustainable and inclusive development. Under Vision 2030 Jamaica n National Development Plan (2009n2030), the country is pursuing a path towards the achievement of \0xECWorld Class Education and Training as an outcome of a citizenry empowered to achieve its fullest potential. Education and Training serves as a critical engine of social and economic growth and underpins the achievement of environmental sustainability n facilitating a paradigm shiTh from reliance on the lower forms to the higher forms of capital . The strategic framework for the achievement of \0xECWorld Class Education and Training is closely aligned with the imperatives and targets of SDG #4 \0xECEnsure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all. It includes the prioritization of lifelong learning and establishing a standards-driven outcomesbased education system that targets governance, institutional arrangements and capacity, and product and service delivery. These include strengthening school leadership and management, infrastructural development and expansion, establishing mechanisms towards sustainable financing, strengthening the capacity for evidence-based decision making, and human capital development. Equally important is the development of standardized curricula for early childhood through to the secondary level; a regulated tertiary level education sector; and targeted alignment between \0xEBeducation and trainingi and labour market demand. 
  Jamaicais education system has been increasingly geared towards inclusion and equity, including the implementation of tuition-free access to primary and secondary level education and on-going programming to create a framework for sustainable financing of tertiary level education to improve quality and access. The National Education Strategic Plan (NESP, 2011n2020) provides the road map for educational transformation and service delivery over the period 2011n2020. Assessments of the outcomes of implementation of the Strategic Plan and the process to identify the priorities to be pursued post 2020 will be informed by Jamaicais commitment to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
  The NESP comprises seven (7) strategic priorities and eight (8) strategic objectives that are aligned to four (4) sector outcomes as follows:

By 2030, ensure that all youth and a substantial proportion of adults, both men and women, achieve literacy and numeracy
\0xEF The HEART Trust/NTA currently serves as the main state training institution mandated to promote and support the development of the human capital of the country, including lifelong learning.  In 2017, the Jamaica Foundation for Lifelong Learning (JFLL) and the National Youth Service (NYS) were operationally merged with the HEART Trust/NTA. 
\0xEF In the academic year 2016/17, approximately 8,500 individuals (60.2 per cent males) were enrolled in the programmes of the JFLL with 87.2 per cent enrolled in the High School Diploma Equivalency Programme (HSDE)
\0xEF The HSDE is the flagship programme of the JFLL n it comprises a general platform that targets adult learners with limited literacy, school drop-outs and school leavers who have not acquired requisite skills and competencies.  
\0xEF During the academic year 2016/17, 177 Certificates of Completion and 3341 Certificates of Competence were issued by the JFLL.  
4.7
By 2030, ensure that all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development, including among others, through education for sustainable development and sustainable lifestyles, human rights, gender equality, promotion of a culture of peace and nonviolence, global citizenship and appreciation of cultural diversity and of cultureis contribution to sustainable development  
\0xEF The activities relating to this target are being provided through the National Environment and Planning Agency (NEPA), Ministry of Industry, Commerce, Agriculture and Fisheries (MICAF), and the Ministry of Education, Youth and Information (MoEYI).  
\0xEF Some essential issues for sustainable development have been incorporated into the National Standards Curriculum and form the basis for subjects such as
Environmental Science (CAPE), Health and Family Life Education and the Citizenship Education Programme (CEP).  
\0xEF The government has also provided resources for the establishment of 105 new uniformed groups and the celebration of Jamaica Day, Culture Day and Peace Day.

No.
Description

4.a
Build and upgrade education
facilities that are child, disability and gender sensitive and provide safe, non-violent, inclusive and effective learning environments for all 
The Government of Jamaica (GoJ) has:
\0xEF Implemented the Safety and Security Programme in all secondary schools n over 180 Safety and Security Officers were placed in over 130 secondary schools 
\0xEF Developed and implemented the CEP and the Civics Programme, which are intended to broaden studentsi knowledge and appreciation of their civic roles and responsibilities, enhance national identity and pride, and strengthen the value system.  
\0xEF Introduced a School-Wide Positive Behaviour Intervention and Support (SWPBIS) Framework; and in conjunction with UNICEF designed a Child Friendly Schools Manual.  
4.c
By 2030, substantially increase the supply of qualified teachers, including through international cooperation for teacher training in developing countries, especially least developed countries and small
island developing states  
\0xEF In 2016/17, approximately 89.0 per cent of all public school teachers were trained (Trained Graduate and Trained Teacher)   
\0xEF The Early Childhood Education (ECE) level was served by 10, 629 public and private sector teachers with 32.5 per cent trained at the diploma level or higher.  Efforts are underway to improve the supply of trained teachers at the ECE level.
\0xEF The government has provided over 440 STEM
Teachersi Scholarships to increase the supply of qualified teachers  
Challenges
There are gaps in the quality of educational outcomes, institutional and other capacity, and access and policy provisions. The challenges faced include:
\0xEF Studentsi numeracy skills remain below the required standards
\0xEF Inadequate access at the post-secondary and tertiary levels are evidenced by less than targeted gross enrolment rates
\0xEF Gaps in the availability of timely data on diagnostic tests at the early childhood, primary and secondary levels impact evidence-based planning and timely implementation of appropriate strategies
\0xEF Inadequacies in the quality of teacher training and the availability of trained teachers, particularly at the pre-primary/early childhood level 
\0xEF Inadequate levels of accountability in some areas throughout the system
\0xEF Lack of a comprehensive and fully integrated data management system 
\0xEF Greater alignment needed between policy and practice
\0xEF Inadequate gender differentiated teaching and learning strategies
\0xEF Limited accommodation for children with disabilities 
  Building public awareness of the SDGs and targets, and their benefits to national development among the political directorate, community members and other key stakeholders will be critical towards achieving the SDGs implementation, and against a challenging economic backdrop. There is an urgent need to mobilize new and additional investments towards creating equitable and quality education from the pre-primary to tertiary level. 
Goal 5 n Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls
The Government of Jamaica is committed to gender equality and through its gender mainstreaming efforts, which seek to promote the economic, social, cultural and political empowerment of women and men. In keeping with the goals and core principles of the National Policy for Gender Equality, 2011 (NPGE), significant work was advanced to promote and implement gender mainstreaming initiatives within all policies, plans, programmes and projects. The Gender Sector Plan of the Vision 2030 Jamaica and the NPGE provide the framework for gender mainstreaming and non-discrimination within the Jamaican context. These frameworks seek to ensure that all forms of discrimination against women and girls are eliminated.
  There is recognition that Caribbean, and more specifically Jamaican men and boys, are at risk and are facing particular challenges that if not addressed, will affect the achievements of gender equality and equity. Notwithstanding, it is recognized that within the context of Vision 2030 Jamaica and the SDGs that gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls is a key prerequisite. To this end, a number of programmes and policies have been implemented targeting men and boys, while still seeking to continue to empower women and girls.

Figure 12: Community Workshop on Goal 5
Key Achievements
Over the period 2015n2018, the Government prioritised several gender-related initiatives
Legislation and Policies 
\0xEF A raTh of legislation has also been reviewed/implemented to ensure nondiscrimination. A Joint Select Committee of Parliament was set up in 2017 to review the: Sexual Offences Act; the Offences Against the Person Act; Domestic Violence Act; and Child Care and Protection Act. Written submissions were made to the Committee and same were reviewed with a view to amend where relevant.
\0xEF In September 2016, the GOJ ratified the ILO convention C189 promoting Decent Work for Domestic workers to protect their rights as women and as workers. In addition to the equal pay legislation for work of equal value enacted in the 1970s, the GOJ has in more recent years made efforts to promote equal rights for women in the labour market. The Employment (Flexibility Work Arrangements) (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2014 was passed and provides a framework for employers to establish flexible work hours to facilitate the needs of families and workers as well as themselves. 
\0xEF A 10-year National Strategic Action Plan to Eliminate Gender-Based Violence (2016n2026) was developed. The Action Plan focuses on five strategic priority areas: prevention, protection, intervention, legal procedures, and protocols for data collection. To further the intersectoral and integrated response required for gender-based violence (GBV), considerable efforts are being made to establish a shelter to house these victims. 
Programmes
\0xEF Partnership efforts with FBOs and NGOs provide a platform for advocacy and collaboration on the issue. In 2017, the government partnered with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to expand the Woman Inc. Crisis Centre to house additional women and children, who have become victims of violence. The newly renovated and disability-friendly building will include increased number of bedrooms, kitchens and bathrooms and other conducive spaces to accommodate victims. 
\0xEF Progress has been made in the safe return of victims as well as the arrest and charge of perpetrators of human trafficking. The National Task Force against Trafficking in Persons (NATFATIP) hosted public awareness and knowledge sharing events around the issue of trafficking in persons.
\0xEF Recognizing the link with the health sector, standard operating procedures have been developed for healthcare workers engaged in primary care, emergency care, mental health and paediatrics. 
\0xEF The International Labour Organization (ILO), Women in Business and Management: Gaining Momentum in the Latin America and the Caribbean, 2017, study, indicates that Jamaica has the highest proportion of women managers globally (59.3 per cent). The study also found that while women are still under-represented in top management, the number of women in senior and middle management positions has increased over the last 20 years. Jamaica was recognized by the European Union (EU) for its role in the empowerment of women, and in particular for closing the gender gap in the public service. 
\0xEF Under the governmentis Land Administration and Management Programme (LAMP), over 200 Jamaicans including women were able to collect land titles up to 2016. 
Women in Decision-making and Leadership
\0xEF A study commissioned by the Womenis Resource and Outreach Centre (WROC) in 2013 on Women on Boards and Committees confirmed that women were on 33.0 per cent of public sector boards and 16.0 per cent of private sector boards. Several training workshops were organized to prepare women to participate effectively on Boards and published a directory was of women who were qualified to fill this gap. Nonetheless, Gender inequality in this area of public leadership continues to be a challenge. 
\0xEF A noticeable gap is evident in the number of female parliamentarians, of the 63 parliamentarians, only 11 were women. The GoJ is also committed to employing Temporary Special Measures (TSMs) to achieve the recommendations made by CEDAW and the National Policy for Gender Equality (NPGE) for the 30.0 per cent of women in Parliament and national boards and commissions. Jamaica has nevertheless achieved a remarkable level of representation of women in legislative bodies, and in senior and middle management positions in government service.
Sexual and Reproductive Health 
The GOJ is committed to ensuring universal and equitable access to sexual and reproductive health to all members of the society, especially to the most vulnerable. Lead by the Ministry of Health and the National Family Planning Board, in partnership with several CSOs, NGOs and IDPs, several initiatives were prioritised:
\0xEF Elements of the National HIV Programme were integrated into the National Family Planning Board. Arising from this process, the National Integrated Strategic Plan for Sexual and Reproductive Health and HIV (2014n2019) was developed. The priority areas of this strategic plan are Prevention and SRH Outreach; Universal Access to Treatment, Care and Support and SRH Services,
Enabling Environment and Human Rights; Monitoring and Evaluation of HIV; Family Planning and Sexual Health Responses; and Sustainability, Governance and Leadership.
\0xEF The preparation of a draTh Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) Policy to protect and guarantee sexual health and reproductive rights with the aim to provide universal access to comprehensive, appropriate and relevant sexual and reproductive health services, information and commodities. 
\0xEF Development of quality of care standards for adolescent health services. In 2016, the Womenis Centre of Jamaica Foundation (WCJF), with the affiliated Jamaica Family Planning Association, opened an Adolescent Resource Centre (ARC). The ARC provides a range of SRH clinical and counselling services3 to teen mothers and \0xEBbaby fathersi.
\0xEF Jamaica is the pilot country for the regional initiative \0xEBEvery Caribbean Woman, Every Caribbean Girl (CARIWAC)i designed to address health (including reproductive) needs of women and girls. In partnership with UNFPA, CARICOM and the First Ladies of the Caribbean, one of the initiatives is to promote the health and well-being of adolescents in the Caribbean, including a reduction in adolescent pregnancy by 20.0 per cent by 20194. A plan of action for advocacy around the main areas has been developed and it is expected that the project will help to fill an essential need for the development of evidencebased policy around the issues of mother to child transmission of HIV, cervical cancer and the reduction of violence against women and girls.
\0xEF The government initiated a Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccination programme in 2017 targeting females age 11n13 years. The objective of the programme is to prevent an increase in the number of cases of cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is a major public and reproductive health problem in Jamaica as almost 50.0 per cent of the women who are diagnosed each year may die. The introduction of this vaccine into the routine immunization programme is expected to provide 90 100% protection against the Human Papilloma Virus.
\0xEF To encourage greater access and use of health facilities/services, a \0xECTeen Hub was established in a major transport centre in the national capital targetting adolescents. Benefits ranged from access to computer and other technological tools as well as the counselling of staff to offer guidance and healthcare information. 
Menis Issues
\0xEF The Male Desk was re-established in the Bureau of Gender Affairs in 2016. The Special Service Desk for Men serves as a central point to provide sensitization and awareness-raising on a range of issues affecting men and boys. These include parenting, health, education, and the role of men in the elimination of violence against women. It also focuses on policy, research and gender sensitive training to develop leadership and promote responsible male behaviours and attitudes. Recognizing the importance of issues relating to men and boys, several malefocused programmes including Community Liaison programmes were implemented by the government in partnership with CSOs, FBOs and IDPs. Community education and sexual and reproductive health (SRH) education were offerred through health fairs. 
\0xEF There has been an increase in the numbers of CSOs addressing the crisis of male identity for example. \0xECMan Up Jamaica, an NGO that caters to males aged 13n 30 years includes a mentorship and training programme. This programme involves building the concept of healthy masculinity. Some 300 young men between the ages of 12n25 years participated in a programme which addressed key malenrelated issues including the importance of fatherhood, families, marriage, self-development, and treating women with love, respect and nonviolence. 
\0xEF Academia plays a critical role in supporting gender-based programmes. The Institute for Gender and Development Studies (IGDS), UWI, Mona has a focus on men in its teaching, research and outreach programmes. The course \0xEBMen and Masculinities in the Caribbeani facilitates participation in a regional IGDS research project on Caribbean Masculinities. 
Data and Research
\0xEF Data from the 2015 Jamaica Survey of Living Conditions (JSLC) shows that 40.8 per cent of female-headed households compared with 33.8 per cent of maleheaded households were more likely to own a working computer. Jamaica has advanced several initiatives to encourage more women in ICT and to participate in STEM field. 
\0xEF The Womenis Health Survey, the first of its kind in CARICOM, was conducted in Jamaica in 2016 and is to be launched and disseminated in June 2018. The survey report provides data on the national prevalence of violence against women and will support the countryis monitoring of its global normative commitments
on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, as well as, support implementation of the National Strategic Action Plan to Eliminate Gender-Based Violence and related plans, policies and laws.
  The NPGE plays a pivotal role in the governmentis mandate to achieving and strengthening gender equality and empowerment of women. Jamaica, a signatory to several agreements on the empowerment of women and the protection of their human rights remains committed to ensuring their full participation in political, leadership, civil, cultural, social and economic life.
Challenges
To have more equitable, socially just and inclusive outcomes, emphasis is needed to ensure that women have equal rights to access, ownership, control of land and economic opportunities, these we strong interlinkages with SDGs 2, 3 and 8. Steps need to be taken to challenge and remove the barriers women face in getting land tenure and access to productive resources. Economic opportunities include having the requisite representation of females on public and private sector boards, as well as improved representation in the Parliament (including the upper and lower houses). 
  In order to improve evidenced-based decision-making and programming, the lack of data disaggregated by sex, age and other characteristics needs improvement Without disaggregated data, vital information is missed about the existing differences and gaps which are likely to give rise to unfocused, inadequate or mismatched responses and targetting.
  The issue of GBV is still a concern, evidenced by the levels of violence that have been meted out to women particularly in domestic circumstances. It is expected that the data from the Womenis Health Survey will assist in the implementation of the strategic action plan to eliminate GBV.
  While the number of teenage pregnancy has declined over the years, it remains a major challenge, particularly among adolescent girls from poor and rural communities. 
Goal 6 n Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all
Jamaica is known as \0xECthe land of wood and water due to its abundance of trees (forests), rivers, streams and wells. Many of these water bodies are the main sources of potable water for most Jamaicans. They are divided into 10 hydrological basins and 26 Watershed Management Unit which assist in their use and management. The WRA has the legal mandate for the management, protection, and controlled allocation and use of Jamaicais water resources. The WRA also maintains a webbased hydrologic database5 to support its activities. The Water Resources Authority (WRA) indicated that Jamaica has a surplus of freshwater resources to meet the human and ecological needs up to 2025. Goal 6 is directly aligned to several national outcomes of Vision 2030 Jamaica, including \0xECHealthy and Stable Population, \0xECStrong Economic Infrastructure, \0xECSustainable Management and Use of the Environment and Natural Resources, and \0xECHazard Risk Reduction and Adaptation to Climate Change. 
  Progress has been made in achieving universal and equitable access to safe water and adequate sanitation and hygiene for all. For 2015 data6 revealed that the majority of households (80.1
Figure 13: Sewer connections and onsite improved facilities: per cent) has access to an improved national	drinking water source. Whilst universal access is reported for the Kingston Metropolitan Area (KMA) n the most densely populated urban area n the figure is somewhat less for Other Towns (88.9 per cent) and significantly less for Rural Areas (63.9 per cent). 
  The data also show that there is universal access to improved sanitation facilities, where the majority of households (82.8 per cent) reported exclusive use of these facilities. However over the period 2006n2015, only 30.0 per cent of households were connected to a sewer network, which has implications for the pollution of surface and underground water sources, and risks associated with the transmission of waterborne diseases.7 The State of the Environment (SoE) Report, 2013, reports that only 20.0 per cent of sewage treatment plants were compliant with national standards, which have implications for ambient water quality (see chapter on Goal 12 for additional information). It is anticipated that updates to the 2001 Water Quality Atlas for Jamaica will be completed in the 2018/2019 financial year. This resource is expected to provide easy access to information on water quality for selected waterways and also facilitate a reasonable comparison on the general improvement or degradation of water quality over the past decade. 
  A number of programme/initiatives and projects were implemented and undertaken to address the challenges with respect to water and sanitation management in Jamaica, see table 3:
Table 3: Priority issues and related policies, programmes, projects and initiatives for Goal 6
Priority Issues 
Policies, Programmes, Projects and Initiatives 
Degradation of water quality
There has been ongoing efforts to improve the governance framework, infrastructure access, and the promotion of efficient resource use.
High levels of non-revenue water
(NRW) and high energy costs
In order to reduce high levels of NRW in utility service areas over the short to medium-term, the NWC has embarked on several projects including:  (i) Jamaica Water Supply Improvement Project, (ii) KMA Water Supply Improvement Programme and (iii) Non-Revenue Water Reduction Co-Management Programme. 
Ageing infrastructure and under metering for 15.0 per cent of the population
A combination of mains replacement, installation of solid state water metres and other technical and commercial interventions were undertaken.
Inequalities regarding  access to drinking water source by geographic region 
A Water Sector Policy (2018) was formulated. It outlines six guiding principles namely: (i) sustainability and intergenerational equity; (ii) efficiency; (iii) Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM); (iv) universal access; (v) responsiveness to gender and vulnerable groups; and (vi) stakeholder participation.  The policy seeks to improve water supply in utility and non-utility service areas in an equitable manner, and also makes provisions for managing wastewater.
Inequalities to access  improved drinking water source by geographic region and low level of connection to a sewerage network
The NWC is continuing efforts to improve connection to the sewerage network, through the Caribbean Regional Fund for Wastewater Management (CReW) Pilot programme. Additionally, two wastewater treatment plants were constructed and three treatment plants were also rehabilitated.  The government is constructing a centralised wastewater treatment plant to significantly reduce the levels of groundwater contamination from onsite disposal systems.

A Forest Policy for Jamaica (2017) was formulated.  It aims to protect and  sustainably manage water-related ecosystems, including the restoration of watersheds.
A Rural Water Supply Development Strategy was formulated to address access to improved water sources in rural areas
A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed
by key MDAs to facilitate greater levels of inter-agency 
co-operation in the area of water quality. 
Work is being undertaken under the Rural Water
Upgrading and Repairs Project and the Rainwater
Harvesting and Catchment Tank Rehabilitation Programme to upgrade and rehabilitate minor water supply systems and rehabilitate and repair catchment tanks in several rural communities.
Unsustainable land and water management agricultural practices
The GOJ/Adaptation Fund Programme has facilitated the establishment or formalization of Water Users Groups to enhance land and water management at the community level. 
Need for better quality climate and hydo-meteorological data for decision-making support
The Pilot Programme for Climate Resilience (PPCR) through the Improving Climate Data and Information Project has strengthened the monitoring, assessment and forecasting capabilities of the WRA and Meteorological Service of Jamaica.  The establishment of a real-time hydro-meteorological monitoring network was also facilitated.

Goal 7 n  Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all
Energy security and efficiency are critical to Jamaicais sustainable transformation to developed country status. Notwithstanding the downward trend seen over the past decade, Jamaica still has one of the highest energy intensities in the Latin American and Caribbean region (10 900 BTU/US$ GDP in 2016), and like many other SIDS, is heavily reliant on imported fossil fuels. The countryis oil bill is approximately US$2.0 billion annually, equivalent to 14.2 per cent of 2016 GDP. The Electricity Sub-sector accounts for almost one-third of petroleum consumption in Jamaica. High energy costs have been cited as a major impediment to the competitiveness of local manufacturers, and a leading contributor to the failure rate of micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). At the level of the household, electricity payments account for a growing share of household expenditure with an average of 6.5 per cent allocated to this utility in 2015. 
  Policy, legislative and operational reforms are underway to address the main challenges in the sector. These reforms are anchored in Vision 2030 Jamaica and the National Energy Policy (NEP) 2009n2030, through which Jamaica affirmed its vision of an energy sector which is modern, efficient, diversified, and sustainable. The NEP Framework was awarded by the IMF for the Best government Infrastructure Strategy in the Caribbean, 2016. As a result, the framework of the NEP was also adapted into the CARILEC (Caribbean Electric Utility Services Corporation) Energy Policy. The Electricity Act (2015) was promulgated to consolidate and modernize the existing laws relating to the generation, transmission, distribution, supply, dispatch and use of electricity and connected matters. In keeping with the provision of the Act, the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Science, Energy and Technology (MSET) is being strengthened to enable the execution of its new mandate for energy planning. The policy landscape was further strengthened with the passage of the Building Act, 2018. The Act provides for the establishment of the National Building Code which includes Energy Efficiency Building Code Requirements and Guidelines. In addition, an Integrated Resource Plan is currently under preparation to establish a comprehensive decision support tool and road map for meeting Jamaicais electricity grid objectives over the next 20 years (2018n2038). 
  Reforms in the energy sector are intended to contribute significantly in the countryis climate change mitigation targets. Under the Paris Agreement, Jamaica, through its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) has committed to a 7.8 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. This is to be achieved primarily through actions in the energy sector. In addition, Jamaica is developing a Renewable Energy (RE) Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action (NAMA) through which the expansion of electricity generation from renewable resources is being facilitated. The RE NAMA will be supported by the design of a Monitoring Reporting and Verification (MRV) system. 
  Goal 6 of the NEP envisages government as the leader and model of energy conservation and environmental stewardship. To this end, the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Programme (EECP) and Energy Security and Efficiency programmes are currently being implemented. Both initiatives collectively aim to improve the policy environment for energy conservation and efficiency and to reduce energy consumption in the public sector. Under the EECP, the Energy Efficiency and Conservation (EEC) Standards Guide for the Public Sector was developed. Launched in February 2018, adoption of these guidelines is expected to facilitate improved energy performance and reduced public sectoris fuel bill. 
  Some tangible gains with respect to energy security, efficiency and fuel diversification (including greater proportions of cleaner and renewable sources) have been evident since the adoption of the NEP. The Energy Efficiency and Conservation Projects implemented in the  public sector since 2013, for example, has resulted in electricity savings of at least 5 663 463 kWh, equivalent to USD$2.0 million (and 4 509 tonnes of avoided CO2 emissions) as at 2017. Implementation of another government-led initiative, the Energy Security and Efficiency Enhancement Project (ESEEP), has facilitated investments of approximately US$1.6 billion in the energy sector n two natural gas import and storage infrastructure, two liquefied natural (LNG) gas power plants, 114 MW diesel-fired power plant converted to use natural gas, two wind farms, two solar plants, and one hydro plant n since its inception in 2011. Since 2015, additional investments of USD$40 million (loan and grant funds) have been secured with assistance from the international development community to facilitate renewable energy (RE) and energy efficiency (EE) interventions in highconsuming public facilities, and to reduce fuel consumption in the transport sector through better urban traffic management. In addition, a national project was launched in 2015 under the Global Fuel Economy Initiative (GFEI) with the aim of improving fuel economy and efficiency in the transport sector, reducing vehicle emissions and improving air quality through the use of cleaner fuels. Among the achievements to date is the establishment of a national auto fuel economy database (for light duty vehicles) and a diagnostic study report on air quality management in Jamaica. The private sector has also been actively engaged in developing policy proposals towards a cleaner, more efficient transport sector. Government support is also being provided to the private sector to improve energy performance. This is being done through a loan facility established under the ESEEP and managed by the Development Bank of Jamaica. As at the end of 2017, loans disbursed to MSMEs for RE and EE projects totalled US$5.4 million.  
  Jamaica has also engaged in the expansion of energy related infrastructure and the upgrade of technology towards modernising and diversifying its energy options.
With a 2030 target of 20.0 per cent renewables in the total energy mix and 30.0 per cent electricity generation from renewable resources, research is ongoing into the feasibility of exploiting available local RE resources (such as wind, solar, hydro, biofuels and biomass) and diversifying into cleaner fuels such as natural gas. On the basis of total installed capacity the MSET reported an RE percentage (in the total energy mix) of 12.5 per cent for 2014/2015, which meets the Vision 2030 Jamaica target for 2015. As it relates to the use of clean fuels and technology, the main energy sources for cooking at the household level were liquid petroleum gas (80.3 per cent) and electricity was their main source for lighting at 94.9 per cent. This is consistent with a reported 98.2 per cent electrification rate and a continual move away from use of solid fuels such as wood and charcoal for domestic purposes. In April 2018, a pilot project was launched to distribute solar lamps to residents in inner-city communities. The project is intended to reduce the risks to health and safety associated with the use of kerosene lamps. Between 2015 and 2016, RE training capacity was enhanced with the commissioning of the Wigton Renewable Energy Training Laboratory and Research Centre. The state-of-the-art facility supports research, training and demonstration for a range of RE technologies such as solar thermal, photovoltaics, concentrated solar power, wind power, hydro and bio-energy. The facility is utilized by universities, public agencies, and industry professionals and is poised to deliver training services to the region. In addition, an Innovation Lab was opened in April 2018, under the auspices of the Caribbean Climate Innovation Centre Change to foster the development of clean technologies and promote green entrepreneurship across the Caribbean region.
  Since 2015, the foundation has been laid for the addition of up to 115 Megawatts (MW) of new generating capacity from renewables (mainly solar and wind) in the short to medium term. Some US$750 million are being invested in a new liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in Montego Bay towards the development of a competitive gas sub-sector, and to position the country as a regional hub for natural gas. At the same time, the findings of a GOJ-commissioned feasibility assessment launched in 2017 to explore the use of gas-based fuels {LNG, LPG and compressed natural gas (CNG)} for public passenger fleets are being awaited to inform the governmentis decision on the shiTh to alternative fuels. The transport sector is a significant consumer of fossil fuels (almost one-third of petroleum imports), contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution (particulate matter, sulphur dioxide, nitrous oxides and others). Other developments in the natural gas sub-sector include upgrades at the Bogue Power Plant (201 MW) and Old Harbour Power (190 MW) to facilitate the replacement of traditional heavy fuel oils with LNG, simultaneously diversifying Jamaicais fuel options and reducing the countryis carbon footprint (see Annex on Case Study of the Jamaica Public Service Company Limited (JPS)). Oil and gas exploration continues to form part of the long-term strategy to secure Jamaicais energy future. These achievements have contributed to improved performance on international indices such as the Global Architecture Performance Index (moving from 92 in 2017 from 116 in 2009). 
  In spite of the achievements to date, Jamaicais goals and targets towards achieving Vision 2030 Jamaica Outcome 10 (Energy Security and Efficiency) and SDG 7 have not been fully realized. The Auditor General has identified some contributor issues which the country has begun to address. These include: 
\0xEF Relevant sub-policies of the NEP remain in draTh since 2010
\0xEF Weak coordination of cross-sectoral government linkages in implementing strategies for energy diversification
\0xEF Use of different measurement frameworks to assess energy consumption from RE sources.
  Local efforts also continue to be constrained by a reliance on imported materials and equipment for the implementation of energy projects as there is no local industry around the design and manufacture of RE and EE solutions. These along with the paucity of data on RE and EE capacity and consumption at the household/business level, are challenges which the country must overcome.

Case Study n Wigton Windfarm
Wigton Windfarm Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Petroleum Corporation of Jamaica (PCJ) is the largest wind energy facility in the English-speaking Caribbean, began operations in 2004 with 20.7MW capacity (Wigton Phase I), then expanded to 38.7 megawatt (MW) generating plan in 2010 (addition of an 18MW extension facility Wigton Phase
II) and to 62.7MW capacity in 2016 (addition of 24MW-Wigton Phase III). According to the Ministry of Science, Energy and Technology, Ministry Papers 2015n2016, the Windfarm was created \0xECto provide, and/or facilitate, increased wind energy development, along with other renewable energy sources for the generation of electricity, thereby contributing to the diversification of


Figure 15: Wind vanes at the Wigton Windfarm
Jamaicais energy mix. WWFL Phase I was registered as a CDM project in March 2006. Wigton has the distinction of being the first Clean Development Mechanism (CMD) project in Jamaica, to be registered under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
  The annual projected total plant output of the Wind Farm is 164, 775 MWh. The company as an Independent Power Producer (IPP)), sells electricity to the Jamaica Public Service Company (JPSCo) under an executed power purchase agreement (PPA). Currently the companyis output accounts for 6.2 per cent of the gridis installed generating capacity and 3.7 per cent of Jamaicais electricity generation.
  Wigton has been involved in capacity building initiatives in renewable energy by providing training to staff, external students and professionals in its training lab from Jamaica and the wider Caribbean. A Resource Centre was constructed in 2010 at the Windfarm complex where the company established the Wigton Renewable Energy Training Lab. In December 2015, the training lab benefitted from a partial grant programme from the OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID), which led to an outfit of the lab with working training models from Renewables Academy, Germany. The lab had previously installed solar roof using a grant from the British High Commission. 
  Due to changes in priorities, the GOJ is in the process of undertaking preparatory work for the privatization of Wigton Windfarm Limited (WWFL) via listing WWFL on the stock exchange. It is expected that the listing will be completed by September 2018.
Best practices and lessons learned
\0xEF Warton is not only an established energy producer but it also houses a training facility for capacity development in renewable energy. The wind farm acts as a valuable educational resource. Most schools and colleges now have energy and the environment on the curriculum, and windfarms make an ideal study for technical, social and environmental projects. 
\0xEF Wigton learned of the strict grid connection rate tariffs in Jamaica where any imports of reactive energy demand are heavily penalized therefore Wigton has experience using distributed wind turbine controls, capacitor systems, and centralized capacitor bank systems. 
\0xEF In 2007, the company received the Jamaica Bureau of Standardsi National Quality Award for excellent demonstration of the application of standards and quality systems in production and service delivery. The company also won the Jamaica Institution of Engineers award for Project of the Year for the Phase I and Phase II projects and was nominated for the Phase III Project. 
\0xEF WWFL stands as an example of the sustained development that renewable energy can have on the environment. 
Barriers or challenges 
\0xEF Government procurement timelines 
\0xEF Receiving the necessary approvals for the plant development for example long timelines to receive parish council building permits. 
\0xEF Transportation of turbines and wind turbine blades through the rugged terrain where road modifications had to be done. 
\0xEF Local expertise in wind energy technology were not available 
\0xEF Process to CDM accreditation was cumbersome and expensive 
\0xEF Regulatory structure / framework had to be reviewed particularly as it relates to Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) negotiations since it was the first of its kind for the country: There was a 3 year challenge to get the grid to agree to the first PPA and that first rate was not economical therefore the Ministry of Energy and the Regulator had to conduct studies on reasonable rates for renewable energy injection. The Regulator for future calls for grid energy developed a standard Power Purchase Agreement template in 2013. However, foreign investors get more favourable payment terms in US$ currency making this a challenge for local companies. Also, Government companies such as Wigton must budget and report in J$ therefore reporting foreign exchange losses. 
\0xEF Balancing the intermittent nature of windfarms to ensure stability on the national grid: Grid operator has to be trained, and models and wind forecast data obtained as renewable energy penetration increases. 
\0xEF Land use challenges of mining versus wind-farming since the wind is site specific. 
\0xEF Lack of existing wind studies and maps for Jamaica hence Wigton conducted an IADB study in conjunction with students from the University of the West Indies who were able to conduct research with the data and build a domestic wind 10 metre height map of Jamaica for the Ministry of Energy to aid small home users who may want to install wind energy. 
Linkages with UN Sustainable Development Goals 
SGD1 n No poverty n Wigton Windfarm Limited is creating a capital base for the country by building more equity in each phase on the project. Also, Wigton employs technical staff thereby contributing to poverty reduction. In addition, the training aspect breaks down barriers by building human capacity to employ more persons in the renewable energy field and hence lower poverty. 
SDG4 n Quality Education n Wigton Windfarm Limited promotes quality education through continuous training of the staff compliment as well as through opening a Renewable Energy training lab to train the wider public. 
SDG5 n Gender Equality n Wigton Windfarm Limited promotes gender equality employing both men and women in all areas from administration, management, and technical competences. In addition, the training in marketed to the general public for men and women. 
SDG7 n Affordable Clean Energy n Wigton Windfarm Limited has a direct track record in developing, owning, building and operating clean energy through renewable energy projects. The company has 3 utility scale wind farm phases as well as encourages solar photovoltaics (PV) use. For example, Wigton Windfarm Limited worked with a grant agency to implement 4.5 kW of solar PV at a school in Kingston, Jamaica from 2014. Then through Wigtonis parent company got 5 kW solar PV for a school adjacent to the wind farm in 2017. In addition, Wigton has 12 kW of solar PV at the training lab roof and 2.4 kW at the security post. 
SDG8 n Decent Work and Economic Growth n Wigton Windfarm Limited employees graduate engineers for the operations and maintenance of the wind farm complex as opposed to many wind farm owners who engage in long term maintenance contracts with the wind turbine manufacturers. Therefore, Wigton Windfarm Limited provides quality employment for Jamaicans. 
SDG13 n Climate Action n Wigton Windfarm Limited plays a direct role in climate change mitigation by generating clean, renewable energy to offset fossil fuel generation and thus producing emissions reductions as there are no greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions such as methane and carbon dioxide produced nor any gases that lead to respiratory disease or acid rain such as SOx or NOx. 
SDG17 n Partnerships for the Goals n Wigton Windfarm Limited forms many partnerships working with the University of the West Indies to conduct some of their labs, University of Technology also for some of their labs and their research initiatives. In addition to these, the company is also collaborating with the Caribbean Maritime University, Northern Caribbean University, Human Employment and Resource Training Trust / National Training Agency (HEART Trust / NTA), National Tool and Engineering Institute to be trained to deliver the Wigton Renewable Energy curriculum to continue to deliver the courses from the Wigton training lab. Wigton has formed partnerships with the Association of Caribbean Utilities and the CARICOM Secretariat Energy Desk.
Goal 8 n Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all
As a small, open and indebted country, Jamaica remains highly vulnerable to external shocks in the global economy. However, the country has achieved progress in stabilizing the macro economy following the impact of the 2008n2009 global economic downturn. The levels of economic growth achieved since then, remain lower than what is expected due to structural weaknesses which have contributed to the country still producing below its pre-crisis peak in 2007. 

  The improvements recorded for real GDP and employment levels in recent years, reflect a renewed committment by the GOJ to create the enabling environment to strengthen growth and improve job creation. These objectives are being supported by sound macroeconomic policy and business sector reforms. 

  Over the years, several measures were undertaken to provide a stable macroeconomic framework, including fiscal consolidation, debt management and tax reform. These measures are combined with reforms targetted at improving the dynamic efficiency of the economy through enhancement of the business environment to increase competitiveness. Reforms include: streamlining development approvals; improving land ownership, titling and transfer processes; increasing access to capital; improving the efficiency of labour markets; and strengthening the capacities and performance of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). 
To achieve macroeconomic stability, the GOJ pursued a fiscal consolidation programme aligned with the Vision 2030 Jamaica. This is being supported by the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and the successor three-year precautionary Stand-byArrangement (SBA) with the international Monetary Fund (IMF). One of the key elements of the programme is the amendment of the Financial Administration & Audit and Public Bodies Management & Accountability Acts in 2014, to include enhanced fiscal rules. The objectives of the amendments were, among other things, to:
\0xEF strengthen the fiscal rules governing public financial management
\0xEF provide greater transparency in the conduct of fiscal policy 
\0xEF reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio to 60.0 per cent or less by the end of Fiscal Year 2025/26.
These measures, along with other reforms, contributed to:
\0xEF reduction in the countries Debt-to-GDP ratio from 145.1 per cent in March 2013, to 103.3 per cent as at December 2017
\0xEF seven years of single digit inflation
\0xEF relatively high business confidence over the last three years, which has resulted in an increase in loans and advances to the productive sector.
  Improvement in the business environment is another factor contributing to the improvement in economic outcomes. These improvements have been supported by the work of the National Competitiveness Council (NCC), which has, since 2010, facilitated the development of policies and programmes that have paved the way to improve the business environment. Jamaica was ranked 70th out of 190 countries overall in the ease of Doing Business 2018 report. The countryis highest rankings were in the areas of Starting a Business and Getting Credit, where Jamaica was ranked 5th and 20th, respectively. 
  To further strengthen growth in the economy, the GOJ established an Economic Growth Council (EGC) in 2016, which is mandated to establish a framework to facilitate and engender growth. The Council liaises with MDAs as well as the private sector to ensure their inclusion and proper monitoring and evaluation. The EGC has been pursuing eight strategies deemed to be important for Jamaica to accelerate growth. These are:
\0xEF maintain macroeconomic stability and pursue debt reduction strategies
\0xEF improve citizen security
\0xEF improve access to finance
\0xEF pursue bureaucratic reform to improve the business environment
\0xEF stimulate greater asset utilization
\0xEF build human capital

harness the power of the diaspora
\0xEF catalyze the implementation of strategic projects.
  Jamaica is fully aware of the contribution of the tourism sector to the economy and its overall sustainable development. Tourism is one of the countryis most resilient sectors and foreign exchange earner in the Jamaican economy. Its share of the economy increased to 8.4 per cent in 2016 from 4.7 per cent in 2007. The benefits of tourism to the economy stretches to other linked sectors such as agriculture, construction, manufacturing, transportation, creative and cultural industries and utilities  and is estimated at 18.0 per cent of GDP. 
Over the period 2016n2019, specific focus for the sector is geared towards: 
\0xEF Strengthening linkages with other sectors of the economy particularly the agricultural and manufacturing sectors
\0xEF Strengthening the benefits derived from the industry by local residents and communities
\0xEF Promoting broader participation by all Jamaicans; and
\0xEF Ensuring the safety, security and sustainability of the natural and built environments.
  Currently, Jamaica is at an advanced stage of its demographic transition which presents an opportunity to capitalize on its demographic dividend. This presents Jamaica with its proportionally largest working age population projected up to 2030 and the potential for human resource driven productivity and growth. The approach being pursued by Jamaica to achieve stronger and more inclusive economic growth is through greater alignment of the labour market needs with education and training, and economic development underpinned by job creation; while enhancing state and private sector managed social and income security systems. 
  Labour market reform remained a priority for the government, through the establishment of the Labour Market Commission on the reform agenda. Jamaicais Labour Market Reform is underpinned by four guiding principles: (i) efficiency, (ii) equity, (iii) growth, and (iv) social justice. In pursuit of labour market reform, the Commission completed its report which focused on five thematic areas: 
\0xEF Education and Training
\0xEF Industrial Relations
\0xEF Labour Policies and Legislation
\0xEF Social Protection
\0xEF Technology, Innovation and Productivity.
  Specific actions taken to implement aspects of SDG 8 over the period include the following:
Policy interventions have been implemented to support initiatives to drive the expansion of activities in new and emerging growth areas (Logistics, Business Process Outsourcing, Digital Animation, etc.) and in Micro, Small and MediumSized Enterprises (MSMEs) as well as improving labour productivity. The average real value added per employed person increased by 2.8 per cent in 2016 relative to J$1 456 313 in 2015. 
\0xEF In support of efforts to achieve Full Employment and Decent Work with Equal Pay, Jamaica continues to be an exemplary working environment that upholds labour rights for all workers, without any discrepancies towards migrants or women. Jamaica has ratified a total of 26 ILO conventions inclusive of the 8 fundamental conventions. The minimum wage and a new time and a half rate paid to workers was increased in 2016 with equal pay provision consistent with Jamaicais ratification of the ILO C100 Equal Remuneration Convention. This in part, has created a work ecosystem of equal pay. Jamaica has the highest proportion of public sector female managers in the world. 
\0xEF The implementation of the Disabilities Act, 2014, has reinforced and promoted the acceptance of the principle of equal fundamental rights for people with disabilities.
\0xEF Several initiatives were undertaken specifically targeting the youth population. Amongst the initiatives to support entrepreneurship was the launch of the Youth in Business initiative in 2017, aimed at empowering the socially excluded and underserved youth to start and grow their own business. Over the same period, the National Apprentice Programme was relaunched with widespread support across public and private sectors. This transitive arrangement has facilitated the increase in employment and employability and access to training and certification for youth. The Housing, Opportunity, Production and Employment (HOPE) and Learn, Earn, Give and Save (LEGS) initiatives undertaken by the government represent a major thrust towards alleviating youth issues. The first phase of HOPE focused on employment with the creation of 15 000 jobs and the development of employability skills through a one-year engagement strategy for unattached youths in seven service corps n document management and digitisation; environment management; geographic information systems; infrastructure and construction; registration, verification and audit; hospitality; and the national service enlistment programme. 
\0xEF The merger of the three premiere training institutions subsumed under the HEART Trust/ NTA in 2017, has created a more efficient, streamlined and dynamic organization. As part of the Governmentis Public Sector Rationalisation programme the reallocation of funding is more concentrated and geared towards critical areas such as, at risk youth. The total number of unemployed youth declined by 8 025 persons in 2017 compared with 2016.
To expand access to banking services, the National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) was launched, which aims to create the conditions in which Jamaicans, particularly those underserved by the domestic financial system: i) to save safely and build resilience against financial shocks, ii) manage irregular cash flows, iii) increase investments in entrepreneurial activities and afford basic services. 
  The policies, programmes and initiatives implemented to date are expected to further strengthen Jamaicais ability to pursue strategic priorities in agro parks, logistics hub facilities, ICT and technology parks, major tourism and resort development projects, infrastructure projects, cultural and creative industries and sport-based initiatives, urban renewal, and low- and middle-income housing. 
Challenges
Despite increasing, GDP remains below its pre-crisis levels (2007). This reflects the impact of challenges associated with uncompetitive business environment with delays in bureaucratic approval processes, complex and burdensome tax system, and high costs of capital and energy; long-term historical declines in labour productivity and total factor productivity; high levels of crime and violence that impose economic costs and discourage inward investment. 
  A major determinant to productivity and long-run growth outcomes is the quality of human capital in a country. The quality and magnitude of a developed labour force is the underpinning factor upon which good jobs and economic growth can flourish. Approximately two out of every three persons in the labour force (estimated at 1 347 600 as at October 2017) have received no formal training. The government has created a National Workforce Analysis Task Force as a first step to quantify this issue. Far more needs to be done to address the funding of tertiary education and the provision of equity-based financing for MSMEs. Inclusive growth remains elusive given the high proportion of unattached youth estimated to be as high as 175 000 persons. The social ills that plague the nation will continue until these issues are addressed. 
Goal 9 n Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation
Goal 3 of the Vision 2030 Jamaica \0xECJamaicais Economy is Prosperous and specifically \0xECOutcome 11: A Technology Enabled Society affirms a sustained focus on deepening the application of science and technology to benefit all aspects of national development and unleash the full creative potential of the people. Since 2015, strategic focus has been placed on improving the policy environment; strengthening scientific, research, development and innovation capacities; improving data

collection; promoting public-private partnerships; and promoting industrial diversification, with special emphasis on digital and bio-based industries. 
Progress and Achievements:  
Achieving an integrated policy, regulatory and institutional framework n Over the period under review, the GOJ has implemented policies, plans and initiatives all geared towards creating resilient infrastructure, promote sustainable industrialization and foster innovation.This includes the finalization of a new STI Policy, to ensure a robust, collaborative process of transformation to a knowledge-driven economy. This effort was led by the newly reinstituted National Commission on Science and Technology, acting on a broad mandate to guide policy development, facilitate STI mapping and reporting, and improve coordination within the innovation ecosystem. In term of improving market conditions, market access and improved performace in the services sector were fostered through the adoption of national standards as well as certification of public and private entities to international standards such as ISO and HACCP. Between 2015 and 2017 some 207 product and service standards were published n covering areas such as agriculture, tourism, food production, construction, manufacturing, shipping, energy and electricity, and consumer goods. As at the end of 2017, there were at least 41 companies certified to ISO 9001; 10 certified to ISO 14000; and 23 implementing food safety standards (HACCP, SQF, ISO 22000 and FSSC 2200).
Box 3: New Legislation Supporting the Application of STI Development
New Legislation Supporting the Application of STI for Development:
Nuclear Safety and Radiation Protection Act, 2015 n providing for the management of ionising radiation and nuclear technologies; 
Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) Evidence Act, 2015 n establishing a DNA register and rules for the treatment of DNA samples; 
Cybersecurity Act, 2015 n providing for criminal sanctions for computer specific offences; 
National Identification and Registration Act, 2017 n  establishing a national identification system;  
Data Protection Bill, 2017 n tabled in parliament to protect the privacy of certain information and connected matters
Advancing data-driven decision making n Preliminary data on resources allocated to R&D was collected in 20158. Public expenditure on R&D as a proportion of GDP was found to be in the region of 0.041 per cent (2014), and total headcount of researchers in the public sector was estimated to be 12219 or 0.95 per thousand labour force (among the lowest in the Latin America and Caribbean region). The results signalled the need for greater levels of public investment and strengthened the case for systematic collection of data on STI performance. Strategies were implemented to address both of these issues.

Figure 18: STI Performance Strategies, 2015npresent
Supporting domestic technology development, research and innovation n Continued emphasis on building a robust national innovation system has contributed to improved performance on the Global Innovation Index. In 2017, Jamaica ranked 84 (with a score of 30.4), compared with 96 (and 29.9) in 2015. With regards to boosting public investment in R&D, the Technological Investment Fund (TIF) was reactivated in April 2017. An initial allocation of $30.0 million was mobilized to support R&D in areas of national priority (water and indigenous knowledge systems will be the focus for 2018n2020). Local capacity in the areas of additive manufacturing and \0xEBGreenTechi development (see Goal 12) was bolstered with the opening of the Centre for Digital Innovation and Advanced Manufacturing at the Caribbean Maritime University (2017), and the Caribbean Climate Innovation
Centre: Innovation Lab (2018). The Jamaica Centre for Tourism Innovation was also launched in 2017 to facilitate the certification of personnel and stimulate innovation within the sector. The GOJ signed an MOU in 2017 with an overseas consortium to undertake a feasibility assessment towards establishing a science and technology research park in Jamaica. This partnership is to advance the thrust to grow Jamaicais share of high technology R&D outputs.
Improving access to information and communications technology n Significant strides have been made in improving and expanding ICT infrastructure and implementing ICT for Development (ICT4D) strategies. This has resulted in inter alia teledensity rates of above 100 per cent for the past ten years (ITU, 2016). There has been an upward trend in the percentage of households owning a working computer and having access to the internet, which stood at 36.7 per cent and 34.6 per cent, respectively, in 2015. Broadband connected sites (376 as at December 2016), Community Access Points (258 as at December 2016) and public Wi-Fi hotspots have been establiished islanwide, all with a view to ensuring universal and affordable internet access to citizens. In keeping with the commitment to leave no one behind, youth, seniors, and persons with disabilities received special attention through capacity-building, scholarships and the giThing of devices. ICT gains have translated to improved performance on the Networked Readiness Index (83 out of 139 countries in 2016) and ICT Development Index (98 out of 176 countries in 2017). Despite these achievements, the export share (in J$Millions) of ICT exports is low (0.3 per cent in 2015).
  E-Governance: Scores on the United Nations E-Government Development Index moved to 0.4534 in 2016 from 0.4388 in 2014 reflecting the advances made in this area.The GOJ has automated many of its processes to improve the ease of doing business in Jamaica. Key developments included: 
\0xEF the establishment of e-Gov Jamaica Limited to facilitate the necessary upgrades and guide the strategic use of ICTs across the public sector
\0xEF roll-out of e-Government services such as the: One Stop Business Registration \0xEBSuper Formi; Jamaica Customs Agency Automated System for Customs Data (ASYCUDA) World; Port Community System; and the Tax Administration Jamaica Revenue Administration Information System
\0xEF launch of the the Government Platform https://www.gov.jm/ and the Open Data Portal www.data.gov.jm to facilitate free and easy access to government data and services
  Growth of 0.5 per cent was recorded for the Transport, Storage & Communication industry in 2016.  The expansion in real value added was supported mainly by growth in the Communication sub-industry, linked to continued competition and product innovation.  Within the Transport & Storage sub-industry, there were increased activities at the islandis airports, while reductions were recorded at the sea ports. The indicators for the Transport & Storage sub-industry, relative to 2015, showed: passenger movements at the islandis international airports at 5 548 364 compared with  5 327 285; the volume of domestic cargo handled at the islands ports at 13 727 thousand tonnes relative to 15 094 thousand  tonnes; the number of ship calls at 3 586 relative to 3 397; and the number of vehicles certified fit to operate on the islandis roads at 351 260 compared with 339 625.
  Within the telecommunication segment, data at the end of 2016 showed the total number of telephone subscribers at approximately 3.6 million relative to 3.4 million at the end of December 2015. A mobile penetration rate of 120.0 per cent and a teledensity of 131.0/100 population were recorded at the end of 2016 compared with 115.0 per cent and 124.3/100 population, respectively, at the end December 2015.
Remaining Priorities
Despite the progress which has been made, Jamaicais ability to fully implement SDG 9 and indeed Goal 3 of Vision 2030 Jamaica is constrained by systemic weaknesses, including but not limited to an under-developed policy and institutional environment; low levels on investment in R&D; and a limited capacity to innovate in the main goods and services-producing sectors. Strategic focus therefore needs to be placed on education and skills development to support advanced research, innovation and the uptake of new technologies. Strengthening of national implementing institutions and mechanisms for data collection should be prioritized. There are also much which could be gained through the establishment of meaningful partnerships (North-South, SouthnSouth, and Triangular) to mobilize critical financial resources as well as to facilitate knowledge and technology transfer.
Box 4: Case Study n Highway 2000
Since 2000, the GOJ has been implementing its trans-Jamaica Highway project. Dubbed Highway 2000, the project aims to use highways to connect Kingston, with Montego Bay and Ocho Rios, passing through the parishes of Clarendon, St. Catherine, St. Ann, Manchester and proposed sections through St. James, St. Elizabeth, Westmoreland and Hanover.  According to the National Road Operating and Constructing Company (NROCC); the managers of the highway project, the main objectives of the project are:
\0xEF serving as a catalyst for economic activity
\0xEF providing direct and efficient links between the major economic centers and reducing congestion on the existing road system 
\0xEF reducing population pressures on the major urban centerscentres and facilitating commuting from suburban and rural areas 
\0xEF increasing the safety of motorists and reducing vehicle operating costs through the use of higher standards of highway design. 

  The highway is operated by the Jamaica Infrastructure Operators and developed by Trans-Jamaica Highway Limited. The highway was built on a phased basis: Phases 1A and 1B are considered as the East-West Leg (T1) and Portmore Causeway (T2); Phase 2A is considered as the North-South Leg (T3). The highway is a four-to-six lane controlled-access, tolled motorway with grade-separated interchanges and intersections built according to modern international standards. Tolling of the highway is governed by a Tolling Policy. Phase 1A of the Highway was completed in July 2006 and Phase 1B in August 2012. Section 2 (Mount Rosser Bypass) of Phase 2A of the project was completed in August 2014. Construction of Phase 2A (Sections 1 and 3) was completed during the reporting period 2015/2016, and was opened in phases; with the entire Highway opened to the public on March 23, 2016.

Figure 20: Section of Highway 2000
Goal 10 n Reduce inequality within and among countries
Jamaica has made significant strides with regard to \0xECreducing inequalities by virtue of an improved macro-economic outlook in 201610,11, which translates into corresponding improvements in the social sector which augurs well for the achievement of the targets within Goal 10 in relation to gender equality, persons living with disabilities and facilitating effective migration management and the promulgation of inclusive social protection coverage. The policies, programmes and plans undertaken in support of the achievement of Vision 2030 Jamaica and advancing SDG 10 are outlined below.
Highlights of Achievements 
\0xEF The Social Enterprise Business Model was identified as a suitable model to address issues of inequality and specifically to advance and achieve sustained income growth of businesses in the most vulnerable and volatile communities across Jamaica. The GOJ executed the Social Enterprise Boost Initiative (SEBI), which was designed to assist organizations operating within the social enterprise sector to become income generating and self-sustaining, and to show through applicable methodology that social enterprises can be profitable businesses. SEBI is a project of the Jamaica National Foundation and is being implemented in collaboration with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). SEBI began in 2012 as a three year initiative, but was expanded for two additional years from December 2015 to December 2017. Key achievements emerging from SEBI to date includes: 
over 75 social enterprises benefiting from Incubator services and JN Open Network session, which have built their business capacities, thus helping them to scale up their businesses and increase their knowledge of social \0x221E direct spending on the incubator of approximately JA$30.0 million so far and enterprise within the business ecosystem 
\0x221E establishment of a Social Enterprise Policy Committee in 2015, to guide the will go up to over $60.0 million by year end 2018 development or inclusion of social enterprise within a policy framework.
\0xEF During 2016, the Jamaica Council for Persons with Disabilities (JCPD) collaborated with its parent ministry and other partners in support of promulgation of rights of persons living with disabilities and the creation of enabling client-friendly systems and environments for the 30 625 persons registered as having a disability at yearnend12. 
\0xEF For the fiscal year, 2018n2019, with support provided through the European Unionis Technical Cooperation Facility V Project, Jamaica will be developing building design plans to allow members of the disabled community to access the islandis courts more easily13. 
\0xEF The National Policy for Senior Citizens (2018) was approved as a Green Paper in 2018 and presents the governmentis commitment to broad inclusion of senior citizens in nation building.
\0xEF The GOJ in the financial year 2016/2017 focussed on the provision of welfare and safety nets for the most vulnerable in the society through four (4) major
\0x221E GOJ/World Bank Social Protection Project projects14:
\0x221E\0x221E The GOJ/IDB Integrated Social Protection and Labour Programme \0x221E The GOJ/WB Support to the Socio-economic Inclusion of Persons with The GOJ/IDB Integrated Support to the Social Protection Strategy
Disabilities. 
  These four (4) projects complemented each other and provided support in the form of cash transfers, training and other critical resources to vulnerable populations including poor children and persons with disabilities, and were executed through the Ministry of Labour and Social Security.
\0xEF In 2016, Jamaica benefited from ODA assistance amounting to US$359.9 million ($45.0 billion). Assistance from Multilateral Financial Institutions (MFIs) totalled US$226.5 million ($28.3 billion).
\0xEF For 2016, remittance inflows totalled US$2 291 million15. Remittances contribute to national development, not solely based on the size of flows and their impact on the country, but also on the role of remittances in the development of the Jamaican financial sector. 
Lesson Learned
As it relates to effective migration management, Jamaica since 2011 has also established a National Working Group on International Migration and Development
Box 5: Case Study n Mainstreaming Migration into National Development Strategies
Jamaica is one of eight countries participating in Phase 2 of the Joint Global IOM/UNDP Mainstreaming Migration into National Development Strategies Programme which is being funded by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) and coordinated jointly by the United Nations Development Programme and the International Organization for Migration (IOM).  This project provided financial and technical assistance in support of the development of a number of achievements in the area of Migration and Development in Jamaica:
\0xEF National Policy on International Migration and Development (IMD) approved as a White Paper by Cabinet on January 16, 2017 and was subsequently laid in Parliament in June 2017.  
\0xEF Development and operationalization of a national migration database in October 2017. 
\0xEF 2018 Extended Migration Profile was completed and officially launched by the Government in January 2018. 
\0xEF Development of a Plan of Action in support of the reintegration and rehabilitation of forced returnees (involuntary returned migrants) in April 2017.  
n multi-sectoral working group comprised of over 30 entities (government, private sector and civil society actors) and four (4) sub-committees. The NWGIMD is an inter-agency group that coordinates the execution of the nationis migration-related mandates. The NWGIMD has been instrumental in the formulation of Jamaicais and the regionis first National Policy on International Migration and Development and continues to serve as the pillar for the mainstreaming processes necessary to facilitate successful policy implementation. The NWGIMD meets quarterly or as is deemed appropriate. The NWGIMD objectives are to: (a) provide policy and technical advice on migration and development to Cabinet, MDAs and other stakeholders; and (b) operate as a standing committee to oversee the implementation and monitoring of policy actions geared towards the mainstreaming of migration into national and sub-national development strategies. 
Challenges 
The ability of the GOJ to implement and achieve Goal 10 and its targets will require significant resource mobilization from international development partners, the private sector and other development stakeholders. 
  Another critical challenge in the implementation of the SDGs in Jamaica, and particularly Goal 10, is the need to find innovative financing mechanisms for critical investments to support adequate social protection provisioning as underpinned by the National Social Protection Strategy, 2014. 
An important challenge to achieving this goal is ensuring that no one is leTh behind
in the process. Despite important efforts to reach the poorest of the poor, it is important to recognize that some groups still face significant barriers to improved well-being. Some groups that were referred to during consultations include: rural women, youth, crime-ridden communities, workers in the informal sector, agricultural workers, the elderly and PWDs16. 
  Among the greatest challenges for these groups are their low participation in social protection programmes, even when they are eligible, particularly among agricultural workers and informal workers; high risk and cost of non-communicable diseases; and difficulties entering the labour force, particularly among women and youth.
Goal 11 n Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable
Jamaica has experienced gradual urbanization for the past decade. An estimated 54.0 per cent of the population currently lives in urban areas and the development of growth centres has been observed outside of main cities which traditionally contained the majority of the urban population17. With an estimated annual increase of 1.3 per cent per annum, the urban population is projected to be 1 528 143 in 2020 and 1 869 272 in 203018. Despite the opportunities presented by urbanization and the strides made towards development, urban centres in Jamaica continue to face challenges especially as it relates to sustainable growth.

Access to Adequate, Safe and Affordable Housing, Basic Services and Upgrading of Slums 
Policies and Plans:
\0xEF The Mortgage Bank Act was amended to facilitate the reduction in down payments from a 10.0n15.0 per cent band to 3.0 per cent.
\0xEF Work commenced on the development of a National Squatter Management Policy and Implementation Plan and a National Resettlement Strategy has been draThed towards a planned approach for the relocation from vulnerable settlements.
\0xEF In 2017, the GOJ launched the Housing, Opportunity, Production and Employment (H.O.P.E) Programme, which is, anticipated to assist with the provision of shelter through the housing component. 
\0xEF In 2015, the GOJ launched a National Land Titling Programme geared towards improving security of tenure. The Land Administration and Management Programme (LAMP) and the National Land Agency (NLA) were also merged in 2018 to jointly address tenure regularization, land adjudication, registration and administration. 
Key Achievements:
\0xEF Jamaica has a high Housing Quality Index16 (HQI) n 72.2 per cent of the housing stock is considered to be of an acceptable quality17 (Table 5). HQI in the KMA was 78.5 per cent and 73.6 per cent in Other Towns.
\0xEF Through direct targeting of the reduction of the housing deficit, housing finance policies have since 2015 resulted in 4 491 housing starts and 3 802 housing completions. 
\0xEF In 2017, the National Housing Trust (NHT) introduced lower mortgage rates specifically targeting minimum wage earners/low earning contributors, as well as persons with disabilities (PWDs) under the Home Grants Programme. 
\0xEF NHT in 2017, introduced increased housing loan limits for first time home owners, more accessible construction loans, increased scheme affordability and deferred mortgages. 
\0xEF Through partnership agreement between the LAMP and the USAID-funded Building Resilience and Capacities against Emerging Disasters (BRACED) Project in Naggo Head, St. Catherine; the process has begun for clarification and regularization of 300 parcels of land.

\0xEF Government led and sponsored programmes under the Jamaica Social Investment Fund as well as Community Renewal Programme have been facilitating service delivery as a component of shelter provision in areas such as road rehabilitation & storm water drainage, installation of water supply and sanitation household connections, solid waste management, electricity regularization, and zinc fence removal. In addition, the CRP has facilitated the development of participatory action and coordinating frameworks for socioeconomic and psycho-social interventions among targeted communities that are considered vulnerable and volatile. Under these frameworks, partner agencies are implementing programmes in targetted communities spanning the areas of education/training, business development, behavioural change and strengthening of the governance structures and capacity among the residents.
Remaining Priorities:
\0xEF There is an insufficient supply of housing to meet demand; a net annual deficit of approximately 6 200 units18. Issues such as high housing finance costs and the burdensome land administration processes have contributed to the proliferation of informal settlements which tend to be located in vulnerable or environmentally sensitive areas. 
Access to Safe, Affordable, Sustainable Transport Systems
Public transportation in urban areas is provided primarily by buses and taxis which are a mix of private and publicly-owned vehicles such as the Jamaica Urban Transit Company (JUTC) and the Montego Bay Metro Company Limited. Relevant actions taken or strengthened during the period under review includes: 
Policies and Plans:
\0xEF A new Road Traffic Act was passed and includes an outline of new offences, increased penalties and restrictions on handheld devices.
Key Achievements:
\0xEF The continued drive to improve access and affordability supports actions such as the offering of specialized services for PWDs. This includes augmenting the fleet with buses custom designed and allotted to the disabled community in Kingston along with specially designated seats on regular JUTC buses at a concessionary fee. Improved access to the JUTC buses was also facilitated through the construction of liThs and ramps for the Half-Way-Tree Transportation Center19. Concessionary fares are also offered to other groups such as students and the elderly. In September 2017, the JUTC expanded its services with the roll out of some 450 buses per day and started a six-month pilot test of a rural-urban transport service. There was also the launch of the JUTCis Google transit app which helps commuters to readily access information on bus routes, schedules and fares from any electronic device.
\0xEF The Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF) launched a Road Safety Hub in collaboration with the Mona Geo-Informatics Institute in November 2017, towards improving safety on the roads. The hub is to assist in the development of better informed road-safety policies and programmes through provision of traffic data (real time road crash and network data). The integration of geospatial technologies and services is expected to improve data collection and analysis while adding value to how policies and interventions related to traffic management are developed and implemented. The hub will assist the police force in getting information which can help to prevent accidents. 
\0xEF A vulnerability assessment of the transport system in Jamaica was also completed in 2018, which examines the vulnerability of the transport sectoris assets to weather, climate variability and climate change and will aid in resilience building.
\0xEF Since 2013, the Jamaican government has been implementing its Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) project; the first of its kind on the island. The pilot project is currently housed at the National Works Agency (NWA) in its Traffic Management Unit. The aims of the ITS are to use transportation technology to automate the operations of traffic signals; improve the ability to detect and respond to incidents, such as disabled vehicles; and to improve coordination between the traffic management and traffic enforcement agencies
Waste Management and Air Quality 
Waste management has presented an ongoing challenge for urban centers. Nationally, the total volume of waste collected through formal collection systems was 797 122 tonnes with an estimated per capita waste generation of 1.2 kg/day3. Waste output is expected to increase to 1.5 kg/day per person subject to the influence of factors such as population increase, changes in consumption patterns, technological changes and economy modernization20.
Policies and Regulatory Framework:
\0xEF Efforts have also been made to advance the National Waste Management Policy and Strategy for Jamaica and a pre-feasibility study was conducted between 2016 and 2017. The study was undertaken with the objective to develop a comprehensive Solid Waste Management (SWM) programme which is to provide for more private sector involvement and to enhance the overall solid waste management service quality. 
\0xEF Since 2014, the NSWMA has been working closely with the Chief Parliamentary Council and relevant stakeholders to finalize and promulgate regulations on waste management and pollution. 
\0xEF Revision of the Motor Vehicle Emissions Standards towards improving air quality.
\0xEF Development of a DraTh Emissions Policy Framework and expansion of the national Air Quality Monitoring Network which has \0xECenhanced the capacity to monitor the impact of anthropogenic sources of air pollution on ambient air quality and to report on changes in air quality during pollution incidents21. 
Key Achievements:
\0xEF In 2015, approximately 70.4 per cent of households in urban areas disposed of waste via regular collection system and of the 2.9 per cent of households that utilized municipal sites, more than half (54.9 per cent) were urban22. 
\0xEF A public education campaign entitled \0xECNuh Dutty Up Jamaica led by the Jamaica
Environment Trust (JET) with the support of the Tourism Enhancement Fund (TEF) and the Wisynco Group, was launched to improve knowledge about the impact of poorly handled waste on public health and the environment, while encouraging personal responsibility for waste generation and disposal. 
\0xEF A fire suppression system has been installed at the Riverton Disposal Site23 as a means of mitigating the effects in the event of a fire. 
\0xEF In a bid to improve air quality, a UNEP Global Fuel Economy Initiative (GFEI) project was launched in 2015 to promote more efficient fuels and to stabilize emissions. Project outputs to date include a report on fuel economy trends in Jamaica.
Disaster Risk Reduction and Alignment with Sendai Framework24
Jamaica has also faced the challenges associated with its vulnerability to natural hazards. By virtue of its topography and location in the Atlantic hurricane belt, the island is exposed to hurricanes, landslides, floods, droughts and earthquakes. Climate variability has manifested primarily in hydro-meteorological events which are estimated to have cost approximately $128 billion worth of loss and damage between the years 2000 and 201725, accompanied by significant impacts on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as well as on towns and their populations in areas such as housing, power delivery, water services and labour productivity. Relevant plans and policies and key achievements within disaster reduction are highlighted below. 
Policies and Plans:
\0xEF Promulgation of the Disaster Risk Management Act (2015) which complemented the National Disaster Fund which contains $350.0 million to facilitate mitigation, preparedness, early response and disaster recovery. 
\0xEF Passage of the Building Act (2018), intended to facilitate the revision and adoption of the National Building Code and is intended to inter alia ensure public safety and improve the resilience of the countryis built environment.
\0xEF Climate Change Policy Framework and Action Plan (2015) which is designed to mainstream climate change in national policies and development planning.
Key Achievements:
\0xEF Hazard risk reduction and climate change adaptation are critical outcomes being pursued under Vision 2030 Jamaica. To this end, the Government has since 2007, pursued risk financing measures by purchasing insurance coverage under the Parametric Insurance Policy with the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility Segregated Portfolio Company (CCRIF SPC) with coverage for financial year 2016/2017 amounting to US$ 154.5 million. The policy provides insurance coverage for tropical cyclones, earthquake damage and excess rainfall26. 
\0xEF Reconstitution of the Disaster Risk Management Council 
\0xEF Establishment of a Climate Change Division and Advisory Committee along with several projects such as the Jamaica Disaster Vulnerability Reduction Project (JDVRP) 
\0xEF Implementation of the Pilot Programme for Climate Resilience (PPCR) and the GOJ/Adaptation Fund Programme, all aimed at disaster risk reduction and climate change resilience building. 
\0xEF The Building Disaster Resilient Communities (BDRC) Programme has pursued resilience activities in over 200 of the islandis most vulnerable communities. 
\0xEF Capacity building activities to, inter alia, improve monitoring and response to seismic activity have been undertaken under the four-year Jamaica Disaster Vulnerability Reduction Project and it is anticipated that three new fire stations will be constructed under the project.
\0xEF The Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM) pursued earthquake resilience activities in schools by installing seismographs and training teachers in the management of the equipment. 
\0xEF A tsunami warning siren has also been installed by the ODPEM in Old Harbour Bay and it is anticipated that three other such instruments will be installed across the island in 2018. 
\0xEF The training of 117 volunteers in, inter alia, disaster risk management, initial damage assessment and shelter management, and the development of a National Disaster Risk Management Volunteers Database. The database has been developed to streamline the deployment of volunteers post-disaster, and currently has 1 165 registered volunteers.
\0xEF Preliminary work on the development of a National Risk Information Platform and a Climate Data Node to promote data sharing and facilitate collaboration across the Government of Jamaica. 
\0xEF Disaster Risk Information Platform (DRIP) developed for the parish of St. Catherine as a disaster risk reduction tool. 
\0xEF A National Emergency Response Geographic Information Systems Team (NERGIST) has also been trained in the use of the USAID IDA/DANA methodology for performing initial damage assessment. The team of volunteers has been deployed post local and regional disaster events. 
\0xEF The capacity of 87 disaster risk management professionals was strengthened through training in Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA)
\0xEF In response to the vulnerability of the islandis health facilities to natural hazards and climate change, the government through partnership with PAHO/WHO has embarked on a Smart Hospitals Strategy. Some 100 health facilities across the island have been selected for assessment within the next 4n5 years. There are also plans to conduct a health sector vulnerability assessment and prepare a costed resilience strengthening plan under the Improving Climate Data and Information Management Project.
\0xEF The boosting of Jamaicais emergency communication capacity through a $1.6 billion grant from the Government of Japan to implement the Improvement of Emergency Communication System Project. The project will see the development of a platform for communications among Government MDAs involved in the DRM process, major stakeholders, auxiliary services and community volunteers. The grant will also facilitate the procurement of radio equipment, transmission and reception devices to response entities and for critical locations.
Participatory, Integrated, Sustainable Human Planning and National Regional Development Planning
Efforts have also been made towards strengthening national and regional development planning. This is captured in Vision 2030 Jamaica Outcome 15 n Sustainable Urban and Rural Development n strategies which speak to among other things, ensuring that development decisions are guided by a spatial planning framework (national physical plan); as well as improving citizen participation in decision making through full implementation of the Local Sustainable Development Planning (LSDP) Framework. 
  Of note has been the advancement of local government reform with the 2016 passage of the Local Governance Act; Local Government (Unified Service and Employment) Act; and the Local Government (Financing and Financial Management) Act. This pivotal move \0xECprovides for establishment of a framework to accommodate the various types of local authorities; expand their mandate to include sustainable development and the maintenance of civic order; create accountability and transparency mechanisms for local authorities; define the role and relationship between the administrative and political organs of local authorities; and empower civil society and communities in the governance process27.
  Further to this action and in alignment with the national development strategies, work has commenced on the development of a National Spatial Plan which will inter alia outline spatial planning guidelines for national and regional development as well as set the national context for spatial planning at the regional and local level. Work to date has included review of the National Settlement Strategy as well as the updating of planning discussion papers in seven thematic areas that are expected to ultimately inform development of the spatial plan. 
  The National Spatial Plan is complemented by the promulgation of Development Orders28 and Local Sustainable Development Plans29 (LSDPs). The process for creating them is inclusive, taking into account population and other development trends such as growth centres and urban hubs. Efforts are ongoing to update existing Development Orders with four confirmed in 2015 and to date an additional eight promulgated as DraThs or awaiting promulgation. There are six LSDPs completed and three in draTh stage. Funding for the development of LSDPs remains a challenge. 
Goal 12 n Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns
The principle of sustainable consumption and production (SCP) has been at the heart of the global sustainable development agenda since it was prioritized at the United Nations, Rio Earth Summit in 1992 and enshrined in Principle 8 of Agenda 21. Of note then, and still relevant today is the fact that achieving sustainable patterns of consumption and production requires strategic interventions at the policy level which promote sustainable and inclusive growth whilst minimizing negative ecological impacts. Concepts such as the green economy, circular economy, and ecoefficiency and low carbon development which embody these SCP principles are an essential part of the Jamaican sustainability paradigm and are echoed throughout Vision 2030 Jamaica, and in particular Goals 3 and 4; Jamaicais Economy is Prosperous and Jamaica has a Healthy Natural Environment, which promotes, among other things, the sustainable management and use of environmental and natural resources. 
Policy, Planning and Regulatory Framework 
Through national policy and planning frameworks such as the National Energy Policy (2009n2030), National Food and Nutrition Policy (2013), Climate Change Policy Framework for Jamaica (2015), Water Sector Policy (2018), Forest Policy for Jamaica (2017),Government of Jamaica Public Sector Procurement Policy (2010) &
Environmental Guide to Green Procurement, Ministry of Industry, Commerce, Agriculture & Fisheries Strategic Business Plan (2017n2021), and the 5 in 4 Call to Action30 the government, in tandem with industry, civil society, communities, and households have committed to pursuing inter alia: sustainable and efficient use of natural resources, renewable energy development, energy efficiency and conservation, minimization of waste and emissions, optimization of production processes, and the adoption of clean technologies to spur sustainable industrial development (see relevant chapters of the report for progress in these areas). 
  A major catalyst for the global pursuit to ensure SCP patterns has been the 10 Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns (10YFP) that emerged out of the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation (JPOI) at the World Summit of Sustainable Development (WSSD). Jamaica participated in the first meeting of the Executive Committee of the Regional Council of Government Experts on Sustainable Consumption and Production for Latin America and the Caribbean in 2014, out of which emerged a new Regional Strategy and Action Plan 2015n16 for SCP. Notably, a concrete outcome from this regional strategy has been the focus on supporting Small and Medium Sized enterprises in meeting the goal of sustainable consumption and production in LAC. Jamaica is also among 20 countries in the region which has appointed a 10YFP focal point which sits at the National Environment and Planning Agency. 
  The 10YFP Trust Fund is one of the means of implementation of the 10YFP which seeks to provide support to assist developing countries and countries in transition to advance towards SCP patterns. To date, Jamaicais submission of proposals for funding under the 10 YFP Trust Fund, most notably in the area of sustainable tourism, has not been successful. 
Progress and Achievements
Attaining economic growth whilst sustainably utilizing natural resourcesi, of necessity, requires an endorsement of the principle of \0xEBdecouplingi growth from environmental degradation and resource use intensity. A primary approach applied to this end in Jamaica has been the drive to incorporate environment considerations into both public and private sector decision making and to promote the application of environmental stewardship principles (ES) and strategic environmental assessments (SEA) in the operations of government. In this regard, policies for the adoption of each of the above environmental management tools exist (albeit as draTh policies), with ES and SEA being specifically geared to enhance public sector efficiency in resource use and to ensure the integration of evaluation techniques for sustainable environmental management. In addition national standards have been published on an ongoing basis to promote the implementation of Environmental Management Systems (EMS) and to improve environmental performance across various sectors. These include standard specifications related to: the phased implementation of EMS; environmental performance evaluation; carbon footprint of products; and life cycle assessment. As at the end of 2017, at least 10 companies were certified to ISO 14000 environmental management standards.
  SDG 12 provides a major focus on addressing food waste through sustainable agricultural practices and supply chain management (12.3); Life-cycle management of chemicals and all wastes to minimize public and environmental health impacts (12.4); and substantially reducing waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and re-use (12.5). 
  Activities towards the reduction of food losses along production and supply chains included monitoring and control processes, investment in post harvesting infrastructure and capacity building. Among the supporting priority programmes of the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, Agriculture and Fisheries (MICAF) is the Agro-Parks & Agricultural Economic Zones (Agro-Parks Development) Programme. This speaks to the development of Agricultural Economic Zones (AEZs) as an extension of the G0Jis Agro-Parks Development Programme. These AEZs will seek to integrate all facets of the agricultural value chain from pre-production to production, post-harvesting and marketing. In keeping with this priority, approximately $530.6 million was expended to provide infrastructural works such as irrigation equipment, post-harvesting facilities, farm access ways, drains and sanitation facilities to complete the operationalization of nine Agro-Parks under the IDB-funded Agricultural Competitiveness Programme (ACP); post-harvest characterization studies for selected crops were completed in collaboration with the University of the West Indies; and banana production increased by 6.2 per cent in 2015, due primarily to the Jamaica Banana Accompanying Measures Programme which provided farmers with training and technology transfer in various aspects of production and post-harvest management. 
  A reduction in post-harvest losses at the sub-national level is being realised with the construction of the $21.5 million Jamaica Cocoa Farmers Drying Facility and the $19.5 million St. Mary Multi-purpose Cooperative Cold Storage Facility. The former will enable over 225 cocoa farmers in the parishes of Portland, St. Mary and St. Thomas to reduce post-harvest losses and increase market access for Jamaicais premium cocoa, while the latter resulted in the reduction of post-harvest losses from 30.0 per cent to 6.0 per cent. 
  The Food Storage and Prevention of Infestation Division (FSPID), an external Department of MICAF, is responsible for the provision of food and for the prevention of loss of food by infestation. In addition to carrying out routine inspections, disinfestation operations and laboratory analyses, the Training and Information Unit of the FSPID conducted and/or coordinated 10 training programmes in food storage, integrated pest management and fumigation for FSPID staff, pest management professionals, food industry personnel, university students, Jamaica Agriculture Society parish officers, and public health inspectors. Initiatives towards the reduction of food losses are expected to continue as among the principal focus of the Division for 2017/2018 is the prevention of contamination of food/feed reaching the public and the enhancement of food security by preventing and/or reducing spoilage/waste.
  SDG 12 is also closely related to SDGs 6 and 11, which respectively seek to improve water quality and reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities through effective pollution prevention and waste management (see relevant chapters of this report). Among the milestones achieved since the adoption of the SDGs is the execution of preparatory activities and ratification, in 2017, of the Minamata Convention on Mercury (see Figure 22). This global agreement aims to protect human health and the environment from the risks associated with exposure to mercury. Preparatory activities have commenced to enable Jamaicais ratification of the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer n which will see a phase done in the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which have been proven to be powerful GHGs. This is expected to be achieved through strengthening the legal and regulatory framework; harmonizing custom codes with new series of pure and blended (HFCs); and enhancing public education/awareness of the Amendment and its implications.
  Implementation of national activities (between 2014 and 2017) in furtherance of the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM) yielded a number of important deliverables. Chief among these were draThing instructions for overarching chemicals management legislation; draThing of \0xECtake back legislation for electronic and electrical waste (e-wastes); updating of the National Chemicals Management Profile document; development of a National Chemical Emergency Risk Management Plan; inventories completed for priority chemicals (mercury and asbestos); capacity building of public and private sector entities in Hazardous Waste Operations Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) and asbestos abatement; and the execution of a pilot project for the environmentally sound management of e-wastes in selected communities within St. Catherine, Kingston and St. Andrew.

Figure 22: Strengthening of the Regulatory Framework for Chemical and Waste Management
  Several initiatives are being undertaken or planned to improve eco-efficiency and improve environmental performance in the private sector. This includes the launch of a Green Business Jamaica Certification (GBJ) Programme in 2017, which targets improved energy efficiency and conservation, use of new and clean technologies and fostering greater levels of compliance with national and international environmental standards. With specific emphasis on the micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSME) sector, the EcoMicro Caribbean Project (2016n2020) valued at CA$7.2 million, was launched to support the development of green financial products in partnership with microfinance institutions. This project is intended to increase access to clean and efficient energy products and services by MSMEs and low-income households in the Caribbean. In addition, the Closed Loop Cycle Production in the Americas Programme: Jamaican Green Cluster Economy (2016n2017) was approved with financing of US$30 000. This project is intended to support the transition toward a sustainable economy that employs renewable energy, eliminates the use of harmful chemicals and materials, and reduces waste at all stages of the value chain. The opening of an Innovation Lab under the auspices of the Caribbean Climate Change Innovation Centre31 provides a space for \0xEBcleani technology development and incubation of \0xEBGreenTechi start-ups. The facility supports start-ups in the areas of energy efficiency, renewable energy, sustainable agri-business, water/waste management and resource use efficiency.
  There are a number of ongoing initiatives targetted at raising awareness for sustainable development and lifestyles in harmony with nature, including the implementation of environmental public awareness campaigns and the observance of special days related to the preservation of environmental resources. Among the initiatives are the Jamaica Million Tree Challenge, a national initiative that encourages Jamaicans to plant a tree to improve the islandis natural biodiversity, green coverage and overall resilience to the impacts of climate change; and the National Tree Planting Day (NTPD), a public awareness initiative that seeks contribute to an increase in the islandis forest cover by engaging the public in the act of tree planting.
  A number of projects being implemented with the assistance of international development partners also have components targetted at improving public awareness of key SD issues. Hundreds of farmers, for example, have been educated in the use of climate-smart agriculture methodologies using the farmer field school technique32. In addition, the country hosts a Climate Change Division, within the Ministry of Economic Growth and Job Creation; a Climate Change Focal Point Network, which is focused on infusing climate change considerations into the policies, plans and programmes of all sectors; as well as the Climate Studies Group Mona, in the Department of Physics at the University of the West Indies, which provides data and analyses of climate change impacts on the country. This research capacity has been reinforced by specific studies on climate change scenarios up to 2100 (2012 and 2015) {State of the Jamaican Climate} and studies on the impact of climate change on agriculture in Jamaica recently completed by the UNECLAC and the FAO. As such Jamaica has a reasonably good knowledge base to drive its practices in support of Targets 12.3 and related Goal 2, Target 2.4. This is complemented by the long standing effort to mainstream Sustainable Development issues in the national curriculum, through the National Committee on Sustainable Development, which is in line with Target 12.8. In addition, the country intends to improve the availability and accessibility of information related to climate change and disaster risk management and climate change awareness significantly through (i) the development of national platforms for climate and disaster risk information and (ii) an extensive communications campaign recently launched under the countryis Pilot Programme for Climate Resilience.
  The Tourism Linkages Network was established to forge linkages and increase the production and consumption of locally made goods and services in the tourism sector. To achieve this objective, a Tourism Linkage Taskforce was established in 2012, subsequently a Tourism Linkage Hub was established in 2013 to achieve a higher degree of integration and increase the impact of tourism on the economy, focusing on strategies to strengthen the local value chain with agriculture, manufacturing, entertainment and sport. This is critical, as Jamaica continues to perform exceptionally well in enhancing its tourism product. The extent to which other industries can benefit, will lead to stronger growth rates in the country.  The Tourism Linkages Network is supported by a Tourism Linkages Council, comprising public- and private-sector partners to oversee the coordination and implementation of effective and sustainable strategies, to strengthen and facilitate linkages.  
  In commemoration of 2017 as the International Year of Sustainable Tourism for Development, the Government of Jamaica partnered local, regional and international partners33 to stage the UN World Tourism Organization Conference on \0xECJobs and Inclusive Growth: Partnerships for Sustainable Tourism. The conference was a medium for knowledge-sharing among stakeholders; and to present ideas about ways to sustainably develop the sector given global disrupters, such as climate change and advancements in digital technology. Furthermore, the connection between tourism development in the Caribbean and the preservation of the natural environment in determining the future of the industry featured prominently. As a direct result of the Conference, a recommendation for the establishment of a \0xEBGlobal Centre for Tourism Resilience and Crisis Managementi at the UWI, Mona Jamaica was proposed. The Centre will be designed to operate in a global context that is characterized by new challenges and opportunities for tourism in an effort to improve the tourism product as well as to ensure the sustainability of tourism globally. This Centre represents hope and assured continuity of tourism as a local and regional product and as a global enterprise. The ultimate purpose of the Centre therefore is to assist destination preparedness, management and recovery from disruptions and/or crisis that impact tourism and threaten economies and livelihoods globally.
Remaining Priorities
Jamaica is distinguished by having a clear vision, complemented by a set of policies, policy initiatives and legislative framework, plus several planning agencies geared towards managing the environment sustainably and natural resources efficiently. There, however, remain gaps in this architecture and the need to more clearly articulate linkages that must be sustained for the transition to a green economy. In addition, the challenges of financing the multiple institutions concerned with environmental governance and resource efficiency; coordinating amongst MDAis and having a clear assignment of functions and leadership responsibilities, plus ensuring that they are adequately staffed with the relevant skill sets to achieve and ensure effective monitoring and evaluation on the basis of current national and proposed sustainable development indicators, are yet to be overcome to improve the sustainable management of the environment in Jamaica.(See chapters on Goals 13, 14 and 15 for detailed information).
Goal 13 n Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts
Scientific and anecdotal evidence are clear, Jamaica is experiencing climate change. This is manifested in several ways, from increasing temperatures to changes in rainfall patterns, frequency of extreme events and sea level rise. As an example, heavy rains between March to June 2017 resulted in the loss of one life and damage and loss totalling US$31 million (0.2 per cent of 2016 GDP).
  Recognising its climate sensitivity, the country has undertaken climate action to build resilience, from advancing the policy, planning and legislative frameworks, to conducting research and managing data for evidence decision-making, and importantly, implementing key activities within priority sectors. There are also several initiatives to build the capacity of the government, citizens, private sector, civil society and others in understanding and responding to climate change.

Figure 23: Steps taken to mitigate the impact of climate change
Highlights
The promulgation of the Climate Change Framework for Jamaica, 2015 was a key achievement as it seeks to integrate climate change in the development planning process through a coordinated and streamlined approach. Its implementation will be further supported by the Climate Change Focal Point Network comprising government ministries, departments and agencies; and the Climate Change Advisory Board. Also among the achievements is the Disaster Risk Management Act, 2015 which enhances the coordination of disaster management in Jamaica. It makes provisions for the designation of Specially Vulnerable Areas and Disaster Areas to improve disaster prevention and response, among others. 
  Through partnerships with academia, Jamaica continued to produce downscaled climate scenarios for the country. Under the PPCR, the 2015 State of the Jamaican Climate, including a main report and a summary for policy makers, was among the channels used for disseminating projections for use by decision makers and the general public. Other achievements supported by projects and programmes are outlined in Box 6.
Box 6: Highlights of Achievements of Selected Projects and Programmes
Pilot Programme for Climate Resilience (PPCR) 
\0xEF Improving Climate Data and Information Management Project (ICDIMP): installation of real-time data collection system n 17 rainfall gauges, 14 streamflow gauges and 1 sea level tidal gauge n in addition to 34 automatic weather stations installed to support effective data collection as well as hydro-meteorological early-warning systems.

\0xEF Submission of the first-ever Biennial Update Report (BUR) to the UNFCCC, detailing emissions and sinks for greenhouse gases, and was the first small island state to do so
\0xEF Deposition of the instrument of accession to the Statute of the Small Island Developing States Dock (SIDS DOCK) 2017, that will facilitate access to, and leveraging of resources and technical assistance, capacity-building, technology transfer, and promotion of partnerships, to enable the successful implementation of critical sustainable energy, climate change mitigation and adaptation projects.
Challenges and the Way Forward
The Government is seized with the need for sustained climate action and remains committed to pursuing appropriate measures. In so doing, it continues to explore opportunities that will build on the progress made, particularly implementing meaningful, scaled up and sustainable climate action across sectors/industries. Efforts are underway to develop and implement policies, strategies and plans that are \0xEBclimate proofedi by taking climate change and variability into consideration. 
  Nonetheless, the extent to which meaningful progress in these areas will be possible depends on the financial and technical resources available and accessible, whether within its coffers or through partnerships. As a highly indebted, upper middle income country, the adequacy of financial resources remains a challenge, particularly as there is need to balance the \0xECbread and butter (day to day) needs of the country with the short to long-term and capital intensive demands of climate change. Nonetheless, every effort is being made to maximise on partnerships with the citizenry, non-State actors (including community groups, private sector entities and academia), the international community, and donors can build resilience to climate change in a holistic manner. 
Goal 14 n Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development
The health and vitality of Jamaicais coastal and marine resources have been a priority of successive governments, particularly given the enormous potential contained in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) that is some 21 times the size of the land. The importance of marine and coastal resources is evident across key industries, among

1.
Strengthening of the national policy and legislative frameworks governing protected areas, including marine protected areas n through the finalization of the Cays Management Policy, development of a new policy for protected areas, and the promulgation of overarching protected areas legislation by December 2020.
2.
Expansion of maritime area declared as marine protected area under national legislation n aimed at increasing maritime areas declared as marine protected area under national legislation by an estimated 2.0 per cent by 2019. 
them agriculture (and fisheries) and tourism. It has been estimated that about 90.0 per cent of the countryis GDP is generated within the coastal areas, and about 60.0 per cent of the population currently resides within 5km of the coast. The main ecosystems \0xF3 coral reefs, seagrass beds, mangroves and other wetlands \0xF3 play an integral role in \0xEClife below water; selected benefits are demonstrated in the graph below.
  The problems plaguing the coastal and marine resources of the island are twofold. On one hand, climate change has effected sea level rise and increased sea surface temperatures (SST), and also generated stronger storm surges. The problems associated with anthropogenic factors stem from pollution as well as illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing in Jamaicais territorial waters34. The resultant effects are evident in continued beach erosion (~7 per cent across selected beaches in 2017), \0xECpoor health of coral reefs35, and a decline in the biomass and density of fish, among others. Efforts aimed at building the resilience of the ecosystems are ongoing and selected achievements outlined below.
Highlights of Achievements
\0xEF Legislation and Enforcement n Among the legislative advancements made since 2015, is the Fishing Industry Act, 2015 which includes, among other things, an increase in penalties to deter future offences. In support of the Act, the fleet of boats was expanded by four in 2017 in partnership with the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative. New legislation is currently being finalised to further

Figure 24: Economic benefits derived from Coastal and Marine Ecosystems
strengthen the institutional arrangements for fisheries management and tackle IIU fishing. 
\0xEF Planning frameworks n The planning landscape benefited from the finalisation of the Beach Restoration and Coastal Guidelines in 2017, and the update of the Queen Conch Management Plan in 2016. Important also was the finalisation of the National Strategy and Action Plan on Biological Diversity in Jamaica, 2016n2021 which was submitted to the UN Convention on Biodiversity (CBD).
\0xEF Protected Areas n Marine areas under protection was increased with the designation of three Special Fisheries Conservation Areas (SFCAs)36 since 2015. 
\0xEF Data and Information Collection and Management n The monitoring of SST is being undertaken in selected locations islandwide, which is being used to track the response of coastal ecosystems, particularly coral reefs, to climatic changes. Other sets of data being monitored relate to fish biomass, beach width and status of coral reefs as well as socio-economic data relating to the users and beneficiaries of coastal and marine resources.
\0xEF Regulated fisheries n This applies primarily to the Queen Conch and spiny lobster which account for the largest share of exports and are regulated through open and closed seasons. The production of marine fish (for local consumption and export) averaged about 13 500 tonnes over the past three years (2015n2017). 
\0xEF International Commitments n One of the main achievements was the submission of Jamaicais instrument of ratification to the Protocol Concerning Pollution from Land-Based Sources and Activities (or the LBS Protocol for short) under the Convention for the Protection and Development of the Marine Environment in the Wider Caribbean Region, also known as Cartagena Convention. There was continued implementation of other agreements including the UN CBD, Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal.
  Marine pollution is being tackled as part of a wider waste management strategy. In this regard, government entities along with civil society organisations are working to address the issue through public education and behaviour change initiatives as well as through recycling and other waste management programmes (see SDG 12). Further, a \0xECridge to reef approach is being adopted as part of the environmental management regime which seeks to reduce the erosion of watersheds (see Goal 15) and the consequent impact on coastal ecosystems.
The Way Forward
Despite the advances and achievements made, there is need to continually update and enforce legislation, and also to implement appropriate plans and policies to effect change and build resiliency. Priority will be given to addressing the effects of climate change, tackling IUU fishing and reducing land-based sources of pollution, along with improving the supporting data and information to guide the decision making processes. The Blue Economy will also be explored, particularly the potential to contribute significantly to the sustainable development aspirations of the country. Further, partnerships with stakeholders at all levels of society as well as with regional and international partners will be pursued to sustain and expand these resilience building efforts.
Goal 15 n Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss 
Jamaica is characterised by forests as well as rivers and streams which support diverse flora and fauna. These land-based resources are fundamental to the functioning of the economy and to healthy social/human systems. Threats posed to these resources have evolved over the years, prompting past and ongoing efforts to increase the extent to which the resources are more sustainably managed and used. Many of these efforts are yielding positive results but many challenges and gaps remain which the implementation of Vision 2030 Jamaica and the SDGs should help to stem. 
Progress and Achievements 
A Land Use/Cover Change Assessment (LUCA)40 of the island shows that about 40.0 per cent41 of the island (excluding cays) can be classified as forests. While there was a net increase in forest cover overall (0.4 per cent per annum), primary (Closed Broadleaf) forests were declining (0.2 per cent per annum). This analysis forms part of the data and information guiding policy, planning and management interventions. Notable achievements in this regard include the promulgation of the Forest Policy for Jamaica, 2017; the National Forest Management and Conservation Plan, 2016n2026; and the preliminary work undertaken on a new Act to update the Forest Act, 1996. Complementary initiatives relating to the governance of terrestrial resources were also advanced and included:
\0xEF Amendments to schedules of the Wildlife Protection Act to improve protection of biodiversity
\0xEF National Strategy and Action Plan on Biological Diversity in Jamaica, 2016 to 2021
\0xEF Protected Areas System Master Plan: Jamaica 2013n2017
\0xEF Forest Management Plans (FMPs) for: the Windsor Castle Forest Estate; the four estates in Forest Management Unit No. 5 and 6; and Stephney Johnis Vale Forest Reserve
\0xEF Management plan for the Mason River Protected Area, Jamaicais only inland wetland designated as a Ramsar site.

40. The LUCA, completed in 2015, compared forest cover of 1998 and 2013. 
41. Approximately 440 000 ha.
  Interventions to sustain and manage forestry resources involved reforestation efforts using timber and fruit trees, in addition to the production and distribution of tree seedlings to private planters and the general populace42. Tissue culture has also been employed to assist in conservation efforts and also to preserve plant genetics43 (see Goal 2). With respect to sustainable use of forest resources, particularly timber trees, a Sawmill Licensing Registration Programme is being implemented to regulate persons involved in the production, trade or storage of local lumber. Recognising fires as one of the greatest threats not just to forests, but also to biodiversity, a Forest Fire Management Programme is continually being rolled out to sensitize forest users and beneficiaries about forest fires and also train users in fire prevention and control. The implementation of the programme is supported by a Forest Fire Management Training Manual. Farmers are among those targetted because of the role that \0xEBslash and burni agricultural practice plays in land degradation and biodiversity loss. 
  Action geared towards biodiversity conservation focused on, inter alia, the Jamaican Iguana (Cyclura collei) which is an endemic species classified as \0xECcritically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The Jamaican Iguana Head Start Programme, a consortium of state and non-state entities, continues to facilitate the ex-situ rearing and subsequent release of iguanas into the wild and also monitoring of the species. There are also ongoing activities to reduce predators, particularly around nesting sites. Other areas of focus included the effect of invasive alien species (IAS) on biodiversity; the launch of the Jamaica Invasive Species Database will assist in this regard. 
  The inscription of the Blue and John Crow Mountains as a United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) World Heritage Site in 2015 was a milestone achievement in the protection and conservation of natural resources. With this designation, the site is recognised as having outstanding universal value with its unique mix of biodiversity and cultural heritage. See Box 8 for more information.
  Progress in the protection, restoration and sustainable use and management of terrestrial-based resources was made possible through the partnerships established and sustained with local entities, private sector interests, and the international community, to name a few. Community-level organisations such as Local Forest Management Committees (LFMCs) are particularly important as they interface directly with land-based resources, and can determine the success of interventions. Efforts are underway to retool farmers using sustainable approaches that not only reduce destructive practices but also improve their yield and resilience to climate

41. The Forestry Department was responsible for reforestation of over 300 ha of lands since 2015, and the production and distribution of over 400 000 tree seedlings.
42. The Scientific Research Council (SRC) hosts one of the largest gene banks in the Caribbean.
Box 8: UNESCO World Heritage Site n The Blue and John Crow Mountains
THE BLUE AND JOHN CROW MOUNTAINS 
UNESCO WORLD HERITAGE SITE
The Blue and John Crow Mountains were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2015. Spanning over 26 000 hectares, the site hosts many of Jamaicais endemic flora and fauna. The Mountains are classified among the 78 most irreplaceable protected areas for the conservation of the worldis amphibian, bird and mammal species; is an Endemic Bird Area; and has two of Jamaicais five Alliance for Zero Extinction sites, among others. The site met three of the ten criteria for the inscription, two cultural (iii and vi) and one natural (x). 
More information on the site can be accessed via a story map titled \0xECA Strong Place, A Strong People (see this link:
(http://goj.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Cascade/index.htmlThappid=6c25e83c9bbc40e2947 4c9020825b3cf).
The successful designation was due to strong partnership between Government of Jamaica and an environmental NGO, the Jamaica Conservation and Development Trust (JCDT). Prior to this international designation (in 2014), the Blue and John Crow Mountains Cultural Heritage Site was declared as a protected national heritage under Jamaican law.

shocks. Communities have also received training through the Watershed Areas Management Mechanism (WAMM) which engages citizens in sustainably managing watersheds. There were also partnerships established through projects and programmes which facilitated some of the achievements made. Among them is the GOJ/GEF/UNDP National Protected Areas Systems (NPAS) project which facilitated the establishment of the National Conservation Trust Fund of Jamaica (NCTFJ) and provided grants for community-level management of protected areas, among others.
  Jamaica continued to pursue action towards fulfilling relevant obligations under international multilateral agreements to which it is a Party or signatory. A summary of selected activities or achievements is noted in the Chart below. However, one achievement being highlighted relates to the Voluntary National Contribution (VNC) submitted under the UN Forum on Forests for which the country was a forerunner among SIDS. The VNC is aligned with national policies and plans, and involved reforestation of denuded lands, financing for alternative forest livelihood opportunities, increasing the protection of mangrove forests, and continued strengthening of legislation governing forestry.

Figure 26: Jamaican participation in United Nations Environmental protection programmes, conventions and fora
  Also of international importance was the designation of the Dolphin Head Forest Reserve in the parish of Hanover as a part of the Queenis Commonwealth Canopy (QCC) Project. Launched by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in 2016, the project is intended to highlight good examples of forest management and also facilitate knowledge sharing across the Commonwealth to improve conservation of forests and biodiversity. The Reserve is a predominantly closed broad leaf forest and has species of endemic flora and fauna.
The Way Forward
The government remains committed to employing the most suitable and effective measures to protect, restore and sustainably manage and use land-based natural resources. Greater focus is therefore being placed on decoupling the growing demand for these resources and their health and vitality. Action in this regard includes, inter alia, tackling the effects of climate change, stemming the proliferation of IAS, protecting endangered and endemic species and encouraging sustainable use of resources. Implementing the relevant policies and plans as well as enforcing legislation will help to build the resilience of these ecosystems to all forms of threats; however, the existing financial and technical capacities must be enhanced and expanded through partnerships for this to be realised.
Goal 16 n Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice to all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels
Security and safety are major development concerns for the Jamaican society. It has been increasingly recognized as a cross-cutting issue that has significant implications for state expenditure on areas such as health and the costs borne by both the private sector and citizens to operate businesses and ensure personal safety. As a result, the present trends in the incidence of crime and violence, as well as the resulting levels of insecurity and fear of crime, have been identified as major contributors to the low levels of economic growth and threats to the achievement of inclusive development goals. In this regard, SDG 16 is a major national priority for the government.
  The GOJ has responded to the evolving and growing nature of crime and violence through transformative changes in the approaches to how national security is defined and how prevailing challenges have been addressed. Policy and programme focus have been strengthened and expanded to address the cultural, social and economic factors that have been associated with crime. Efforts have also been made in strengthening the response capabilities of the state to criminal threats within a context of increased accountability and utilization of a rights-based approach to the protection of civil liberties. To tackle the issue of crime, the GOJ has been implementing programmes and initiatives, which target vulnerable and at risk individuals including young offenders and unattached youth. These initiatives are created with a view to build the resilience of individuals and communities to better respond to violence.
  Progress has been made under the Jamaican Justice System Reform Agenda (2012npresent), including improvements in infrastructure, human and technological resources and processes, case flow and data management, and the integration of restorative justice principles. Public sector reform also was advanced through the preparation of the Public Financial Management Reform Action Pan, and local government reform. At the forefront of the local government reform was the preparation of strategic legislation to define the responsibilities, powers and financing of local authorities, and enabling local authorities and local communities and stakeholders to collaborate in creating development in local communities.
  A number of social intervention programmes provided critical services to at-risk populations in volatile and vulnerable communities. The main social intervention programmes were: the Citizenis Security and Justice Programme; the Poverty Reduction Programme; the Integrated Community Development Project; and the
Community Empowerment and Transformation Project. Services provided included risk assessment of community residents, skills and educational training, capacity building of residents and community governance structures, mediation and conflict

resolution services, provision of pyscho-social support, and income generation intiatives.
  Over the period under review, strides were made in increasing transparency and accountability in governance. These efforts were bolstered at the local level with the entrenchment for local government in the Constitution. These accountability efforts by the government are closely monitored by NGOs such as the National Integrity Action.
  Several interventions have been pursued by the government in response to the targets of SDG 16. A summary of the main achievements is presented.

Box 9: Case Study n National Integrity Action
National Integrity Action (NIA) is Jamaicais integrity building, anti-corruption organization. The establishment of NIA grew out of the necessity to raise levels of national integrity and to combat corruption more effectively in Jamaica.  In 2011, the NIA became an official not-for-profit organisation with the objective of combatting corruption in Jamaica on a nonpartisan basis. The work of the NIA addresses SDGs 16.3 and 16.5. The mission of the NIA is to \0xECcombat corruption and build integrity in Jamaica through the persistent promotion of transparency, accountability in the conduct of government, businesses and the wider society. To achieve its mission, NIA focuses on the following priority areas: building public awareness of the prevalence of corrupt activities in society; strengthening anti-corruption institutions; and strengthening the democratic process. The NIA is credited with the following key achievements: by early 2013 one-third of the Jamaican population was aware of NIAis existence (Global Corruption Barometer, 2013); bribery victimization rates had significantly declined (LAPOP, 2010n2014); and 77.0 per cent of the population indicated willingness to join an anti-corruption organization, more than 20.0 per cent above global average (GCB, 2013). In 2015, NIA achieved the goal of becoming the Jamaica Chapter of Transparency International. The NIA is one of the NGOs which serve on the National 2030 Agenda Oversight Committee.
Goal 17 n Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development
Financing and Resource Mobilization
It is well recognised globally that financing the implementation of the SDGs is a complex task and would require coordination among the public and private sectors, international development partners and civil society. Coupled with coordination, is the need for meaningful commitment of all stakeholders to advancing the priorities of sustainable development. The Addis Ababa Action Agenda for Financing Development establishes a strong foundation to support the implementation of Agenda 2030. The Action Agenda is an integral part of the sustainable development framework, as it recognises the importance of financing flows being aligned with the economic, social and environmental priorities of states. 
  For Jamaica, implementation of the SDGs is primarily resourced by the Government with significant support from the IDPs, through loans, grants and technical assistance. The private sector and CSOs are also valuable partners. In addition, there is a push to increase the number of Public-Private-Partnerships to secure large-scale investments in critical sectors such as Agriculture, Health and Information Communications Technology. For the 2017n2018 Fiscal Year, 66.4 per cent of the national budget was funded from domestic resources, including taxes and other revenue streams. The remaining 33.6 per cent was provided through external funding in the form of loans and grants. 
  While Jamaica remains cognisant of the importance of mobilising domestic resources for implementation of the SDGs, international development partnerships are critical components in the country achieving its development priorities by 2030. An examination of IDPs support for the 17 SDGs revealed that of the approximately US$2.0 billion in loans and grants received by Jamaica, the largest support (41.0 per cent) is to SDG 9 n Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure (see Annex on IDP Financing Aligned to the SDGs in Jamaica).
  Securing adequate financial resources to implement national priories and achieve the SDGs remain challenging, particularly, given Jamaicais classification as an UMIC. This status has impacted the eligibility of the country to access much needed grants and concessionary loans. Additionally, although significant strides are being made in data collection and management, the lack of timely, adequate and appropriate data impedes evidence-based decision-making and effective targeting of interventions. In this regard, the development of financing and mobilisation strategies are needed to identify and quantify the funding gap for implementing national priorities to achieve Vision 2030 Jamaica and the SDGs.
  The Roadmap for SDG Implementation in Jamaica (2017) discusses some ideas to explore new sources of domestic, international and private financing. Some of

these include improving capacity for tax audits to address transfer pricing; exploring options for \0xEBgreen feesi, debt-for nature swaps and diaspora bonds; facilitating social impact investment; and establishing a philanthropy platform. 
Taxation
The Government of Jamaica has committed to meeting international standards for transparency in investment and tax matters, in light of the vast opportunities which may be realised within a proper legal framework. These mechanisms have created favourable conditions for the development of economic cooperation between Jamaica and its bilateral partners. Since June 2016, Jamaica has been a signatory to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, which enables the exchange of tax information with some 117 tax jurisdictions around the world.
  The text of Jamaicais Model Double Taxation Agreement (DTA) in January 2018 is to ensure conformity with international models, particularly the UN Model Double Taxation Convention and the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital. Furthermore, in January 2018, Jamaica signed the OECD Multilateral
Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and
Profit ShiThing (BEPS)/Multilateral Instrument (MLI). This mechanism will guard against tax evasion by further closing the gaps in international tax rules.
  Jamaicais commitment to mobilising means of implementation for the 2030 Agenda is reflected in the adoption of Growth Initiative 4: Pursue bureaucratic reform to improve the business environment. The Government recognises that the implementation of the SDGs requires substantial domestic financial resources. A key retardant of Jamaicais growth has been poor tax compliance which limits possible revenue from taxes. As a result, the Government of Jamaica will continue to reform its critical economic structures in an effort to foster job creation, to strengthen economic growth and ensure a prosperous future for its citizens. There is a need to upgrade information technology systems to improve electronic filing and processing of taxes, therefore simplifying the tax payment and compliance process.
Multi-stakeholder Partnerships
Several key national priorities are operationalised and implemented under the leadership of the Government in collaboration with bilateral, regional and multilateral development partners. Partnerships have also been forged with the private sector, civil society and the Jamaican Diaspora. 
  The achievement of Vision 2030 Jamaica and the attainment of the SDGs calls for genuine and durable partnerships to undertake new and innovative approaches to capitalize on national and global opportunities and address challenges. Recognising that domestic public funds and international public finance alone will not be sufficient to achieve the SDGs, the Government of Jamaica in collaboration with the Government of Canada established the Group of Friends for SDGs Financing. The aim of the initiative is to provide a platform for Member States of the UN, the private sector and other stakeholders to discuss and promote solution-oriented ideas that will unlock the funds needed for the implementation of the SDGs. It is expected that these partnerships will have long-term development impact and outcomes that encourage the kinds of investments needed to attain the SDGs.
The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) partnered with the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade (Jamaica), the Planning Institute of Jamaica and the Sir Arthur Lewis Institute for Social and Economic Studies
(SALISES) to host a regional conference under the theme \0xECCaribbean Development n The 2030 Agenda in Perspective on June 28n30, 2017. Over a three-day period, participants including Ministers of Government, high level technical experts, academia, private sector, civil society and youths from the region came together in a bid to advance and accelerate regional action on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The conference enabled participants to define the common ground among countries with regard to priority issues, creating knowledge synergies, fostering partnerships for solutions and targeting financial resources and support for scaling-up results, acknowledging the working agreement reached between Caribbean governments and UN partners on the UN Multi-Country Sustainable Development Framework (MSDF). One of the main recommendations Framework from the Caribbean Action 2030 Conference presented in the Partnership Framework for regional implementation of the SDGs was the development of an online platform. This online platform is a long-term commitment to regional partnerships and efforts that will enable the academic community, civil society and policy makers to engage in on-going dialogue on the basis of evidence-based research, open data and exchange of good policy practice. It designed to support implementation efforts on the SDGs and the UNMSDF in the region. It will provide opportunities for synergies in the areas of engagement, policy action, solutions and strategies.
The online platform will boast the following features for stakeholders:
Government
\0xEF Presentation of general information on the SDGs
\0xEF Present an update on progress on the SDGs by Caribbean countries
\0xEF A repository to share documents
\0xEF Government officials from the Caribbean region that are signatories of the United Nations Multi-country Sustainable Development Framework (UN MSDF) have access to a private area of the platform
Academia
\0xEF Share relevant articles on the SDGs
\0xEF Students and researchers can access the platform for reliable information on SDG
Public
\0xEF Access relevant information and repository on the SDGs
\0xEF Comment and pose questions 
Trade and Investment 
Trade is an important component of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and is an engine for development for all countries, in particular developing countries such as Jamaica. In order for Jamaica to attain SDGs 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 14, our ability to engage in meaningful and economically viable trading relations has become even more important given the direct link between these goals and trade.
  Jamaica, as a member of the WTO, trades with other members of that Organisation under its most favoured nation preferences for goods. Jamaica is also governed by the General Agreement for Trade in Services (GATS) for services trade. At the regional level, Jamaica trades with the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) under the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas Establishing the Caribbean Single Market and Economy (CSME) and is Party to several trade agreements as a member of CARICOM which are meant to promote trade between and among the signatory parties. Jamaica also benefits from preferential trade through Generalised Systems of Preferences (GSP) schemes with a number of its bilateral partners, namely the USA, Canada and the EU. With respect to the EU, there is presently an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) which sets out, through trade development, sustainable growth and poverty reduction, to help CARIFORUM countries integrate into the world economy and share in the opportunities offered by globalization. The EPA is intended to go beyond conventional free trade agreements n focusing on development, taking account of socioeconomic circumstances and including cooperation and assistance to help implement the terms. In its provisional application, it allows for duty-free access of goods and services into the EU market
  Jamaica has negotiated a number of bilateral investment agreements with developed and developing countries to increase foreign direct investment. Notwithstanding, as a SIDS, Jamaica has had limited benefits from its trading relations. Combined, the trade in both goods and services has a persistent deficit on Jamaicais current account. For most of the last 50 years, imports have generally increased, while exports of goods have remained relatively stable. However, both imports and exports have been trending downwards in recent years with the exception of services exports which have seen marginal increases since 2011. 
  Among the challenges identified for the lack of reciprocal benefits to Jamaica are: high energy cost as input to manufacturing; limited capacity; heavy reliance on imported capital goods; diseconomies of scale (sectors consist of mostly small producers in comparison to larger economies that produce similar products and services); fluctuation in the exchange rate; lack of adequate trade financing especially for MSMEs; limited technology transfer; and vulnerability to the effects of climate change (extreme weather events such as droughts and hurricanes). 
  Cognisant of the challenges in trade and investment faced by the country, Jamaica has sought to diversify its base of export products and services. Focus has been placed on new high-value industries, such as business processing and the creation of a logistics hub, which would take advantage of the countryis location in the centre of the main shipping routes. Greater reliance is also being placed on non-traditional exports such as health and wellness products and services, which need to be further supported by quality control and accreditation measures if Jamaica is to improve market share in this billion dollar industry; higher value-added processed foods; and entertainment and fashion, which are products of the copyright-based cultural and creative industries. With respect to Energy, Jamaicais future is inextricably linked to finding cost-effective, environmentally sustainable energy solutions. In this regard, Jamaica will continue to create an environment that will facilitate the development and connection of renewable systems to the energy grid.
  The cultural and creative industries contribute approximately 4.8 per cent to GDP and 3.0 per cent of all employment. In this context, capitalizing on Jamaicais strong national brand \0xECBrand Jamaica, maximizing Jamaicais intellectual property (IP) and strengthening the intellectual property rights protection regime have become crosscutting export strategies. However, limited disaggregated data on the export performance of the creative industries continue to be a challenge.
Capacity Building and Appropriate Technology Transfer 
Jamaica intends to exceed the targets in ICT development, as outlined in Vision 2030 as well as those of Agenda 2030 by using disruptive innovation, underpinned by sound science. Target 9c of the SDGs calls, for among other things, a significant increase in access to the internet technology as well as intensified efforts to provide universal and affordable access to Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). 
  In the 2017, Measuring the Information Society Report published by the International Telecommunication Union, the ICT Development Index (IDI) for Jamaica increased to 4.84 in 2017 from 4.63 in 2016. However the countryis rank has fallen 2 places from 96 to 98 out of 176 economies. In the area of access to ICTs, Jamaicais rank and index have increased from 2016, with an access sub-index of 5.29 and position of 93. With an IDI use sub-index of 3.94, fixed (wired) broadband services have subscriptions of 10.12 per 100 inhabitants, while active mobile broadband subscriptions are indicated at 56.22 per 100 inhabitants. While mobile cellular subscriptions are greater than a 1:1 ratio (115.6 per 100 inhabitants), other indices such as households with computer and internet access reflect lower percentages. 
  Jamaica recorded 1.5 million internet users in 2017, which represents 56.0 per cent of the population, up from the 1.1 million users recorded in 2011. The Internet Accessibility Index notes that Jamaica has 1.6 million mobile internet users and is ranked 12th out of 58 countries surveyed in 2017. The rapid expansion of internet users over the last decade reflects Jamaicais commitment to open access and the acceptance of technology development. 
  Overall, usage has been increasing, with variations by age, gender and geographic location. Active mobile-broadband subscriptions have been reported at 88.9 per cent, showing higher uptake than averages for the Americas and the World. 
  In April 2018, the Scientific Research Council (SRC) established and launched Jamaicais first Science & Technology Business Incubator. This Innovation Lab and
Science Resource Centre is the first of its kind in the region and will support entrepreneurs working on climate change research and technologies. 
  Jamaica has also sought to build capacity by establishing science and technology parks as important economic adaptations towards sustainable economic growth. It is intended that these science and technology parks will act as a nexus between business and science; promote innovation-based economic growth and play a significant role in knowledge and technology transfer into market; promote and contribute to local and regional economic development; facilitate the emergence of new technology-based companies; bring together local and international capacities from universities, research and development (R&D) institutions, start-ups, and corporations etc. to generate new high value-added products for global consumption.
  Additionally, there have been ongoing initiatives and partnerships to facilitate access to the internet through Community Access Points (CAPs).  As at October 2017, 260 CAPs have been established through the Universal Service Fund, in partnership with NGOs, CBOs and other organizations.  This ongoing initiative is a key component of the \0xECTechnology-enabled Society highlighted in the MTF.  CAPS are also being retrofitted with solar panels to support the energy resources needed for operation, which is a useful linkage with Goal 7.  

Figure 28: Number of Community Access Points across Jamaica
Data, Monitoring and Statistics
The Statistical Institute of Jamaica (STATIN), the national statistics office, is charged, by virtue of the Statistics Act to collect, compile, analyse and publish statistical information on the social, economic and the general conditions and activities of the Jamaican people. STATIN also has responsibility to \0xECpromote and develop integrated social and economic statistics pertaining to Jamaica and to co-ordinate programmes for the integration of such statistics. Though charged with this responsibility, the legal and operational framework to support this activity is not clearly defined in the Statistics Act. In addition the Statistics Act covers only the work of STATIN and not the other producers of official statistics. 
  In Jamaica, official statistics is produced in a decentralized system by a number of Government MDAs. Within these MDAs, the production of statistics is governed by sector specific policy direction and legislation pertaining to that particular entity. These policies and legislation however, oThen do not specifically outline the framework for the production of official statistics, and do not mandate adherence to the common statistical standards or require coordination and collaboration. This has resulted in the absence of a coordinated framework in which there is a lack of harmonised concepts, definitions, methodologies, standards, classifications and geographic demarcations. 
  This lack of coordination among the producers of official statistics in Jamaica limits the ability of Jamaicais National Statistics System (NSS) to respond to the data requirements of policy makers, businesses, and the public. The data requirements of Vision 2030 Jamaica, regional CARICOM work programmes aimed at measuring the impact of the CSME, International Trade Agreements and the SDGs all drive the need for the production and dissemination of relevant statistics in a coordinated manner. 
  Jamaica has played a critical role in the Inter-Agency Expert Group on SDGs Indicators (IAEG-SDGs) as a representative for the Caribbean over the period 2015n 2017. Through the leadership of STATIN, Jamaica continues to advocate for enhanced support for the data monitoring systems in the region.
  There is a growing demand for data on Jamaica and for these data to be provided in a timely manner and in a more accessible way to users. Monitoring of the SDGs will add significantly to this growing demand as we seek to assess the countryis progress towards these goals. This has placed further stress on the limited resources of STATIN and the other data producers in the public sector. In order to effectively respond to these data needs, greater investment in production of statistics and in building statistical capacity across the NSS is required.
  In addition to the need for increased data collection through traditional means such as surveys, Jamaicais NSS will have to increase the use of administrative data and other non-traditional data sources in order to effectively respond. The use of administrative data from MDAs will therefore become more important. Inter-agency access to data from administrative and official sources is however inconsistent and the quality of information is not guaranteed as the data are not always compiled for statistical purposes. The process of information sharing between MDAs is also not legally mandated and for the most part takes place at the discretion of the relevant institutions. Data are not always available for use by other agencies for statistical purposes as they are either unaware of its existence or are simply unable to access it. 
  In an effort to address these and other weaknesses in the system a number of strategies are being developed by STATIN. These include: 
\0xEF Amendments to the Statistics Act to provide a mechanism for the coordination of the National Statistics System (NSS) through the establishment of the Statistics Commission which will provide governance of the NSS
\0xEF Preparation of a National Strategy for the Development of Statistics (NSDS) for Jamaica
\0xEF Restructuring of STATIN to provide technical and administrative support to the Commission and the wider NSS as well as improving its capability to satisfy the increasing demand for data.
  With technical assistance from the Partnership in Statistics for Development in the 21st Century (PARIS21) is currently in the process of preparing a NSDS for Jamaica to guide the development of the NSS. This will provide the country with a vision for the development of statistics consistent with Vision 2030 Jamaica. It will contain a detailed action plan for the production and dissemination of statistics over a period of 5 to 10 years, including capacity development needs, and required institutional and infrastructure improvements. 
  An important step in the development of the NSDS was the assessment of Jamaicais NSS in 2017. The assessment found:

Figure 29: Main Findings from Statistical Capacity Assessment
  Notwithstanding the initiatives being undertaken by Jamaica in its efforts to attain the SDGs, there remain areas of serious concern. These challenges inclusive of the digital divide and limited access to new and innovative technologies, serve to undermine efforts to build a technology enabled society. The importance, therefore, of appropriate technology transfer and partnerships cannot be overstated.
  While there is a strong partnership at the government-donor countries and national multi-sectoral levels, the following are further highlighted for enhancing partnerships and strengthening the means of implementation of the SDGs:-
\0xEF development of the supporting mechanisms for enhancing data collection on the
SDGs
\0xEF strengthening of institutional coordination and partnerships
\0xEF national engagement at all stages of the policy process to promote the importance of the SDGs for national development.

Institutional Mechanism
he national coordination mechanism for the 2030 Agenda is multi-tiered and comprises the: National 2030 Agenda Oversight Committee (NAOC); Thematic
Working Groups of Vision 2030 Jamaica and other sector specific committees; and the 2030 Agenda SDGs Core Group (Core Group). A SDGs Secretariat has been established in the Planning Institute of Jamaica (PIOJ), with responsibility for supporting all aspects of the work of the NAOC and its sub-committees n a) Communications; b) Data, Monitoring and Reporting; and c) Resource Mobilisation and Financing. 
  The NAOC, which reports to Cabinet, was established in 2017 a technical body comprising high-level representatives from government, civil society groups, private sector, academia, trade unions, political directorate and youth. The mandate of the Committee is to provide policy and strategic level advice for the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the SDGs. The work of this Committee is linked to the implementation and monitoring of the post-2015 development agenda. The NAOC is chaired by the Director General of the PIOJ and meet on a quarterly basis or as deemed necessary. Through the PIOJ, updates are provided to Cabinet at agreed intervals.
  Jamaica has adopted a tripartite mechanism comprising three key national focal points (Core Group): the PIOJ, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade (MFAFT), and the Statistical Institute of Jamaica (STATIN). The SDGs Core Group supports the NAOC to:
\0xEF provide policy and technical advice to Cabinet, Parliament, Ministries, Department and Agencies
\0xEF promote institutional coordination at the national and sub-national levels for policy coherence
\0xEF facilitate inclusive and multi-stakeholder participation
\0xEF coordinate the monitoring, reporting and accountability framework for the SDGs
\0xEF manage public education campaign/awareness and advocacy for the SDGs.
  The Core Group supports and guides the work of the SDGs Secretariat based in the PIOJ. Within the broader context of the post-2015 development agenda, the Core Group, through its engagement with all the development partners, facilitates the integration of the priorities of the following development frameworks into the national development agenda:
\0xEF the SAMOA Pathway for Small Island Developing States (SIDS)
\0xEF the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, 2015n2030 \0xEF	the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development, and 
\0xEF the Paris Agreement.
  The Thematic Working Groups (TWGs) of Vision 2030 Jamaica and other sector committees form a critical arm of the institutional structure. TWGs are multisectoral and multi-stakeholder bodies that collectively serve as the key institutional arrangement for monitoring and evaluation of Vision 2030 Jamaica and the 2030 Agenda. TWGs play a key role in the development of each MTF and have been critical partners in developing policies, strategies and frameworks to address development gaps. The roles and responsibilities of the TWGs are to:
\0xEF provide input into new and existing sectoral policies and strategies relating to thematic areas
\0xEF review progress of implementation of MTF and provide feedback on performance relative to sectoral targets, and act as a forum for strategic assessment and analysis of key results areas of the Plan
\0xEF facilitate effective partnerships towards the implementation of MTF and achievement of Vision 2030 Jamaica goals and outcomes.
  The TWGs are chaired by Permanent Secretaries or senior government officials. The TWGs have been actively engaged in discussion and implementation plans for the SDGs in their respective thematic areas. The current TWGs are:
\0xEF Education and Training
\0xEF Effective Social Protection
\0xEF Energy and Minerals Development
\0xEF Environment and Planning
\0xEF Governance
\0xEF Hazard Risk Reduction and Climate Change
\0xEF Health
\0xEF Infrastructure and Construction
\0xEF Justice
\0xEF National Security
\0xEF Population
\0xEF Tourism
  At the level of Parliament, matters relating to the SDGs will be considered by the Internal and External Affairs Committee.

INSTITUTIONAL MECHANISM

Systemic and Structural Issues
    espite recording growth in GDP levels over the last 4 years, the Jamaican economy at the end of 2016 was still below its 2007 GDP level (pre-crisis period). This is against the background of an improvement in Jamaicais macroeconomic and business environments. However, the economyis performance continued to be negatively impacted by structural issues, which have tempered the pace of growth within the economy.

Some of the factors that have led to lower than expected growth in the Jamaican economy over the last 10 years, include:
Weather-related shocks:
\0xEF Jamaica is exposed to different climate-related hazards, such as storms and hurricanes (given our location in the Atlantic Hurricane belt), and other extreme events such as drought and flooding from intense rainfall, among others. This susceptibility is even more pronounced in recent years because of climate change, the impact of which is most evident in the Agriculture industry, which continues to be plagued by weather related shocks.
\0xEF To address these issues, the GOJ has continued to invest in climate change adaptation and mitigation projects, in areas such as irrigation. These types of projects, along with other measures, are expected to build resilience within the built and natural environment.
Inefficient Plants & Equipment:
\0xEF The relatively aged plants and equipment that are operational within the Mining & Quarrying; Electricity & Water Supply; and Manufacture industries, have also contributed to the relatively lower than expected economic growth, as these industries continue to be plagued by plant downtime and inefficiency, which have negatively impacted output.
\0xEF The GOJ has addressed this by increasing the tax depreciation rate and initial capital allowances, as well as implementing sound fiscal and monetary policies, which have led to a downward trend in interest rates. This should make it more economical to invest in the upgrade of production plants and equipment. 
Crime:
\0xEF Crime affects the social stability, as well as discourages both domestic and international investments. At the firm level, it introduces uncertainty and inefficiencies in the production process, as it imposes a cost on firms, as well as limits the production time. The Inter-American Development Bank, in a 2014 study, estimated that crime-related costs for Jamaica amounted to 3.99 per cent of GDP.37
\0xEF The Government is addressing the problem of crime using different methods of intervention at the national security level and through social protection. There was an increase in the resources allocated to social protection for preventative measures, to programmes such as those addressing parenting, restorative justice and targetting unattached youth. Additionally, increased resources have been allocated to national security to equip the security forces with more tools in the fight against crime.
Human Capital Development:
\0xEF The level and quality of human capital development have adversely impacted growth and productivity, through: (a) inadequate \0xECskilling of the labour force; (b) skills mismatch, and (c) the cross-border net out flow of skilled labour. 
\0xEF Efforts are ongoing to improve the quality of the labour force through the Public and Private Sector Partnership (PPP) in Education which is tasked with establishing an institutional framework and strategies that will intensify the alignment of the education and training sector with labour market needs and outcomes. 
Weak Linkages within the Economy:
\0xEF The relatively weak linkages between industries continue to hinder the pace of growth within the economy, as growth in one area, for example, the tourism sector, has not had the desired level of spillover to other industries such as Agriculture and Manufacture. To address this issue, a steering committee was established to strengthen the linkages between the Tourism sector and the Agriculture and Manufacture industries. This is critical, as Jamaica continues to perform exceptionally well in attracting tourist (approximately 4.3 million tourists visited Jamaica in 2017). Therefore, the extent to which other industries can benefit from growth in one area of the economy will lead to a stronger growth rate of the economy.
Access to Finance:
\0xEF There has been improvements in the financial system as more and more firms are able to access financing at lower interest rates. This, however, is not the case for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME). In response, an Access to Finance Project has been developed to implement measures to increase access to finance, especially, for MSMEs.
Cost of Energy:
\0xEF The cost of energy has been a major factor that has constrained development within the economy, especially within energy intensive industries like Mining & Quarrying and Manufacturing. This partly reflects an inefficient system (generation plant, transmission and distribution) and the fuel source. The GOJ has created the policy environment and regulations to facilitate greater diversification in the source of energy utilized (new wind farms, solar farms and use of LNG) and the construction of more efficient plants in the Electricity &
Water Supply, Manufacturing, and Bauxite & Mining Industries
High Debt to GDP ratio:
\0xEF Despite the improvement in Jamaicais debt-to-GDP ratio to 103.3 per cent as at December 2017 from 145.1 per cent in March 2013, the country remains highly indebted. This indebtedness has constrained the level of investment in growth enhancing areas, such as education and infrastructure. To address this problem, the GOJ has amended the Financial Administration & Audit and Public Bodies Management & Accountability Acts in 2014 to include enhanced fiscal rules. The objective of the amendments was, among other things, to entrench in law the GOJ commitment to reduce the Debt-to-GDP ratio to 60.0 per cent or less by the end of Fiscal Year 2025/26. 
Business Environment:
\0xEF The 2018 World Bank Doing Business Report (DBR), ranks Jamaica 70th out of 190 countries. Areas in which Jamaica is ranked relatively low include Trading across Borders and Registering Property, where the country is ranked 130 and 128, respectively. Given the size of the Jamaican economy, trade is very important to achieve sustainably higher level of economic growth. Through the coordination and facilitation role of the National Competitiveness Council (NCC), the GOJ has been engaging stakeholders since 2010 to understand the issues faced in doing business, and has implemented reform programmes to address these issues. The NCC has made progress, especially in the areas of starting a business and getting credit, where Jamaica is ranked 5th and 20th, respectively. 
  While Jamaica has seen many achievements, several challenges remain. These challenges are primarily triggered by the particular vulnerabilities and external economic shocks that small island developing states face. These vulnerabilities include the impact of natural disasters and the negative effects of climate change, external economic shocks and high levels of indebtedness which have constrained our efforts towards sustainable development.
  The main challenge for Jamaica as articulated by the MAPS Mission is implementing policies that will trigger fast and sustained progress towards the goals in a context of limited fiscal space. The ambition of Vision 2030 Jamaica and the 2030 Agenda require the prioritization of catalytic actions that can drive progress across multiple goals and targets simultaneously. The main challenges for the full implementation of the SDGs are primarily in the following areas: (1) Financing; (2) Policy Coherence (3) Effective Development Coordination across sectors; and (4) Data for Monitoring and Accountability.
  Arising from the SDGs Roadmap for implementation, proposals were made to address financing the SDGs in Jamaica from both the public and the private sectors.
SYSTEMIC AND STRUCTURAL ISSUES
Due to the strong alignment of the SDGs and Vision 2030 Jamaica, implementation of priority activities across successive MTFs will be geared towards the achievement of the SDGs.
  There is need to establish mechanisms for the sustainable financing of national development priorities, including the implementation of those aligned with the SDGs to respond to the inter-sectoral linkages and partnerships, and implementation of policy bundles that are representative of the integration of social, economic and environmental development concerns. Also, there is need for developing national statistical capacity and data quality to inform national development and strengthen evidence-based decision making. Due to resource constraints some very important surveys are not being undertaken in a timely manner to meet the data demands. Other challenges include: 
\0xEF ensuring inclusiveness and representation so that no one is leTh behind
\0xEF mainstreaming SDGS into Strategic and Operational Plans of all civil society groups
\0xEF increasing public education and awareness
\0xEF the establishment of effective sub-national level/inter-sectoral mechanisms for policy implementation, monitoring and evaluation.

 Leaving No One Behind
his section of the report is based on a summary of a detailed report on Leaving No One Behind. The chapter explores the characteristics of groups that are at risk of being leTh behind in the fulfilment of the SDGs in Jamaica, and the opportunities that are being pursued or developed to ensure integration and inclusion. \0xEBLeaving no one behindi means that the benefits of development are equitably distributed and that the most vulnerable and marginalized are able to realize their potential. It means that no one is discriminated against because of their race, ethnicity, colour, identity, age, residence, sex, political affiliation, income, abilities, or other statuses.
  The Social Protection Strategy (2014) is the countryis first comprehensive and systematic approach and framework for addressing the issues of vulnerability and social protection. Under the Social Protection Strategy, vulnerable groups have less access to basic social services; have inadequate access to the labour market and decent work; are consistently recorded below the poverty lines; and live in communities that lack social amenities and are prone to violence and crime. Those groups of persons face at least one of these risks (1) poverty (2) income and food insecurity. The groups were identified during national community discussions and examination of data from national surveys. The main groups in the Jamaican society that have been identified as being at risk of being leTh behind are:
\0xEF Children living in poverty
\0xEF Unemployed Youth
\0xEF Persons with Disabilities
\0xEF Residents in the Rural Areas
\0xEF Older Persons
\0xEF Fisherfolk
\0xEF Informal Settlers
\0xEF Rural Farmers
\0xEF Pregnant and Lactating women
\0xEF Adolescents and Youth

  These groups are considered \0xEBat riski because they may have limited access to basic social services, typically possess low human capital skills including low levels of education, are highly susceptible to the negative impacts of natural disasters, and live in impoverished households and communities. Over the years, the government has implemented several social programmes in, response to the needs of these groups. Some of the initiatives have been successful and sustained, while others require additional support and reviews.
Persons living below the poverty line
SDG 1 calls for the eradication of poverty in all its forms, everywhere by 2030. Those in poverty are more likely than any other groups to be \0xECleTh behind. Poverty in Jamaica is measured using a basket of food and non-food consumption variables. However, poverty is a multifaceted and complex phenomenon characterized by a multiplicity of vulnerabilities including capability and human capital deprivations.
  Some of the key challenges of poverty in Jamaica are: \0xECthe persistence of poverty, especially in the rural areas, poor educational outcomes which lead to inadequate preparation of youth for employment; insufficient social security coverage against various risks; inadequate provisions for meeting the needs of low income households for shelter and related infrastructure; lack of provisions for increasing equity in the society for disadvantaged and vulnerable groups; insufficient institutional capacities, particularly in the public sector, to effectively deliver social protection interventions.40
Urban Poor Communities
While the Rural Areas have consistently reported larger proportions of their members in poverty, attention has to be paid to the urban poor as urban poverty can sometimes be more severe than rural poverty because of population concentration and density. Some urban areas in Jamaica have high levels of poverty, crime and violence. Characteristics of poor urban communities include:
\0xEF High levels of youth unemployment
\0xEF High levels of adult unemployment
\0xEF Precarious employment
\0xEF Limited or no opportunities for training and employment
\0xEF High levels of high school dropout
\0xEF Poor Parenting
\0xEF Low skills
\0xEF High levels of illiteracy and low levels of numeracy
\0xEF Poor drainage facilities.
Fisherfolk 
There are 23 687 registered fisherfolks in Jamaica. SDGs 13 and 14 are of particular importance to small-scale fisherfolk as their livelihoods are severely impacted by changing water levels and flooding events, while coastal marine fisheries dependent on sensitive ecosystems such as coral reefs will be impacted by rising water temperature that affects ecosystem functions. Change in ocean currents will affect zone fisheries, coral bleaching affecting reef fisheries and there will be disruptions to fish reproductive patterns and migratory routes; more frequent loss of fishing days due to bad weather, increasing loss of nets, traps and long lines, damage to boats and shore facilities, increased loss of life among fishermen, increase damage to coastal communities n houses, farmland etc. 
Rural Farmers
Rural Farmers are at risk of being leTh behind for several SDGs, including Goals 1, 5, 10 and 15. The livelihoods of farmers are threatened by extreme weather conditions, and pest and disease outbreaks, which cause crop and income losses and increase food insecurity. The Jamaican government has recognised the importance of the agricultural sector to the achievement of Vision 2030 Jamaica and the SDGs. Several policies and programmes have been implemented, including: the National Food and Nutrition Security Policy and Action Plan, the National Youth in Agriculture Policy and Implementation Plan and the Import Substitution Programme.
Children at risk of being left behind
Children account for the largest proportion of persons living below the poverty line. Child poverty levels remain high and urgent attention is needed to ensure that child vulnerability and marginalization are decreased to prevent entire generation from being leTh behind. There are instances where children who are experiencing poverty, are discriminated against, marginalized and exploited as a result of their circumstances. These categories of children face a high probability of being leTh behind. They have limited access to basic social services, and policy decision-making processes as well as, in some cases, their rights are violated. These include41:
\0xEF Children with disabilities
\0xEF Children living with and affected by HIV/AIDS
\0xEF Children in state care
\0xEF Children working and living on the streets
\0xEF Children deprived of familial care and living in state institutions
\0xEF Children who are victims of all forms of abuse
\0xEF Children living in poverty.
The Youth
The future of a nation is in the hands of its children and youth. Jamaicais youth population (15n24 years) is 18.9 per cent of the population and will form the adult population by 2030. It is imperative that the youth acquire the necessary skills and knowledge to ensure nation-building and high levels of productivity. SDGs 4 and 8 are of particular importance to this group as the nation strives to achieve sustainable and inclusive economic growth, through education and access to productive employment, and decent work for all. The unemployed youth have low human capital skills and 70.0 per cent of the unemployed have no academic certification.42 Youth are still highly represented among the victims and perpetrators of crime, though the rates are declining. 
Older Persons
Average life expectancy is 74.2 years and as a result, there is a greater lifetime exposure to chronic non-communicable diseases which have increased the burden of disease on the health care system. However, because of their decreased productivity and reduced contribution to national economies, older persons are at risk of being leTh behind in the fulfilment of the SDGs.
  In Jamaica, older persons (persons aged 60 and older), comprised 12.4 per cent of the national population, approximately 339 400 persons of which 176 200 were females. The National Policy for Senior Citizens 2018 (Green Paper) is the main framework for delivery of services to older persons including health, education, intergenerational transfers and income security. Approximately 10.0 per cent of older persons live in poverty, and there is also an added health burden as many of them suffer from chronic illnesses that are expensive to treat. Data also show that there is a feminization of old age which is even higher among the 80+ age group. Older persons, especially older women tend to be poorer and also in need of special care due to frailty. While several programmes are being implemented to address the needs of this population sub-group, further concerted actions are required. 
Persons with Disabilities
Persons with disabilities (PWDs) face many challenges and are at risk of being leTh behind in the fulfilment of the SDGs. SDG 10 calls for reduction in inequality and sustainable development for all. In 2016, some 30 625 persons with disabilities were registered with the Jamaica Council for Persons with Disabilities (JCPD). This is evidently a relatively small proportion of the population with disabilities.
  Persons with disabilities in Jamaica face numerous challenges due to a number of factors, chief of which are:
\0xEF Inaccessible education and training systems which lead to challenges in gaining meaningful employment. Those who are qualified, are discriminated against because of a lack of understanding about disabilities and the capabilities of these persons. Some who are employed do not get the opportunity, as those with abilities, for mentorship, coaching and leadership development and so they do not advance in their careers. 
\0xEF Inaccessible physical environment n several buildings are not constructed in accordance with the Building Code. To ensure accessibility, Universal Design is paramount to ensure accommodation for all persons of varying sizes, abilities and capabilities. Many Government buildings where social protection services
are to be accessed are inaccessible and so persons with disabilities are inadvertently prevented from receiving the necessary services. 
\0xEF Inaccessibility to services also includes the inability of providers to communicate with hearing-impaired individuals and so information or the ability of hearingimpaired individuals to provide statements of abuse or mistreatment to the police cannot be done in a manner that protects the individualis dignity or rights. Hearing-impaired individuals are also unable to access justice systems for similar reasons. Also needed are proper and adequate lighting and bold signage in buildings to enable persons who are hearing or visually impaired to read directions or names of places. 
\0xEF Discrimination based on misperceptions and myths about disabilities. While many persons understand that this is not the case, some still hold to these misconceptions because some disabilities cannot be easily explained e.g. Autism. Mental illness is another disability that is highly stigmatized. Some persons with disabilities are therefore unable to get jobs because of the perceived challenges. 
\0xEF Inaccessible transportation system n efforts have been made to equip buses in the Government owned Jamaica Urban Transit Corporation fleet. Despite this improvement, the PWD population remains underserved. In this regard, all buses should be made accessible to everyone. Transportation issues in rural areas remain a major concern. Therefore there are increased calls for disability-friendly transportation to increase the level of independence of PWDs with physical disabilities. 
\0xEF Public announcements, and warnings of imminent disasters are usually given through various media. Special consideration is required on how the messages can reach the hearing-impaired and persons with intellectual disabilities. A format that will enable all of society to access the information should be provided through an appreciation and application of Universal Design. 
\0xEF The cost of technology and assistive devices to PWDs n OThen technology opens the doors to assist with many of the challenges PWDs encounter and although some funding is provided to support the purchase of assistive devices, the needs are far greater than the supply. 
\0xEF Housing n Despite the provision of housing through the National Housing Trust, not many PWDs can access it since it is a contributory scheme and the majority of PWDs is unemployed. Practical solutions for the provision of housing need to be discussed and implemented. 
  The SDGs provide a solid framework for the development and provision of solutions that can be applied in working with the community for PWDs generally. Children with disabilities are usually voiceless. They face greater levels of attitudinal, environmental and institutional challenges. Areas for action recommended by stakeholders in the PWD community, specifically in the education sector include:
\0xEF the inclusion of Basic Sign Language in the curriculum of Teachersi Colleges to enable teachers to assist with early identification and referrals. 
\0xEF training in differentiated learning to address the diverse abilities and learning styles in the classroom. Every child in the classroom would benefit from this methodology and so lesson planning would be according to Individual Educational Plans (IEPs). A variety of therapists e.g. Speech or Occupational Therapists would facilitate \0xEBpull outi sessions to enable specialized consultations based on the disability and the needs presented. 
\0xEF increased and sustained public awareness on the issues relating to PWDs to reduce the levels of discrimination 
\0xEF increase in the accessibility for children with disabilities in schools through adequate construction of ramps and bathroom facilities. Reading and examination materials in an accessible format such as braille 
\0xEF increase availability of public disability assessment and diagnostic services in rural areas 
\0xEF increase the number of speech and rehabilitation specialists. 
Leaving No One Behind (LNOB): The Critical Pathway to Success
While Jamaica has a plethora of policies and programmes that seek to provide social protection for the poor and vulnerable, a critical success factor will entail their implementation to trigger fast and sustained progress towards the goals in a context of limited fiscal space. Leaving no one behind will require several structural and systemic adjustments. The critical pathway to the fulfilment of the SDGs for those most at risk involves some immediate actions based on the identification of priorities.
Some main priorities include:
\0xEF Evidence-based policy formulation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation
Timely disaggregated data on the populations that are at risk of being leTh behind are needed for effective targeting and monitoring of implementation of the SDGs. Utilisation of available data to set development targets for the most vulnerable and to implement and monitor programmes are important to achieve these targets.
\0xEF Financing the SDGs
To ensure that no one is leTh behind will necessitate an adequate provision and equitable distribution of resources. Meeting the needs of the remotest and most inaccessible persons or groups may require new sources of funding. Partnerships with all the relevant stakeholders will be crucial through coordination and collaboration among the local, regional and international partners will be critical. 
\0xEF Effective governance and the political prioritisation of marginalised groups are imperatives. Elected officials have a duty to provide essential services, such as education, health care, and social welfare programmes for all its citizens. 
\0xEF Cultural change is perhaps the most difficult to attain, but it is fundamental for buy-in and commitment to support the realisation of the SDGs for all Jamaicans, especially for the most vulnerable. A normative shiTh is needed to promote and sustain progressive attitudes and actions by all stakeholders, including policy makers working with marginalized groups. This would necessitate public education and community activism. Effective communication and advocacy are key to gaining ownership of the SDGs and garnering commitment from all.
  In working towards achieving the SDGs, it is recognized that a specific focus on reaching those who are furthest behind will facilitate key initiatives and accelerate overall progress towards the goals. At the international, regional and local levels, Jamaica continues to represent and highlight the needs of vulnerable groups who are at-risk of being leTh behind in the progress towards achieving the 2030 Agenda. There is recognition of Jamaicais advocacy on behalf of members of the society, and its partners in the regional and international communities. As one of the first countries to have included human rights in its foreign policy, and its pursuit of continued initiatives to leave no one behind, Jamaica is positioned to make an impact in this area, if the country is able to implement the necessary supporting mechanisms.
  There are many challenges to be addressed in relation to those who are at risk of being leTh behind. In addition to, and supported by advocacy, resources will need to be identified to support key efforts in leaving no one behind. These include:
\0xEF Further infusion of the \0xECleave no one behind objectives through technical, financial and human resources development in projects and programmes in all sectors
\0xEF Localization of the SDGs, including translation into formats that various sectors or groups identify with
\0xEF Increased partnerships and development of synergies across projects and sectors, including all stakeholders n government, international development partners, regional organizations and networks, academia, private sector, CBOs, NGOs, CSOs, and religious organizations.
\0xEF Increased focus on the collection of data needed to monitor the progress towards the goals, with specific attention to data related to vulnerabilities, such as the impact of disasters on vulnerable groups and those who are at risk of being leTh behind.

Next Steps
he preparation of the VNR and the development of the 4th MTF 2018n2021 were conducted concurrently. The national priorities being pursued under MTF
2018n2021 demonstrate that Jamaicais contribution to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the achievement of the SDGs are intricately aligned with the core and underlying principles. The priorities being pursued also demonstrate the countryis commitment to achieving a transformed world through active engagement in regional and international dialogue, planning and decision-making to promote sustainability, equity and inclusiveness in the relationships among and within states for the achievement of shared prosperity. Jamaica, as with SIDS in general, has have higher stakes and more easily identifiable gains in the achievement of the envisioned transformed world which serves as a pragmatic motivator for the countryis championing of the Agenda. However, within the context of working towards achieving a transformed world are negotiations on values and the preservation of national identity, autonomy and the achievement of national development goals while striving towards sustainability, equity and inclusiveness. 
  The priority programmes, projects and activities to be pursued over the medium term, 2018n2021 under each of the national goals and national outcomes of Vision 2030 Jamaica are presented accordingly.

CASE STUDY ON GOAL 7: JAMAICA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY LIMITED (JPS) nTHE UTILITYiS ROLE IN MODERNIZING JAMAICAiS ENERGY SECTOR
Overview
Jamaica Public Service Company Limited (JPS) is an integrated electric utility company and the sole distributor of electricity in Jamaica. The Company is engaged in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity. The Company owns and operates four (4) power stations, nine (9) hydroelectric plants, and one (1) wind farm. JPSi Transmission & Distribution (T&D) network includes 53 substations and over 14 000 kilometres of lines across the island. Beyond the provision of electricity, JPS is a key partner in national development. 
A New Strategic Direction
In 2013, JPS did an objective analysis of its operations and redefined its role as a partner in national development. This review resulted in the development of a new strategic plan, new vision and mission statements, designed to further the objectives of Jamaicais Vision 2030 and National Energy Policy. 
  Recognizing the changing face of the energy landscape globally, as the nationis main provider of energy, JPS embraced its role of \0xECleading the energy revolution, unleashing Jamaicais growth and prosperity, and gave a commitment to provide \0xECan energy revolution, as articulated in its new Vision and Mission, respectively. The Company established a new energy strategy, founded on the four pillars of:
\0xEF Fuel Diversification
\0xEF Smart Grid Technology
\0xEF Unique Solutions for Customers
\0xEF Nation Building, through Energy Efficiency, Customer Empowerment & Energy Education initiatives
Changes in the Operating Environment
Since the roll-out of its new strategic roadmap, JPS has experienced several milestone regulatory and legislative changes. Government policies were changed, as the growing number of players in the industry aligned around the vision for Jamaicais energy sector that would both further economic growth and promote energy security. 
  A new regulatory framework emerged, including a new operating license for JPS, a new Electricity Act, and a revised Act to guide the Office of Utilities Regulation (OUR), which has oversight for the electricity sector. These changes were an integral part of the Government of Jamaicais strategy to modernize the electricity sector, to ensure energy security and sustainability, as well as access to affordable energy by Jamaicans. 
Fuel Diversification
Fuel Diversification is an integral part of Jamaicais National Energy Policy, as the country seeks to reduce its heavy dependence on oil. 
  ATher more than a decade of seeking to bring natural gas to Jamaica, in 2014, the Government gave JPS the mandate to lead the effort, as part of the national push for fuel diversity. The use of LNG is expected to result in greater stability in the price of electricity for customers n a primary objective of JPS and the Government of Jamaica. LNG will enable the production of cleaner energy, while allowing for more seamless integration of renewables.

In its 2014n2019 Tariff Review Determination, the OUR approved a specific Bogue Plant Reconfiguration Fund (BPRF) to facilitate the conversion of JPSi 120MW combined cycle plant, Bogue Power Plant in Western Jamaica to use natural gas. This plant, which was first commissioned in 2003, was the newest plant in the JPS fleet, and had originally been built to facilitate conversion to dual fuel. 
  Through an international bidding process, the Company forged a partnership with US-based gas supplier, New Fortress Energy, for the introduction of natural gas to
Jamaica. Less than two years later, in 2016, Jamaica celebrated a significant milestone, when LNG was officially introduced into the nationis fuel mix for electricity generation, accounting for approximately 10.0 per cent of JPSi production.
New 190MW Gas-Fired Plant
In 2015, the Government-appointed Energy Sector Enterprise Team (ESET), the Ministry of Energy and the Office of Utilities Regulation commenced the construction of a new power plant to replace its oldest power station in Old Harbour in Central Jamaica. The Company entered into a new Gas Supply Agreement with New Fortress Energy, and through a subsidiary company, in 2017 broke ground for a new 190 MW power plant, which will operate on natural gas. On completion in 2019, the 190MW plant, combined with the Bogue plant, will bring JPSi production from natural gas to approximately 55.0 per cent. With the retirement of the older, less efficient units, and the incorporation of more natural gas, the cost of electricity is expected to become more affordable for Jamaicans.
  More natural gas will be introduced in the countryis overall generation mix, through a 2017 Power Purchase Agreement between JPS and New Fortress South Power Holdings, for the purchase of power from a new gas-fired 94MW power plant to be built in Central Jamaica.
Increasing Renewables
Jamaicais National Energy Policy has set a target of 30.0 per cent renewable energy by 2030. JPS has supported this through the expansion of its own renewable facilities, and by facilitating the addition of approximately 78MW of renewables in 2016, almost doubling the renewable energy on the grid in a single year. This was made possible through Power Purchase contracts with several Independent Power Producers (IPPs) for 36MW of wind energy from BMR Jamaica Wind; 24MW of wind energy from Wigton; and 20MW of solar energy from Content/WRB Solar. 
  In 2017, the Company signed an agreement with Eight Rivers Energy Company for the purchase of power from a new 37MW Solar Power Plant, being built in Western Jamaica. The plant will be the largest solar facility on the island, and is expected to contribute to substantial reductions in carbon emissions from power generation.
Introduction of Hybrid Storage Facility
In 2017, JPS sought and received approval from the regulators for a grid scale energy storage project. Ground was broken in early 2018 for the 24.5MW hybrid energy storage solution, which is reportedly the largest hybrid facility being built in the world at this time. When completed in 2019, the energy storage unit will help to secure grid stability and reliability, in the face of the increasing impact of intermittency from the renewable energy on the grid. 
Modernising the Electricity Grid
JPS has given a commitment to create a smarter, self-healing grid. In the past few years, the Company has upgraded its Grid Control Systems to improve reliability and to accommodate the integration of more variable sources of energy such as solar and wind. The system upgrades include the installation of smart devices that will enable self-healing capabilities and facilitate quicker response from the utility. These include distribution automation switches, reclosers, automatic trip savers, fault circuit indicators, and power quality monitors. In addition to improving reliability, these devices provide data points for grid analysis and stability. In addition, since 2016, JPS has installed over 40 000 smart meters in communities across the island. 
Smart City Technology
In 2016, the country took the first steps towards the introduction of smart city technology in Jamaicais capital, with the roll-out of AMI smart meters in the New Kingston commercial district, along with smart streetlighting, and the implementation of a web portal energy management solution and a pilot smart parking application. The Company also unveiled the countryis first smart home in Western Jamaica in 2016.
Smart Streetlighting
JPS continues to lead the transition to Smart LED (Light Emitting Diode) Streetlighting in the Caribbean. The Company launched a Smart Streetlight project in 2017, and will replace approximately 40 000 Smart LED Streetlights by the end of 2018, as part of a plan to change out the countryis 105 000 traditional High Pressure Sodium (HPS) streetlights over a three-year period. 
Unique Solutions for Customers
Prepaid Service
The Company has introduced a Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) prepaid meter solution, which allows access to electricity for more persons, while giving greater control over actual consumption. PAYG is used as an energy management tool, reporting savings of up to 30 percent on electricity bills.
Community Renewal Programme
The Company has continued to reach out to officially established a Community Renewal programme in 2015, which, through collaboration with Government agencies and NGOs, has sought to address some of the socio-economic challenges faced in these communities. JPS has partnered with the Jamaica Social Investment
Fund (JSIF), USAID, and the Governmentis Rural Electrification Programme (REP).
  In September 2017, under the Annual Tariff adjustment approved by the OUR, a special Community Renewal Rate was approved for JPS customers who are beneficiaries of the Governmentis Programme of Advancement Through Health and Education (PATH). This preferred rate was requested by JPS as a way to help the most vulnerable persons in society access affordable electricity. 
Business Development
In 2017, JPS established a Business Development division, to focus more strategically on identifying and harnessing the new market opportunities for customers, while continuing to support Jamaicais economic development. 
Nation Building
The fourth pillar of JPSi energy strategy is nation-building, through energy efficiency, customer empowerment and energy education initiatives.
Energy Efficiency
JPS has included in its strategy a programme to help customers understand the impact of their behavior on the amount they ultimately pay for electricity. The Company has an ongoing customer education programme to help its customers eliminate waste and use energy efficiently through its customer education efforts. In addition, the Company has introduced even more tangible ways of helping customers. With the launch of its eStore JPS has introduced to customers a range of energy saving devices to help manage their costs and reduce waste. Through its Energy Solutions arm, the company provides energy audits, and energy management training, as well as renewable energy solutions to help customers n especially businesses n reduce their operating costs.
Customer Empowerment
JPS has placed great emphasis on customer engagement. To this end, the Company has expanded the platforms available for information sharing and dialogue with customers. These include expanding the channels for customers to contact the organisation, as well as creating opportunities for more targeted stakeholder messaging. 
  The Company has introduced a Mobile App, and placed greater focus on customer service delivery via online platforms n including Webchat, Facebook and Twitter. The Company also established a consistent presence in the traditional media, enabling customers to interact with its representatives on popular radio discussion programmes. Through an innovative PowerSmart Energy Challenge reality TV show, the Company engaged Jamaicans in the sharing of conservation and energy efficiency information.
In 2017, greater emphasis was placed on involving key stakeholders in conversations on the future of energy\0xF3in Jamaica, and globally. JPS introduced its Letis Talk series, with symposiums on Renewable Energy and Electric Vehicles, the latter being hosted in partnership with the USAID Caribbean Clean Energy Programme. 
Energy Education n the Focus of the JPS Foundation
In 2013, as the primary arm for JPSi Corporate Social Responsibility programme the foundation was launched. The Foundationis areas of focus are: Energy Education, Science, Energy and Technology Innovation, Conservation, Environment & Energy Efficiency Awareness. Since its establishment, the Foundation has focused on partnerships with educational institutions, to include the establishment of model schools, and homework centres. 
  Through its Energy Clubs in high schools, the JPS Foundation assists the participating schools to manage their energy consumption, while providing opportunities for students to build their capacities to be responsible and informed energy consumers, and possible future experts in the sector. 
  The JPS Foundation launched its CSEC Electrical and Electronic Technology Exam Fee Sponsorship programme in 2016. Through this initiative, the JPS Foundation funds the Caribbean Secondary Examination Certification (CSEC) exam fees associated with the Electrical and Electronic Technology course for qualifying students, beginning the 2016/2017 academic year. 
Recognition for Execution of its Energy Strategy
On the international stage, JPSi CEO received the Platts CEO of the Year Award. At the local level, in the same year the Jamaica Institute of Engineers awarded the Company the Best Project of the Year Award, for the Bogue Conversion Project. 
  Additionally, recognition came from organizations such as the American Chamber of Commerce (AMCHAM) and Junior Achievement Jamaica (JAJ) for the Companyis Corporate Social Responsibility programme. 
CASE STUDY ON GOAL 5: GROOTS JAMAICA n SISTREN THEATRE COLLECTIVE
GROOTS International and Huairou Commission, with their large global network of members, and several partner organizations have over the years, developed comprehensive programmes that have provided grassroots women with the opportunity to participate in the policy development process, and contribute to discussions at the global level. GROOTS Jamaica and SISTREN Theatre Collective have been working in partnership with Woman Inc and the Jamaica Household Workers Union to educate and sensitize grassroots women and men on the United Nations 2030 Agenda Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). GROOTS Jamaica and its partners seek to address the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable women, through engagement in participatory action research aimed at tracking conditions facing their communities and securing their livelihoods. 
  In 2017, GROOTS Jamaica facilitated a forum titled \0xECGrassroots Women leading SDG monitoring The objetives were to (i) strengthen collaboration between the local chapter and other public and private sector partners, for the implmenation of the sustainbale development goals, (ii) discuss strategic and mutually beneficial partnerships (iii) identify potential donors to advance the work of grassroots women in Jamaica in support of the SDGs and (iv) discuss the New Urban Agenda, the Sendai Framework, and the Paris Agreement. This forum provided the opportunity for grassroots women to position themselves as agents of change.

Conclusion
he process of preparing the VNR Report for Jamaica enabled reflection and assessment of the SDGs, within the context of the implementation of Vision 2030
Jamaica towards fulfilling the national development agenda. This report has provided the opportunity to assess the status of the implementation of the SDGs, and to share some of the progress and contributions made, and recommendations for further implementation. 
  The implementation and attainment of the SDGs are priorities for Jamaica. Jamaicais commitment to Agenda 2030 is evident in the strides we have made towards implementation thus far, using the pre-established framework of Vision 2030 Jamaica Plan. There is demonstrated strong alignment between Vision 2030 Jamaica and Agenda 2030, highlighted by the MAPS mission, and the SDGs Roadmap which built on the MAPS exercise. Additionally, the establishment of new mechanisms such as the SDGs Oversight Committee and the SDGs Core Group and Secretariat to advance implementation, demonstrates the strength of partnerships and augurs well for the future.
  Among the insights gleaned from the review is that a critical aspect of ensuring the effective implementation of Agenda 2030 will be to improve the inclusion of vulnerable groups, to continuously minimise and eventually eradicate the number of persons leTh behind. Already, programmes designed with this objective have yielded improved outcomes for the youth, demonstrated by a significant reduction in unemployment rates based on data from Jamaicais most recent labour force data for 2018; and for those living below the poverty line, with the latest data indicating not only a decline in the prevalence of poverty but also a reduction in inequality evidenced by an improvement in Jamaicais Gini Coefficient. 
  These gains have stemmed in part from policy decisions to improve social outcomes through the implementation of policies and programmes targetted at vulnerable groups including the Social Protection Strategy and the introduction and maintenance of a social protection floor, which guarantees dedicated expenditure on social programmes in each budget cycle. As such, the continued engagement of the political directorate and Ministries, Department and Agencies is necessary to ensure the development and implementation of policies which are responsive to the needs of the populace; and which will lead to improved outcomes for all.
  Jamaica is in the final stages of concluding another planning cycle for Vision 2030 Jamaica, through the development of the Medium Term Socio-Economic Policy Framework for 2018n2021, and efforts are made to ensure that national development plans for this period are in full alignment with Agenda 2030. Additionally, through Public Investment Management System, all public investment projects are now required to demonstrate their contribution to Agenda 2030 at the concept stage, in keeping with the established evaluation guidelines.
  As Jamaica works towards achieving the SDGs and the 2030 Agenda focus on the accelerators identified under the maps mission to achieve the SDGs will be key priorities. In this regard, continued partnerships with key stakeholders as well as financial and technical assistance from local and international partners, will be required to ensure the effective monitoring and implementation of the SDGs. We recognise that leveraging these partnerships and identifying innovative financing modalities will be particularly critical for future monitoring and evaluation. Specifically, funding support will be required to advance the National Statistical System as well as to further communications and advocacy.
  Jamaica recognizes that it will be particularly important to continue the systematic review process for the SDGs. This will include sharing updates, building awareness and support, localizing and keeping the SDGs in the forefront of the national discourse, to attain the common national goal of making \0xECJamaica, the place of choice to live, work, raise families and do business and accelerate progress to the fulfilment of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
