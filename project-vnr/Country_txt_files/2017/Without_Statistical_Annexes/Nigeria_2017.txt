
1.1  	Key Successes for Celebration 
There are, at the very least, some four areas, as summarised here-below, that are evidently successful and therefore meriting some modicum of national celebration:
I. The Establishment of multi-layer and multi-cluster institutional frameworks for enhanced coordination and SDGs mainstreaming processes   
The President has appointed a Senior Special Assistant to the President (SSAP) on SDGs with responsibility for ensuring both the horizontal and vertical coherence between development policies, plans and strategies. Similarly, an Inter-Ministerial Committee on the SDGs has been established and operational guidelines for the same developed in order to guide the coordinated engagement with Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs). Similar structures have been established at the sub-national levels. 
In order to fully harness available resources and effectively engage other stakeholders, a Private Sector Advisory Group (PSAG) and a Donorsi Forum on the SDGs have recently been inaugurated. Similarly, the Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) Advisory Group on SDGs are already working towards some SDGs targets with giant strides on inclusive education.
In addition, concerted efforts have been made to enhance the legislative and oversight roles of Parliamentarians on the SDGs implementation process. In more specific terms, two select committees on SDGs have been established in the Senate and the House of Representatives.    
As part of the national SDGs advocacy and campaign programme, the OSSAP-SDGs has entered a partnership with the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) to train graduating youths into becoming SDGs champions in their local communities and in various areas of deployment for national service.

	II  	Existence of a Good Policy and Planning Framework
The recently-launched Nigeria Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (NERGP) which is also the basis of the current medium- and short- terms budgeting frameworks is, to a large extent, aligned to the SDGs.  Similarly, many of the current State Development Plans (SDPs), including those of Benue, Taraba, Yobe, Kaduna, Ebonyi, Kano, Jigawa, Anambra and Delta States - to mention just but a few, are aligned to the SDGs. Moreover, the alignment of aid planning, monitoring and evaluation of SDG implementation; and the SDGs data mapping exercise have been concluded and a data supply responsibility framework agreed upon.
	III  	Upscaling the Conditional Grants Scheme 
The Conditional Grants Scheme (CGS) is a counterpart contributory mechanism which incentivizes subnational governments into mobilising resources in order to accelerate progress in the SDGs core areas. The CGS is, in fact, an acclaimed global good practice in so far as the implementation of the global development agenda is concerned and it is thus being scaled up to reflect our strong commitment to the implementation of the SDGs.
	IV.  	Identifying and Targeting the Poor and Vulnerable Groups 
This aspect of identifying the poor and the vulnerable has been achieved through the establishment of a \0xECNational Social Registerii for the poor and vulnerable households. There is a monthly conditional cash transfer of five thousand naira (N5,000) to such households as part of a national social safety net programme.  
1.2  	Key Lessons 
Three major lessons have been learnt out of the entire SDGs implementation exercise. The first is that technology-based, open and transparent progress tracking and reporting systems for nationally agreed targets against set benchmarks is critical for the success of the SDGs implementation. The second lesson is that it is necessary to devise innovative and adaptive practices and programme delivery mechanisms in order to overcome bureaucratic bottlenecks that are often associated with the implementation of national policies and programmes. The third is that, without necessarily downplaying the role of Official Development Assistance (ODA) and debt financing through debt relief gains, domestic resource mobilization and new sources of financing, are critical for the successful resourcing of the SDGs implementation in Nigeria. It implies therefore, that effective global and national partnerships are vital for the SDGs implementation process. 
1.3  	Main Challenges
There are at least three major challenges as summarised hereunder:
(i) Over-reliance on the oil and gas sector; dwindling agricultural production and productivity as well as limited value addition in the agricultural sector: In order to grow the economy, create jobs, address poverty and ensure food security much more than oil and gas is evidently required. The dwindling agricultural productivity is mainly due to the negative impacts of climate change; desertification; natural and man-made disasters; unresponsive /land tenure as well as the general low utilization of mechanized farming.   
(ii) Infrastructural Deficits and Technological gaps: A major challenge to the SDGs attainment is the infrastructural deficit and technology gaps which hinder service provision and application of science, technology and innovations in many spheres of life. 
(iii) Economic Recession and Humanitarian crisis: Economic recession in the country due to fluctuating oil price in the international market and the humanitarian crisis in the North East of the country all present unique challenges that are detrimental to the achievement of the SDGs.  
1.4  	Main Areas in Which Nigeria Needs Support
There are two main areas in which Nigeria will most certainly need support even as it races to the implementation and realisation of the SDGs. 
The first arises from the reality of the current economic recession which implies that the country will need all the support it requires in mobilizing adequate financial and other resources; including from domestic sources and through the traditional (North n South, South n South and triangular cooperation) partnerships. The government has n to its credit- made remarkable advances on efforts that target the combating of illicit financial flows as well as strengthening asset recovery measures and the enforcement of whistle-blower policy as part of National fight against corruption. All these measures are over and above the several fiscal reform initiatives undertaken and which are also expected to contribute to domestic resource mobilization for implementation of the SDGs.
The second area relates to the matter of Technology Transfer and Capacity Building in, among others, data, information and performance management, all which are urgently needed so as to support both the SDGs implementation agenda as well as the attendant process of accountability and tracking of performance.

2.  INTRODUCTION
2.1  	Brief Country Profile and Context
Nigeria is a Federal Republic with thirty-six (36) States, a Federal Capital Territory (FCT), 774 Local Government Areas (LGAs) and some 9, 572 Political wards. The States and FCT constitutes the second tier of government while the LGAs constitute the third tier of government. Nigeria is located in the Western region of Africa with a total land area of 923,768 square kilometres sharing boundaries with the Republic of Niger to the north; Chad to the northeast; Cameroon in the east and southeast; Benin in the west and the Gulf of Guinea in the south. 
The countryis population was projected to be 190 million by end 2016 on the basis of an approved annual population growth rate of 3.2% from the 2006 national population census figure of 140 million. It is thus referred in the countryis MDGs Acceleration Framework of 2013 and the MDGs Report of the same year as the most populous country in Africa, including in the entire black race. Moreover, Nigeria is a multi-ethnic country with over 250 ethnic groups1, and more than 500 different languages and dialects. The official language of Nigeria is English, with a local variety that is called \0xECpidgini.
Whereas historically Nigeria experienced decades of military rule that led to gross under-development and rendering the race to the SDGs somewhat slanted, the country has also had an uninterrupted presidential democracy since 1999 and successfully completed five rounds of general elections.2  It is this more democratic environment that makes the countryis race towards the SDGs more promising.
Following the high economic growth of 4.8% per annum during the 2011 n 2015 period, the onset of the SDGs era coincided with a period depressed economic activity and the coming into office of a new Government elected on the platform of \0xEBChangei and the promise to tackle corruption, improve security and rebuild the national economy. Nigeriais economy contracted by 1.54% in 2016 and 0.52% during the first quarter of 2017. The ongoing economic recession is largely due to the decline in crude oil prices and failure to diversify sources of revenue and foreign exchange beyond oil and has led to loss of government revenue, deaccumulation of forex reserves, devaluation of the local currency, high inflation, capital markets downturn; decline in real sector activity, and loss of jobs. The effects of the current recession have been exacerbated by the humanitarian crisis in the North East of the country occasioned by the insurgency in that region which affected an estimated 10 million people in 2016. It has also been propelled by the militancy and attendant environmental degradation in the Niger Delta region. 
In response to the economic recession, the Government launched the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP) as a Medium-Term Plan covering the period 2017-2020 in order to restore growth while leveraging the countryis abundant human and natural resources. The Plan, founded on the principles of tackling constraints to growth; leveraging the power of the private sector and promoting national cohesion and social inclusion, is aimed at a triad of objectives that includes restoring growth; investing in people and building a globally competitive economy.  The strategy outlines programmes and initiatives that address the economic, social and environmental dimensions of development and in this way, captures the spirit that is consistent with the aspirations of Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Plan also provides a framework for the harmonization and coordination of strategic Federal level policy initiatives aimed at economic recovery and the achievement of the SDGs and those at the sub-national (State and Local Government) level where the most critical development challenges reside and which in turn, suffer from a lack of financial resources and weak institutional capacities. 
Besides the current economic recession, the country faces a host of other development challenges, which have potential to slow down progress towards the SDGs. The high economic growth registered during the first decade of the 2000s was largely non-inclusive.  Consequently, many Nigerians toil under the burden of poverty and unemployment as well as rampant inequality in income and access to basic services. An estimated 62.6% of the population live below the [old] international poverty line (PPP 1.25 $ per day) while some 27.9 % are multi-dimensionally poor.  Unemployment has been on the rise over the past two years, with the rate more than doubling from Q4 2014 figure of 6.4% to the current (Q1 2017) figure of 14.2%. Income inequality, measured by the Gini Coefficient, stands at 43%, implying that inclusive growth remains elusive. Inequality is evident not just with respect to income, but also in terms of access to basic social services and opportunities. When Nigeriais Human Development Index (HDI value = 0.527) is discounted for inequality, it falls to 0.328 which is a loss of 37.8%.  In terms of the SDGs Index which ranks countries based on their performance across the 17 goals, the country is ranked a lowly 141 out of 149 countries with a score of 36.1% against the regional average of 42.5%.  

\0xECEradication of Poverty and Promoting Prosperity in a Changing World"
In a nutshell, the country faces many challenges in her efforts to meet the SDGs, including but not limited to poverty, insecurity, social inequality, the absence of inclusive growth, youth unemployment, gender inequality, limited funding as well as prevalent weak institutional capacities.  Additionally, the country suffers from a huge infrastructural deficit in power, roads and rail networks and food insecurity that is due to low agricultural production and productivity. There is widespread poverty that is compounded with land and ecosystems degradation.  
The Government has taken several initiatives aimed at mainstreaming the SDGs into national policy, planning, budgeting and monitoring and evaluation frameworks. These include, but are not limited to the development of an \0xEBSDGs Transitioning Strategy and Action Plani; the compilation of an MDGs End Point Report (2015) and the development of national SDGs indicators baselines. Other measures  taken include evolving strategies for addressing the data challenges by conducting an SDGs Data Mapping and developing a Data Supply Framework  and \0xEBData Bondi to be signed by all the MDAs; the integration of SDGs into Federal and State level Development Plans; the roll-out of a national advocacy programme; scaling up the implementation of SDGs best practices (programmatic interventions) such as the Conditional Grant Scheme; revitalization and strengthening of institutional capacities for SDGs implementation;  enhanced domestic resource mobilization; conducting an SDGs Needs Assessment and Policy Analysis: and establishing and /or strengthening of smart partnerships with the private sector, civil society organisations and development partners for SDGs implementation. 
The Government has further commenced the implementation of a Social Investment Programme (SIP), complete with a \0xECNational Social Registerii for poor and vulnerable households. Through this programme, poor and vulnerable households receive a monthly conditional cash transfer of five thousand naira (N5,000). The Government has also up scaled the Conditional Grants Scheme (CGS) to sub-national governments to incentivize them into allocating financial resources to priority poverty reduction and social development and thus contribute to the attainment of the SDGs. In addition to an appropriate financing strategy, the Government has made good progress in its anti-corruption campaign by curtailing illicit financial flows, strengthening asset recovery processes and enforcing the whistle-blower and freedom of information policies. These measures have in effect, expanded the available fiscal space and enabled the Government to channel more financial resources to SDGs-related programmes such as the SIP. 
2.2  	Objectives of the Review
Against the backdrop of the aforementioned achievements and while aware that many challenges remain and will need to be overcome if the country is to realise the SDGs, Nigeria volunteered to be among the 44 countries participating in the second round of 2017 National Voluntary Reviews (NVRs) on SDGs. The ultimate objective of the 2017 NVRs is therefore to share the countryis progress and good practices on SDGs implementation and learn from other countries in order to enhance national implementation and coordination mechanisms while also overcoming bottlenecks. The specific objectives are however the following:
(i) To deepen advocacy and awareness on national SDGs targets and on-going efforts towards the implementation of the Agenda 2030; 
(ii) Identify opportunities for enhanced synergies and coherence between Nigeriais national development priorities, the SDGs and other Internationally Agreed Development Goals (IADGs); 
(iii) Learn from other countriesi good practices for strengthening the horizontal and vertical coordination of SDGs implementation; and
(iv) Institutionalize regular stock-taking and peer review as part of the national SDGs monitoring and reporting system. 
2.3  	Methodology and Process of Review 
In line with the global guidelines for conducting and preparing the NVRs and in conformity with section 74 (f) of the Agenda 2030, Nigeria adopted an integrated, participatory, inclusive and evidence-based method in the reportis general preparation. The views and opinions of the Federal Government, CSOs, organized private sector, the academia, parliamentarians, sector MDAs and State governments have been integrated while the evidence has been from authentic and verifiable sources. The representatives of the multi-stakeholders participated in a one-day national consultative workshop where thematic discussions were held to synthesize key information on the level of preparedness and progress that formed the basis of the report.  This was followed, at a later stage, by a national stakeholdersi workshop where the report was validated. The progress reported in this review, thus, includes the collective and independent efforts of both state and non-state actors, including CSOs. In a nutshell, the report is a joint statement of multiple national stakeholders. 
2.4  	Scope and Key Features of the Review 
In general, the review aims to assess the policy environment in place for the implementation of the SDGs and the ultimate realisation of the globally-agreed Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development. It provides information on Nigeriais progress on policy matters as well as the strategic response to the SDGs; the baseline status on 69 select indicators with projections on their path to target (2030). The review also contains highlights on how the country has cultivated greater ownership of the global goals through multipronged sensitization and advocacy campaigns. There is information on how the country has mainstreamed the SDGs into national policies and plans as well as into the budgetary processes while also integrating the three critical SDGs dimensions (the economic; the social and environmental dimensions). 
The review further gives an update on the goals set for the 2017 High Level Political Forum with additional information on goals four and sixteen that are of special interest to the NERGP. It focuses on the policies, programmes and activities of Federal and State governments as well as the CSOs, in relation to the selected SDGs targets and indicators. Information on the progress on institutional mechanisms for effective implementation of the SDGs and resource mobilization initiatives are reported. Conclusively, there is information on key areas of success as well as the challenges encountered; the key lessons learnt as well as areas that will require further learning from other national or international best practices.
2.4.1  	Establishment of the NVR Core Working Group 
The Office of the Senior Special Assistant to the President on SDGs (OSSAP-SDGs) constituted an InterMinisterial and Non-Governmental Core Working Group (CWG) on the 2017 NVR. The primary responsibility of the Group has been the overall management of the consultative processes for information gathering, content standard assurance and responsibility for delivery timelines. Membership of the CWG include representatives of the relevant Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs); International Development Partners (IDPs), Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), the organized private sector, and a Consultant that 
\0xECEradication of Poverty and Promoting Prosperity in a Changing World"
was engaged to support technical processes of the national report development. The CWG held several planning meetings and facilitated national consultative workshops for gathering input for the report. The final compilation, content, as well as, structure of the report follows the NVR guidelines provided in the report of the UN Secretary General. 
2.4.2  National Consultations and Information Gathering Processes 
The first step in the consultative process was the articulation of the relevant sections of the global guidelines as Key Review Questions (KRQ) and Sub Review Questions (SRQ). A total of 3 KRQ and 6 SRW were thus defined and advanced into an information gathering template with sections relevant to the various sections of the report. The template was distributed to the MDAs, State Governments as well as the CSOs and Private Sector Groups on SDGs. The responses received through from the template were collated as the first level of information for the report.  The figure 2.1 below provides a summary of the KRQ and the SRQs. 
FIGURE 2.1:  The KRQs and the SRQs
KRQ-1:  How enabling is the policy and operating environment for SDGs implementation?
\0xEF SRQ-1.1: How has the government facilitated awareness on SDGs and advocated for good level of awareness and national ownership?
\0xEF SRQ-1.2: How has the government integrated the SDGs into its national policy and planning frameworks?
\0xEF SRQ-1.3: How has the government integrated the three dimensions (economic, social & environmental) of SDGs in its national policy framework?
\0xEF SRQ-1.4: What is the progress and status on the Goals and Targets, making reference to data, where available, and strategic initiatives and activities that will drive achievement of the targets? 
\0xEF SRQ-1.5: Is there any national initiative of special attention that aligns with the thematic focus of the high level political forum for 2017?
\0xEF SRQ-1.6: How appropriate is the institutional mechanism set by the government to facilitate horizontal and vertical coordination of SDGs implementation?
KRQ-2:  How well is the country mobilizing financial resources to facilitate implementation of the SDGs?
KRQ-3:  How enabling is the National Statistical System in support of SDGs Data availability?
The second step was a one-day \0xEBNational Consultative Workshopi (NCW) that allowed for deeper presentation and discussion by various stakeholders on pre-informed thematic areas around the reported select SDGs. Participants at the workshop included some 200-plus representatives of select members of the multistakeholders drawn from the following:
? 
Federal Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs);
? 
36 States of the Federation and the Federal Capital Territory;
? 
Committee on SDGs from the National and State Assemblies;
? 
Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), and other gender-based Non-Governmental Organizations 
(NGOs);
? 
International Development Partners (IDPs);
	? 	Private Sector Group;
	? 	The Media; and
	? 	Joint Association of Persons with Disability (JONAPWD).
The NCW also provided an opportunity in which to sensitize the public on the SDGs and the NVRs process and was marked by heightened publicity in the print, electronic and even social media platforms. The NCW programme comprised of two general plenary sessions and six parallel thematic technical sessions for eliciting key information on progress and status of SDGs implementation by each stakeholder. The CSOs served as the Lead Rapporteur, documenting the deliberations at the six technical sessions while the private sector member moderated some of the technical sessions. 
The other sources of information used in preparing this report were desk review of existing national documents and reports such as the Nigeria Vision 20:2020, NERGP, SDPs, Transition Strategy to SDGs, MDGs End-Point Report - among others. The desk review ensured that the report is properly aligned with the official national reports. The Ministry of Budget and National Planning and its National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) were principally involved in the consultations and collaborations in order to get economic and statistical data, respectively. 
The zero-draft of the report was first reviewed by the CWG after which an improved version was circulated to the wider stakeholders for further review, comments and validation. This was followed thereafter, by a National Validation Workshop (NVW) where other emerging additional information was integrated into the report. The report was subsequently ratified by the Inter-Ministerial Core Group on the 2017 NVR.
2.4.3  Support for the Review and Some Notable Constraints
The review process has been funded primarily from national resources within the OSSAP-SDGs.  The United National Development Programme (UNDP) and representative of the CSOs in the CWG supported the process in kind and in terms of technical input. UNDP supported the final synthesis and the professional editing and production of this report. 
There were, however, some notable constraints that impeded the review process, including notably, the following: inadequate lead time for report preparation given that the country commenced the process rather late in March 2017; funding constraints, given that Nigeriais 2017 annual budget was note appropriated by January 2017; and non-readily available information, given that the OSSAP-SDGs had just inaugurated various segments of the institutional and partnership structure. 
\0xECEradication of Poverty and Promoting Prosperity in a Changing World"
3. POLICY AND THE ENABLING ENVIRONMENT
3.0  	Introduction
This section of the review provides information in response to KRQ-1: How enabling is the policy and operating environment for SDGs implementation? In line with the Review Guideline, the response to this KRQ-1 has been provided across 6 SRQs as further elaborated herebelow.
3.1  	Cultivating Nigeriais National Ownership for the SDGs
SRQ-1.1: How has the government facilitated awareness on SDGs and advocated for good level of awareness and national ownership?
3.1.1  	Establishment of an SDG Coordinating Office
Nigeria has demonstrated strong political commitment for national ownership and implementation of the SDGs. As part of this commitment, President Muhammadu Buhari appointed a Senior Special Assistant on the SDGs (SSAP-SDGs) with full mandate of coordinating the SDGs-related interventions; tracking of national progress; reporting on performance as well as managing the operational processes for results.  The Office of the SSAP (OSSAP-SDGs) is located within the Office of the President for optimal political support and authority. The Government has also deployed seasoned public servants and professionals to the OSSAP-SDGs in order to ensure readily available multi-skills, talent-building as well as a reservoir of institutional memory for subsequent lessons and knowledge transfer. 
3.1.2  	Sensitization and Advocacy 
In partnership with relevant stakeholders, the OSSAP-SDGs has undertaken numerous publicity and advocacy programmes in order to create and enhance awareness about the SDGs across the length and breadth of the nation. The awareness process targeted key institutions and decision-makers for purposes of ensuring seamless policy integration and for forging the enabling environment for the proper mainstreaming and implementation of the SDGs within the national fabric. Some of the key national stakeholders targeted in this respect were the sub-national Governments; parliamentarians; heads and staff of Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs), Civil Society Organizations, the Academia, vulnerable population, groups and persons with disability; organized youth groups, Media; heads, and members of traditional institutions - among others. 
In advancing the SDGsi publicity, advocacy and sensitization programme, multiple strategies were deployed in order to ensure behaviour-change, response as well as targeting key messages.  Moreover, the OSSAPSDGs conducted several workshops aimed at educating targeted persons and groups on the SDGs and their potential therein. Policy briefs were prepared; media briefings and appearances were conducted coupled with publications on the main print and electronic media as well as in Social Media platforms.
3.1.3  Availability of SDGs Data, Information and Performance Accountability 
In building from the MDGs experience, the OSSAP-SDGs developed and disseminated Nigeriais MDGs EndPoint Report (2015) as a national case-study of remarkable progress that requires to be further consolidated, deepened and built upon for sustainability. The consolidation was accomplished by working closely with the Development Partners, especially, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) of the UN System of Nigeria; the State Partnership for Accountability, Responsiveness, and Capability (SPARC) Programme of the United Kingdom Department for International Development (DFID), select members of the MDAs, State Governments, and other stakeholders.  Moreover, the OSSAP-SDGs developed a National Strategy on the Transition from the MDGs to the SDGs which provides for appropriate institutional arrangements in building on key lessons from the experience of implementing the MDGs across such a vast population with multiple layers of autonomous Governments within one economy and across various bureaucratic bottlenecks.  The strategy also provides for an operational and regulatory framework for advancing and managing the SDGs implementation and coordination. Indeed, the office also developed a Transition Strategy Action Plan targeting the actual and effective operationalization of the transition strategy within both the horizontal and vertical coordination parameters 
In response to the felt-need for timely availability of SDGs data for tracking, reviews and performance accountability, OSSAP-SDGs conducted an activity on SDGs indicator mapping by data production sources and national and sub-national levels, in collaboration with the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) and the UNDP, Nigeria. While conducting the SDGs-data production mapping activity, an SDGs indicators dictionary was produced which defined each indicator within the national context; the means of data collection (either from survey, survey census, or the System of Administrative Statistics (SAS). This was later advanced to conducting data collation activity from SAS and existing survey reports which led to the establishment of a baseline data on some of the SDGs indicators with a view to building an SDGs Results Framework; indicator performance database as well as a practice of open data principles. The database will be progressively updated as performance information get to be more available.  
Additionally, the Government of Nigeria is progressing towards the establishment of a Presidential Committee on the Assessment and Monitoring of the SDGs to serve as the apex national monitoring, reviews, and performance accountability body for SDGs, with OSSAP-SDGs serving as the designated Secretariat. 
3.2  	Integration of the SDGs into Nigeriais National Development Frameworks 
SRQ-1.2: How has the government integrated the SDGs into its national policy and planning frameworks?
The Strategic Framework
Nigeriais national strategic framework comprises its development policies, plans and strategies which are, in turn, implemented through the various sectoral plans, action plans and annual budgets. This section provides information on how the SDGs have been integrated into key national policy, planning and the legislative frameworks. It provides a historical overview on Nigeria development planning process, the MDGs era and how these flow into the SDGs within the current national policy frameworks and sector plans and budgets. 

The Historical Overview
Nigeria has had a relatively long experience with development planning, beginning with the Colonial Development Plan (1958-1968). Fixed Medium-Term Development Plans and National Rolling Plans were also developed and implemented with mixed results. Other strategic efforts such as the Structural Adjustment Programme; the National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy (NEEDS); the strategy for attaining the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the 7-Point and Transformation Agendas were not effectively implemented, and therefore, recorded only modest success. The weak or poor implementation of these strategic development initiatives contributed to the countryis growth and development constraints. In addition, the limited political will also contributed to the under-achievement. Subsequently, Nigeria adopted a long-term approach to development planning and set for itself the ambitious goal of being among the 20 top economies of the world by year 2020, hence, the development of the Vision 20:2020. Nigeriais Vision 20: 20203 is a perspective plan as well as an economic business plan that is intended to make the country one of the top 20 economies of the world by the year 2020, with a growth target of not less than $900 billion in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and a per capita income of not less than $4,000 per annum. 
The three Pillars of the NV 20:2020 and their alignment to the three dimensions of the SDGs are indicated in the table 3.1.
TABLE 3.1: 	The three pillars of NV20:20 and their strategic alignment to three SDGs Dimensions
ONE
Guaranteeing the wellbeing and productivity of the people
Social dimension
TWO
Optimizing the key sources of economic growth
Economic dimension
THREE
Fostering sustainable social and economic development
Environmental dimension

As part of the incorporation of SDGs into the national strategic policy frameworks, Nigeria has more recently launched and is implementing its Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (the NERGP)4. The NERGP is a sustainable development strategy that is as aligned with the SDGs in both intent and content and serves as Nigeriais National Medium-Term Plan for 2017 n 2020.  The NERGP strategy was developed for restoring economic growth while also leveraging on the ingenuity and resilience of the Nigerian people. It spells out the governmentis roadmap for security improvement; war against corruption as well as general economic revitalization and is a compendium to the governmentis sectoral plans for agriculture and food security; energy and transport infrastructure as well as for industrialization and social investments. Moreover, the NERGP consists of plans aimed at driving economic growth in order to achieve a seven percent (7%) growth rate by 2020.  Quite clearly, the NERGP aims to restore sustained economic growth while promoting social inclusion and laying the foundations for long-term structural change. It focuses on providing macro-economic stability, stimulating performance in priority sectors and tackling critical constraints to long-term growth. The strategic policy objectives directly provide for the needed policy platform that should trigger supportive initiatives for achievement across the 17 SDGs.  The other notable national SDGs incorporation initiatives include the environmental restoration projects undertaken in the Niger Delta which clearly demonstrate the Federal Governmentis determination to bring environmental sustainability to the forefront of its policies.
In a nutshell, Nigeria has established an unprecedented and enabling policy environment that will support the implementation of the SDGs and realisation of the 2030 targets. To this end, the implementation strategy focuses on prioritizing the identified strategies; establishing clear systems of accountability for well-defined assignment of responsibilities; setting targets and developing detailed action plans; allocating resources to prioritized interventions; creating an enabling policy and regulatory environment; developing an effective monitoring and evaluation system to track progress, and; using an effective and an-all-encompassing communications strategy. To ensure and guarantee the much-needed political oversight for delivery, a Presidential Delivery Unit (PDU) has been established within the Office of the Vice President with express mandate to facilitate and drive the implementation of key NERGP priorities. The PDU also provides an additional platform that should stimulate and drive the SDGs implementation for results. 

The table 3.2 herebelow, demonstrates the clear incorporation and policy linkage between the national strategic policy objectives in the Nigeriais NERGP and the 17 SDGs.

3.2 1  	SDGs integration into Sector Plans and the National Budget 
As is already apparent, the SDGs programmes and projects have been broadly spread to almost all the MDAs that are directly or even indirectly connected with the 17 SDGs and targets. There is specific and direct focus on education, health, the environment, youth development, women and social development, agriculture and water resources. For budgeting, the country has adopted the principles of Zero Based Budgeting (ZBB), with the multi-year budget planning framework such as the Medium-Term Fiscal Framework (MTFF) and the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) as well as the Medium-Term Sector Strategy (MTSS). Indeed, Nigeria continues to strengthen her commitment to integrating SDGs into the national framework through her 2017 Appropriation Bill, itself a strong demonstration of the integration of SDGs into programmatic funding in the country.  
The table 3.3 below, provides indicative highlights of eleven (11) SDGs that have been programmatically linked with the national programmatic objectives in order to further progress towards achieving Agenda 2030.

3.3  	Integrating the three SDGs Dimensions into National Policies and Plans
SRQ-1.3: How has the government integrated the three dimensions (economic, social & environmental) of SDGs in its national policy framework?
Nigeria has long given emphatic attention to the issues of economic growth, social development and environmental sustainability within her long-term and medium-term development plans (NV20:2020 and NERGP 2017-2020, respectively). There has been adequate integration of the three dimensions of SDGs (economic development5, social inclusion, and environmental sustainability) into the national development plans (NV 20:2020 and NERGP). The agricultural and poverty reduction strategies targeting increasing food production, creating employment, and enhancing the economic capacity of the citizens is linked to the economic dimension of the SDGs. In 2016, the federal government developed the Strategic Implementation Plans (SIPs) that informed the 2016 Budget of Change as a short-term intervention measure for meeting the three SDGs dimensions.  As a follow-up to the SIP, Nigeriais Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (the NERGP) which is a Medium-Term Plan for the period 2017 n 2020, was prepared. The NERGPis three building blocks or thematic focus areas are on the following:
1. Restoring Growth;
2. Investing in our people; and
3. Building a globally competitive economy.
3. 3.1 	Integration of the Social Dimension of SDGs into the NERGP
Nigeria recognizes the emerging need for social development and has, accordingly, designed appropriate social development policies and programmes targeting health and education. The aim is to ensure healthy lives and the promotion of well-being for all at all ages, in line with SDG-3. The policies will also ensure inclusive and equitable education while also promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all. 
With a frank acknowledgement of her ranking at 137 on infant mortality out of 140 countries and  52 years as the national life expectancy average; only 59% proportion of births attended to by skilled personnel; a primary net enrolment ratio of 54%; some 10,000,000  school age children out of school; 63% of children in rural areas unable to read at all; 53% of infant and maternal death attributable to malnutrition; 24% of children under the age 5 underweight, and; 17,600,000 unemployed and unemployable youth in Nigeria, the Government of Nigeria has committed itself to pursuing strategic initiatives that will enhance better performance for these  health and education indicators. Any improvements on these social development indicators, will most directly imply improvements in the SDGs targets and indicators and especially, with respect to Goals 3 and 4. 
In view of the foregoing, some of the relevant policy initiatives as articulated in the NERGP include the following:
For Health:
	? 	Revitalize the primary healthcare system
	? 	Roll out National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS)
	? 	Strengthen delivery beyond the primary health care system
    ? 	Partner with the private sector to construct model mega-health centres ? 	Build the capacity of health care personnel to improve service delivery. For Education
? Partner with State governments and the private sector to establish best-in-class vocational and technical institutes
	? 	Improve teacher quality by incentivizing performance and building capabilities
	? 	Improve the quality of education by strengthening quality assurance
? Increase investment to stimulate more academic candidates to study Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) across the country 
? 	Improve funding mechanisms to incentivize education performance and increase access ? 	Prioritize education for girls and infrastructure development.
3.3.2 	Integration of the Economic Dimension of SDGs into the NERGP  
Nigeria recognizes that the high unemployment rate among the youth is one of the challenges that hinders the overall growth of the economy. The youth constitute about 45% of Nigeriais total population and the extent of youth unemployment is therefore alarming. For this reason, the Government is set to strengthen partnerships with the Private sector with a view to expanding job creation and youth development opportunities within major sectors that are also a major contributor to growth of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
The Government has accordingly, defined key policies on \0xECJob Creation and Youth Empowerment within the NERGP. The policy aims to reduce unemployment from 13.9 per cent (Q3 2016) to 11.23 per cent by 20206 by creating over 15 million direct jobs between 2017 and 2020 or an average of 3.75 million jobs per annum. It will also support the private sector to maximize its job creation potential in order to complement Governmentis direct job creation initiative and it will aim to improve workforce employability through targeted skill-building programmes. To drive the effective implementation and realisation of this Policy, strategic initiatives have been designed around the following four key areas: 
? Agribusiness and agro-allied industries; with the aim of enabling mass employment in the formal and informal sectors due to its high domestic demand, potential for import substitution and expanding opportunities from increased yields and raw material processing;
? Construction; itself a priority sub-sector recognised in the NERGP and identified as one of the major contributors to economic growth due to upcoming major public works programmes scheduled to respond to infrastructure and housing deficits in the country;
? ICT and digital technology development for youth; identified in the NERGP as one of the subsectors that will stimulate economic growth due to its strong potential to create employment, transform labour productivity and create new economic sectors; and
? Wholesale and retail trade; identified to have low entry barriers hence its attractiveness to the many unemployed youth. The aim is to introduce initiatives and support facilities that will expand this entry point. 
In addition to all these, the country is working towards reviewing her national policy on population management with a view to reducing the effect of population growth rate on economic growth and development. The review will consider best practice population management initiatives of other countries in order to inform policy measures that are to be pursued. 
3.3.3 	Integration of the Environmental Dimension of SDGs into the NERGP
Nigeria has properly integrated contemporary environmental concerns as an integral part of the national development policy and plan. The policy on environmental sustainability has been articulated at section 5.6 of the NERGP with five stated objectives; including:
(i) To promote  the sustainable management of natural resources; 
(ii) To address severe land degradation and desertification issues; 
(iii) To attract financing for projects on sustainable development; 
(iv) To reduce gas flaring by 2 percentage points a year so that it is eliminated by 2020; and (v) 	To install an additional 3,000 MW of solar systems over the next 4 years. 

BOX 3.1:  Ogoni Land Clean-up and Potentials for Sustainable Development
The eventual clean-up of Ogoni land will provide opportunities for Nigeriais progress and calming down the restive youth of the affected region. The situation assessment by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) commission, recommends environmental remediation which could last for upwards of 30 years and to be sponsored by the oil companies concerned alongside government counterpart contribution. Potential Benefits
\0xEF Provision of employment opportunities for the restive youth and professionals in Ogoni Community and environs
\0xEF Expansion of land and water space for farming, aquatic lives and the entire Agricultural ecosystem
\0xEF Reduction in crude oil vandalization and criminality
\0xEF Increase in oil production and corresponding revenue to national treasury
\0xEF Savings from security bills that could be re-invested to sustainable development initiatives.




Some highlights on the key strategies that are already defined in the NERGP towards actualizing these policy objectives, include the following nine specific strategies:
(i) Increase the number of households transiting from kerosene to cooking gas n Liquefied National Gas (LNG) to 20 per cent by 2020; 
(ii) Increase the number of households replacing kerosene lanterns with solar lamps by 20 per cent by 2020; 
(iii) Implement projects under the countryis Great Green Wall initiative to address land degradation and desertification and support communities adapting to climate change (e.g. 
by planting trees); 
(iv) Implement environmental initiatives in the Niger Delta region (e.g. by continuing the Ogoni Land clean-up and reduce gas flaring); 
(v) Raise a Green Bond to finance environmental projects; 
(vi) Establish one forest plantation in each state;
(vii) Rehabilitate all forest reserves and national parks to enhance eco-tourism;
(viii) Establish a functional database on drought and desertification; and
(ix) Encourage and promote the development of green growth initiatives.  
At the sub-national level, many States such as Lagos and Rivers are proactively incorporating the three sustainable development dimensions into their SDPs and related programmes. The Lagos State Development Plan (2012 -2025) is for instance structured into economic; Infrastructure; social as well as environmental development with each thematic area having detailed strategic directions, programmes and activities outlined for implementation. 
Within the CSOs on SDGs, ActionAid Nigeria is currently supporting programmes that aim at enhancing climate resilient sustainable agriculture in three States (Kogi, Kwara and Delta). Another CSO member (Fresh and Young Brains Development Initiatives, FBIN) has engaged in the use of climate smart agriculture and agro-business in promoting food security and employment. 
3.3.4  Integrating the Principle of \0xECLeave No One Behind in the NERGP
The SDGs implementation framework that is being adopted in Nigeria places emphasis on the principle of \0xECleaving no one behind. For this reason, an entire section of the NERGP is devoted to policy statements and programmes set to enhance social inclusion with the aim of ensuring that no one is left behind. More significantly, Nigeria is recognised as a peculiarly large country with diverse developmental characteristics, experiencing variations on issues of exclusion right across regions and across subnational Governments. Exclusion issues are however higher in regions faced with humanitarian and security crises such as in the North-East and in the Niger Delta regions which have led to multiple camps of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), vandalism, environmental degradation and disaffection, among other undesirable consequences. 
In view of the foregoing, the Government has prioritised Social inclusion within the NERGP with specific objectives stated as follows:
(i) Increase social inclusion by enhancing the social safety net for the poor and the vulnerable; and
(ii) Address region-specific exclusion challenges, particularly in the North East and the Niger Delta. 
Through all these policies, the Government aims to increase social safety net programmes targeted at the vulnerable and also to sustain the Conditional Cash Transfer programme to reach 1 million of the poorest and most vulnerable households, as captured in the Social Register. The government also aims to upscale the Home-Grown School Feeding Programme to provide a meal a day to at least 6 million primary school children (and also support the agriculture sector); enhance the N-Power programme aimed to providing skilled and unskilled youth with decent jobs; expand Market Money programme for women to strengthen the financial inclusion scheme and access to micro finance for market women. Other measures are aimed at introducing social programmes for the aged and physically challenged; a national relief programme for the aged; launch of a national programme for the physically challenged and other vulnerable groups, as well as design of infrastructure to enable access for the physically challenged, just to mention but a few.
Finally, the CSOs in the Nigeria are also making commendable progress in contributing to the national effort aimed at ensuring that no one is left behind. For instance, the African Foundation for Environment and Development (AFED) provided free training programmes for retirees, artisans, traders, women and youth on poultry farming and has trained over 700 Nigerians. Other members of the CSO Group on SDGs, ( JONAPWD and Women 2030) have facilitated the development of an inclusive education policy in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) of Nigeria, which was achieved through a collaborative process with the relevant government Agencies. 
3.4  	Progress on Specific Goals and Targets 
SRQ-1.4:  What is the progress and status on the Goals and Targets, with specific reference to data, where available, and strategic initiatives and activities that will drive achievement of the targets?
The Overview 
Nigeria has put in place appropriate policy and programme initiatives that will extensively contribute towards achieving some of the SDGs targets and indicators. Programmes and activities of some CSOs and the private sector are already well aligned with the SDGS. Status and outlook performance information for selected sixty-nine SDGs (69) indicators are discussed in this section alongside the relevant policy and programmes undertaken by Federal and State governments.  The activities by CSOs that directly relate to the achievement of these targets are also discussed in detail. The section also presents the baselines for each of the 69 indicators, the 2030 targets and the derived, through simple linear interpolation, 2020 targets which give an idea of where the country should be by 2020 when the current NERGP lapses, assuming a steady and un-interrupted linear progress towards the 2030 target. 

3.4.1  	End Poverty in all its Forms (Goal 1)	
Poverty eradication remains one of the major focus areas for the Government of Nigeria. Given the poverty profile of 62.6%7, the Federal Government as well as the other two tiers of government are aggressively pursuing strategies that will eliminate poverty in Nigeria. To begin with, the government is implementing a national Social Investment Programme which focuses on providing Social Safety Nets for the poor, welfare for the unemployed and job creation and skills enhancement with a target of creating about 3 million jobs. Access to improved water source by the population currently stand at 60% and expected to increase to 73.6% by 2020 resulting in improvement on the levels of sanitation while also reducing water borne and other infectious diseases. 
The National Social Investment Office located within the Vice Presidentis office is coordinating the Social Investment Programme that targets the poor and the vulnerable. The programme will create a database for the unemployed youths and will formulate a programme designed to cushion the immediate and devastating effects of poverty. The primary objective is to empower the poor and the vulnerable while also unleashing programmes that will eventually take them out of the poverty bracket. To this end, the government has formulated a draft National Social Security Policy through the Ministry of Budget and National Planning. The document is to be ratified by the Federal Executive Council (FEC). In the meantime, the draft policy commits to dedicate national resources for the improvement of the lives of citizens and it also strengthens the role of social protection in helping to distribute resources more broadly.
Given the aforementioned background, the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) has leveraged on its social reforms agenda to ensure a pro-poor, gender disaggregated expenditure framework within the MediumTerm Expenditure Framework (MTEF). The underlying goal is to produce an inclusive budget that will ensure equity and justice in the distribution of national resources.  The table 3.4.1 herebelow summarises the goal 1 indicators alongside the 2015 baseline and the projected 2020 targets and more fundamentally, the 2030 targets in line with the SDGs and Agenda 2030 aspirations.

Federal Policy and Programme Drivers Leading Towards Goal 1 Targets 
The Government of Nigeria articulated the Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) Programme as a direct response to address the state of endemic poverty. The programme provides targeted cash transfers to the poor and vulnerable households with the final aim of graduating them out of poverty.  A total of 765,760 beneficiaries are to be selected (80 beneficiaries from each political ward across the 774 Local Government Areas) with the target to be achieved of 30% in the first year; 50% in the second year and 20% in the third year. The programme has provided hope and succour for the old, widows, the physically challenged and the sick in villages and rural communities.
To ensure increased access to primary and secondary schools, a Home-Grown School Feeding Programme (HGSFP) was launched targeting 5.5 million primary school pupils for three years. The programme is aimed at increasing the enrolment and completion rate at the primary school level.  It will also serve to create jobs (via recruitment of cooks) and raise demand for local agricultural produce since the programme also places emphasis on building a community value chain.  The local production and manufacturing of cooking utensils is yet another added value. 
The Government recognizes that creating a vibrant and viable MSME sector is the only solution to creating a strong economy and getting the majority of Nigerians to have a sustainable livelihood. To respond to this objective, the Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme (GEEP) was created with the aim of providing financial services access to traders, market women and women cooperatives; artisans and Medium, Small and Micro Enterprises (MSMEs); enterprising clusters/youth; farmers and agricultural workers. It is a 3-year programme targeting 1 million traders, women cooperatives and market women; 200,000 MSMEs; 260,000 enterprising youth; 200,000 farmers and agricultural workers.
Similarly, the N-Power Programme was designed to help young Nigerians acquire and develop life-long skills to become solution providers in their communities and players in the domestic and global market. It is created for graduate youths between the ages of 18-35 and expected to last for 2 years with a targeted reach of 500,000 youths in three years. The programme pays N30,000 as stipend to participating graduates and payment is made through mobile banking which enables it to get to those in remote areas. 
Sub-National Government Level Polices and Programmes for Goal1
At the subnational level, States have been actively involved in implementing various poverty eradication programmes. Some of the programmes include CCT, Youth Empowerment, Livelihood, Community Development, School subsidies/fee waivers; vocational training and public works. The various programmes are designed to empower the poor and assist them get out of poverty in a sustainable manner. 
Most States in Northern Nigeria operate and manage a CCT aimed at reducing girlsi dropout rates due to early marriages; specifically during the transition period from primary to secondary school. This has contributed significantly in reducing gender disparity and in promoting the education of the girl-child. Moreover, some states operate a CCT for households with school-aged children. 
New innovations like the \0xEBUnconditional Cash Transferi programme (UCT) provides social security allowance for the physically disabled people and the elderly. This empowers people living with disability to earn a living and engage in vocations that will eventually get them out of poverty. 
Home Grown School Feeding Programme covering kindergarten and primary school pupils is working effectively in some States. In most cases, it is a partnership arrangement between Federal and State governments. The Federal Government provides the subsidy for the programme and the state can make their own investment and increase the pool of beneficiaries. Findings already suggest that the programme has resulted in an increase in enrolment rates; retention and completion; improvements in the health of the children; empowerment of cooks as well as in improvements in the local economy.
Finally, some states are operating the \0xEBVolunteer Corps Schemei for unemployed graduates desirous of operating their own business with the objective of imparting skills to graduates and enable them access funds to commence small businesses. 
Civil Society Organizations Policy Initiatives for Goal 1
Most CSOs partner with donors and Government in implementing programmes to end hunger in Nigeria. The \0xEBFresh and Young Brainsi Development Initiativesi (FBIN) focuses on agriculture, entrepreneurship and climate change under the organizationis Youth Farm (Yfarm) and Volunteer for Life (VFL) projects aimed at empowering young people to be economically independent and be able to generate own incomes.
Angel Support Foundation embarked an aggressive programme on food security and improved nutrition in schools. They worked extensively to empower women and girls at the sub-national level. The National Poverty Eradication Programme (NAPEP) and the National Poverty Eradication Council (NAPEC) worked on several poverty initiatives in collaboration with the Gender Advocacy for Justice (GAJI II) in order to empower women, youths and the physically challenged to create own income. 
Action Aid in FCT trained 6,000 women and youths on livelihood schemes such as Garri processing in six skills acquisition centres with 116 grinding mills. Livestock and other petty trading was coordinated in a 50- business awareness session for women in seclusion and persons with disabilities.  
The \0xEBWomen Environmental Programmei (WEP) with funding support from the Federal Ministry of Water Resources trained over 200 women and girls in Taraba, Osun, Delta, Abia, Bauchi, Plateau, and Kebbi states for skills acquisition and livelihood support programmes on water facility maintenance and management. The WEP also trained women on water and sanitation related skills such as soap and detergent making, repairs of water pumps, operations of water kiosk-among other skills. 
3.4.2  End Hunger, Achieve Food Security; Improved Nutrition and Promote Sustainable Agriculture (Goal 2)
The Overview
As the threat of hunger and food insecurity looms in most part of Sub-Saharan Africa, Nigeria already embarked on a review as far back as 2006. The aim was to achieve a \0xEBzero hungeri target and provide nutritious food to its teeming population. The prevalence of undernourishment reflected the fact that some 25.5% of the population was lacking adequate and improved nutrition. At the same time, severe food insecurity within the population based on the Food Insecurity Experience Scale stood at 26.4% based on data from the National Bureau of Statistics. 
In addition, there was a stunting or delayed growth prevalence of 37.45% among children of kindergarten; 37.4% for school age and 15% severe cases of malnutrition for under 5 children. The Government's response was to embark on an aggressive growth enhancement scheme to improve the yield of agricultural commodities. Huge investments were made on the setting up of irrigation sites for farmers in order to provide the platform for cultivation of agricultural products all year round. 
Overall, the trajectory to end hunger is on course, particularly given the strong collaboration among different stakeholders with the aim of improving nutrition and promoting sustainable agricultural development programmes. The table 3.4.2 summarises the Goal 2 indicators against the 2015 baseline, a 2020 projected target and finally the 2030 SDG (Agenda 2030) target.

Federal Policy and Programme Drivers Leading Towards Goal 2 Targets 
There are at least seven specific federal policy and programme drivers as summarised herebelow aimed at the realisation of the Goal two (2) targets: 
(i) 	The Green Alternative Agriculture Promotion Policy
To consolidate on the gains of the Agricultural Transformation Agenda (ATA) that was launched by the previous administration and which recognizes agriculture as a business, the Green Alternative Agriculture Promotion Policy, 2016-2020 was introduced to boost food production in the country. The objective is to achieve self-sufficiency in food production, reduce import, stimulate exports and create jobs. As incentives, the government will provide access to land, inputs, storage, processing, marketing and trade; including access to finance. Other areas covered by the Green Alternative are the promotion of agribusiness, investment development, institutional setting and roles, youth and women, infrastructure, research and innovation as well as nutrition security.
(ii) 	Staple Crops Processing Zones (SCPZ) 
The government similarly channelled energy on attracting private sector agribusinesses under the Staple Crops Processing Zones (SCPZ) platform. The concept is to set up processing plants in zones of high food production and to process commodities into food products. The SCPZ will link farmers in clusters to food manufacturing plants.

(iii) Nigeria Incentive-Based Risk-Sharing System for Agricultural Lending (NIRSAL) 
The NIRSAL is an innovative mechanism targeted at de-risking lending to the agricultural sector. It is structured to provide the singular transformational and one bullet solution to breaking the seeming jinx in Nigeriais agricultural lending and development addressing both the agricultural value chains and financing. Ultimately, NIRSAL will promote agricultural industrialization process through increased food production and processing.
(iv)  Rural Finance Institution Building Programme (RUFIN)  
The RUFIN is a Loan Agreement of US$27.2 million between the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the Federal Government of Nigeria. The central objective of the programme is to develop and strengthen Micro Finance Banks (MFBs), other member-based Micro Finance Institutions (MFls), by enhancing the access of the rural populace to basic banking services. This is to expand and improve agricultural productivity and Micro-Small Rural Enterprises.
(v) 	Anchor Borrowersi Programme (ABP) 
The ABP is a Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) initiative designed to lift thousands of small farmers out of poverty and generate millions of jobs for unemployed Nigerians. It is to complement the Growth Enhancement Support (GES) Scheme of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture by graduating GES farmers from subsistence farming to commercial production.
(vi)  Commercial Agricultural Credit Scheme (CACS)
The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) in collaboration with the Federal Government of Nigeria, represented by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (FMARD) established the Commercial Agriculture Credit Scheme for promoting commercial agricultural enterprises in Nigeria. This is a subcomponent of the Federal Government of Nigeriais Commercial Agriculture Development Programme (CADP) and the fund is to complement other special initiatives of the Central Bank of Nigeria in providing concessionary funding for agriculture such as the Agricultural Credit Guarantee Scheme (ACGS) which is mostly for small scale farmers, Interest Draw-back scheme and Agricultural Credit Support schemeamong other.
(vii) Youth Enterprise with Innovation in Nigeria (YouWiN) 
This is an innovative business plan competition aimed at job creation by encouraging and supporting aspiring entrepreneurial youths in the country to develop and execute business ideas. The YouWiN Programme is a collaborative effort of the Ministries of Finance, Communication Technology and Youth Development that launches an annual Business Plan Competition (BPC) for aspiring young entrepreneurs in Nigeria in line with the Federal Governmentis drive to create more jobs for Nigerians. Sub-National Government Level Policies and Programmes for Goal 2
Most States in Nigeria set up skills acquisition centres to train the youth, women and those living with disability. The trainees are trained and provided with agricultural inputs like fertilizer, to boost their yield.  Agricultural extension services and programmes such as intervention in agricultural processing for crops like rice, yam and cassava are also provided and achieved through land development scheme and provision of farming equipment. 
Similarly, the Conditional Cash Transfer is extended to extremely poor families in order to address the hunger menace. The Education for Employment Programme in Abia is designed to create opportunities for youth and women to harness their skills and set up their own business. The programme is managed and operated in collaboration with polytechnics and other institutions of higher learning to train youths to be self-employed. In addition, extensive support is also given to agricultural based cooperative societies. Civil Society Organizations Policy Initiatives for Goal 2
Civil Society Organizations in Nigeria are playing an important role in the quest to end hunger, achieve food security and improve nutrition in Nigeria. Notable among them is the Zero Hunger Programme headed by former President, H.E Olusegun Obasanjo. The programme entails improved groundnut farming in various communities and boosting of rice production. 
The Caritas Organization has extended CCT to 1500 families in Sokoto and Bauchi to curb the menace of endemic poverty and disease.  This programme has provided hope and means of livelihood to so many families in those part of Northern Nigeria.  Another key programme is the Savings Internal Loan Scheme in Benue and Kogi states. This programme has created a critical pool of funds for lending to small business. Supply of solar lamps and energy saving devices to 7,800 families in the North East and Cross River state is designed to improve their energy requirements.  Supply of Agricultural inputs to women groups in Adamawa and Borno State is meant to boost food production.  This is intended to empower the women to earn income and fend for their families. 
Women Environmental Programme (WEP) has trained over 500 agricultural extension workers on \0xECCommunicating and understanding climate information to the rural farmers in three states of Benue, Niger and Plateau. This project is intended to empower the extension workers to understand the effects of climate change and pass the information across to the rural farmers on farming practices and seedlings.
3.4.3  Ensure Healthy Lives and Promote the Well-being for all at all Ages (Goal 3)
The Overview
Nigeriais human development indices in the health sector remain abysmally low and this portends complex challenges in the health care delivery system. As enunciated in the NERGP, the top priority is to improve the availability, accessibility, affordability and quality of health services by increasing access to primary health care services, expanding health coverage and improving the quality of the services provided.8  The plan is to provide a primary health care facility in each ward across the nation in order to improve access to services and provide sustainable financing with the objective of reducing infant and maternal mortality.  
The government has rolled out the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) in addition to promoting tertiary and the Public Primary Pupils Social Health Insurance Programme to provide quality health services to students and pupils in middle and lower-income socio-economic levels who are unlikely to have coverage. To also accommodate the poor, a Mobile and Community Health Insurance Programme has been rolled out. About 59 % of women were attended to by skilled health attendants both during and after child birth in 2015. The under- five mortality was 89 for every 1000 births while the incidence of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infections, Tuberculosis and Malaria was reduced. In light of the economic recession, substance, alcohol abuse and suicide rates are emerging health issues in Nigeria. While support has come through development partners in the areas of reproductive health and immunization, more remains to be done to stem the tide of teenage pregnancy and Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs).

Federal Policy and Programme Drivers Towards Achieving Goal 3 Targets 
The Federal Governmentis main priority is to reduce infant and maternal mortality through the revitalization of health systems. The target is to establish at least one functional primary health centre (PHC) in each political ward across every local government in order to improve access to health care. Health care workers are recruited and provided with service allowance and basic amenities to work in rural communities and hard to reach areas. Modern health care equipment and drugs are supplied and distributed at affordable rate.
An estimated new infection rate of 264 for every 1,000 uninfected persons for HIV and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) will be reduced significantly through the provision of anti-retroviral medication to people living with the disease. The prevention of mother to child transmission is also accorded priority. Government also deemed it necessary to create projects to scale up immunization, roll back malaria and other measures for the eradication of polio, malaria, measles and yellow fever. 
To combat ailments like cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and respiratory disease, the government intends to invest in tertiary health care institutions in partnership with the National Sovereign Investment Authority and other relevant stakeholders to establish diagnostic centers in all States8.  A comprehensive programme will be developed through e-health mechanism to link specialized hospitals to rural communities via mobile tele-medicine to increase access to quality health care. 
Improvement in Healthcare infrastructure under CCT Health Systems Development Programme will boost funding for the provision of vital equipment, upgrading of health facilities and recruitment of first class health professionals. Partnership with private sector and Nigeria Diaspora organizations will result in the development of at least one mega-health centre in each State to provide high-quality preventive and curative healthcare. The Diaspora medical assistance programme will also assist in attracting the best set of core medical professionals from all parts of the world to improve and raise the standard of our health care system. 
Sub-National Governments Policies and Programmes for Goal 3
Most sub-national government health policies and programmes prioritize reduction in maternal and child morbidity by implementation of evidence based and cost-effective interventions. States operate and manage Primary Health Care under One Roof (PHCUOR) programme to improve quality of service delivery and prudent management of resources. Kaduna State offers free healthcare for pregnant women and children under 5.  Communities are also involved in the health planning and service delivery system of the state. CSOs, NGOs and Community Based Organizations (CBOs) operating at grassroots level play critical role in increasing awareness to increased access to care and ensuring programme outcomes.  In Ebonyi State with a Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) of 310 per 100, 000 live births, the State Government released about N2.1 Billion as grants to six rural /mission hospitals in partnership with government on improvement of maternal, new born and child health.9
Programmes on expanded infrastructure and harnessing pool of qualified staff is an integral component of the health system development strategy.  This involves training and capacity building for healthcare professionals. Yobe State has been able to deploy more resources to the funding of the School of Health Technology and College of Nursing and Midwifery.10  This project will assist in providing a pool of the critical sector skilled personnel to service the health institutions in the state. 
The recruitment and incentivizing of qualified health personnel is vital to improved health care services. The Niger State implements enhancement in condition of service to attract and retain staff through full implementation of Consolidated Medical Salary Structure (CONMESS) and Consolidated Health Salary Structure (CONHESS) as well as by providing other incentives,11 thereby contributing immensely in raising the morale of the health care professionals in the state.  Special incentives are also made available to those that work in rural and hard to reach areas to expand coverage and access to quality care. Improvement of Doctor to population ratio has worked well through recruitment of qualified Doctors and provision of incentives to work in the rural communities.12
States recognize the need to have adequate data to plan for their health development strategies. Extensive projects are ongoing in most states to roll out the Health Management Information Systems and to improve health data collections, collation and reporting. States collect data through the review of national and state level facility data and they have undertaken a trend and comparative analysis of what is obtainable elsewhere in line with good practice.13 Strengthening the data collection mechanism through the National Health Management Information System (NHMIS) remains critical in planning healthcare development and delivery programmes.14
While the NHIS has worked well in expanding coverage for most Nigerians, States have designed their own version of the comprehensive insurance scheme to provide coverage for their own citizens. Delta Health Insurance Scheme is strategically designed to tackle a wide variety of ailments and diseases.16 The addition of the state version provides alternative to healthcare financing in improvement in data collection through the interrogation of NHMIS.15 Development of access to alternative healthcare financing system through roll out of the community healthcare insurance scheme expands the coverage to the poor and those at the bottom of the pyramid.  
Establishment of mobile Health Care clinic and Implementation of free rural healthcare scheme are some of the innovative ways most State governments are increasing access to quality healthcare. Many rural communities are mired in traditional practices and sometimes are reluctant to access quality health care with preference to unskilled health care personnel, with its associated consequences. The mobile health care clinic enables services to get closer to citizens and increases their chances to access quality and safer medical services.
Programmes that are designed towards reduction in the scourge of HIV and AIDS, Tuberculosis (TB) and Malaria are common among stakeholders in the health sector. Most states have established State Agency for the Control of AIDS (SACA) to institutionally coordinate public health measures deployed in the last decade expanding prevention, through advocacy for increased spending.  The aim is to reduce the prevalence rate of HIV and AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. Other services include clinical consultation, counselling and testing for HIV, antiretroviral therapy and ambulance services.  
Civil Society Organizations Initiatives for Goal 3
Most civil society organizations in Nigeria are involved in advocacy, monitoring and evaluation of health care projects. Education as a Vaccine (EVA) has worked extensively in mobilizing youths for political lobbying and advocacy towards the implementation of the SDGs.16  EVA became part of the ACT 2015 Global Alliance at its Phase 3. The Phase 3 was primarily to ensure that the national youth alliance get involved in intergovernmental processes in order to strategize and develop a plan to advocate for the post-2015 process. The project which is presently in Phase 4 focuses on tracking progress towards 2030, through youth led data driven social accountability measures to provide evidence based data for advocacy that will ensure youth engagement in the implementation of the SDGs.17
New Life Community Care Initiative (NELCCI) campaigns for implementation of SDGs in rural communities within the South-East Region of Nigeria.  As part of its SDGs implementation campaign, NELCCI collaborates with the State Agency for the Control of AIDS to run HIV status test in rural communities. Findings from NELCCIis test reports serve as one of the main information source for the Agency to plan for supplies of AntiRetroviral (ARV) drugs and other referral services. 
3.4.4 	Ensure Inclusive and Equitable Quality Education and Promote Lifelong Learning Opportunities for all (Goal 4)
The Overview
Nigeriais development and progress is heavily linked to access to quality inclusive and equitable universal education for all gender groups, including those with disability. A critical review of the table 3.4.4 (below) shows huge improvements in access to girl-child training while in some instances, such as the measure of youths and adults in formal and non-formal education and training in the last 12 months; 51% of females have access as compared to only 49% of the males.  The variance in percentage of children who are developmentally on track in health, learning and psycho-social well-being are comparatively insignificant between male and female. A programme such as the home-grown school feeding is very effective in enhancing school enrolment and incentivizing learning. 
The NERGP places emphasis on Vocational and Technical Education, Information and Communication Technology, technical engineering and scientific programmes with the objective of ensuring that youths and people living with disabilities acquire basic skills that will be useful and applicable in the job market.

Federal Policy and Programme Drivers Towards Achieving Goal 4 Targets
The Government of Nigeria collaborates with State and local governments and the private sector to establish and develop \0xEBbest-in-class modeli vocational and technical institutes. The target is to enrol approximately 500,000 students at the end of the Plan period in technical schools18. The Federal Ministry of Education has developed a Ministerial Master Plan (Education Strategic Plan) that targets the revival of new postsecondary school trade centers and technical schools. Part of the plan is to upgrade school infrastructure, provide teaching aids and equipment and also improve the school curriculum.
The Education Strategic Plan, titled, \0xECEducation for Change is aimed at improving the quality and access to education by incentivizing performance and building capabilities of teachers. Implementation of the strategies in this plan is expected to encourage schools to design and implement standard teacher coaching programs, comprising peer review through classroom visits, collaborative lesson planning and weekly sessions. The implementation of the provisions of this plan, is envisaged to be jointly carried out with relevant education stakeholders in order to ensure appropriate and adaptive setting of program objectives, tracking of progress and performance, as well as, facilitating effective intervention and integration of lessons learnt from the intervention. 
In addition to enhanced skills of teachers and the improvement of quality of education, implementation of the plan also aims at increasing the proportion of teachers that have the minimum teaching qualification (the National Certificate in Education (NCE). The graduating teachers will be issued with the NCE through the National Teachers Institute (NTI).  
Other key programs of the Federal Government are the huge investments in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education targeted at creating a critical mass of skills for sectors that will transform the national economy. This exercise needs to commence at the primary and secondary school level through the overhaul and review of the ICT curriculum which comprises computer science, information technology and digital literacy.  Partnerships will be cultivated with private organizations to organize innovative ICT competitions and subsidize professional qualifications for ICT graduates21. The Government also plans to embark on prioritization of girls and Almajiri education through the construction of special schools for girls in 13 pilot states that will include 501 classroom blocks. A total of 125 day and boarding Almajiri and nomadic education-based schools will be built in some northern states of Nigeria. These schools will be equipped with modern equipment and facilitating aids.
Under the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFUND): Plans are underway to use various funding frameworks to incentivize education performance and increase access to enrolment. TETFUND will be used to create incentives and encourage students in high performing institutions. New scholarship schemes will be established while the existing ones will be reviewed. There is need to encourage State and Local Governments and private sector organizations to provide scholarships and create endowment funds in trade centers, technical schools, universities and post-university skills development institutions.19 
Enhanced Digital Skills for Youths: OSSAP-SDGs worked with the Technology Giant Google, through its Digital Skills for Africa program, to train 125,000 youths across the country. The purpose of the training is to improve Digital Skills of young Nigerians, which are essential for jobs of the future. The training also aims at further equipping the beneficiaries with requisite knowledge and exposure towards gaining decent jobs, reducing income poverty and becoming key contributors to the Nigeriais economy. The OSSAP-SDGs plans to expand the scope of beneficiaries of this training to benefit more young Nigerians, as it will contribute to achieving SDG 1 on poverty reduction, SDGs indicator 4.4.1 on youths and adults with information and communication skills, SDGs indicator 8.5.2 on reducing unemployment rate, and SDG 17 on building partnerships for the SDGs implementation.
Sub-national Governmentis Policy Actions for SDG 4
Across various States, access to quality education at both primary and secondary school levels presents considerable challenge. The problem is even more acute and compounded for the girl-child in Northern Nigeria. The Universal Basic Education Commission UBEC has assisted States to articulate their strategic plans with focus on increased access for early childhood education and gender parity.  All States in Nigeria implement free and compulsory basic education to boost school enrolment and ensure retention of pupils in schools.20 Interventions such as the provision of more classrooms and furniture, recruitment of qualified teachers, training and retraining of existing teachers and provision of learning and teaching materials are carried out to boost school enrolment and retention of pupils in schools21 The Federal Government in partnership with the States are implementing the Home-Grown School Feeding Program (HGSFP) to increase enrolment and encourage children to stay in school. Incentives, which include subsidized school feeding programs, expanded classrooms, and recruitment of qualified teachers and provisions of teaching and learning aids are the strategies aimed at increasing access and enrolment. 
Many Statesi prioritise the creation of a friendly atmosphere at basic level that will attract parents to enrol their children in school. Consequently, children learn in a relaxed environment where they build confidence and bond together with their peers. The teaching methodology concentrates on tapping and discovering the childrenis creative talent where they are encouraged to express themselves. The trend and shift in vocational and technical education across States tends to concentrate on an educational curriculum that provides skills and training that will be relevant to the job market. This access also extends to tertiary and university education to increase the pool of skilled and qualified graduates who can produce and deliver for the economy. Vocational education development with emphasis on increasing female and male enrolment remains a top priority. 25 This also entails prioritization of ICT development and education for the girl child to acquire ICT skills. Skills in software development, hardware repairs, and computer aided graphic design are included in the school curriculum. In addition, hiring of science and technology teachers are prioritized to increase teacher: student ratio. ICT centers, laboratories, workshops and libraries have been built to provide the support to students in skills development. 
Elimination of gender disparities in education and access to education at all levels for the girl child features as part of the policy thrusts at the sub-national level. The priority is to achieve parity between male and female in access to quality education.22  At the same time, facilities for those with special needs are developed. Such facilities include computers, vocational education tools and equipment and better equipped libraries to improve accessibility to quality learning. Presently, attention is also shifting to schools in the rural communities to ensure equal opportunities for the poor and those at the bottom of the economic ladder. 
The tertiary education curriculum embraces gender studies, human rights and skills development that 

encourages sensitivity that promotes inclusiveness of those at the bottom of the economic pyramid. This includes more advocacies for human and women rights that will free significant portion of our population from economic bondage and slavery. Overall, the objective is to pursue elimination of poverty, hunger and disease including the empowerment of a greater percentage of the population in productive activities and value addition. 
The establishment of adult training centers was provided to improve access and quality of adult non-formal education. The aim was to create awareness and achieve some literacy levels; especially the ability to read and write. The implication is that skilled workers are produced at the sub-national level that will meet the requirements of the work force and employers and economic needs of the state. Overall, there is a conscious effort to achieve gender parity in the creation of opportunities for adult women.
The provision of adequate physical infrastructure at all levels of education for several categories of persons is integral to the development of education at sub-national levels. This entails functional libraries, sanitary facilities, computers, electricity and clean drinking water to provide conducive learning environment. The policy also embraces provision of infrastructure for persons with special needs.23 Students that attend schools in the rural communities and high-density areas in the urban areas will also have access to such infrastructures.
Scholarships for tertiary education are prioritized at sub-national levels especially for programs in sciences, engineering, environment, medicine and biotechnology.  Most States education policies provide for free and compulsory education including scholarship schemes focused on eradication of illiteracy.24 Government also embarked on payment of external examination fees for secondary school students to enhance access to higher education by the students. Most current development flow in the education sector are focused on rendering technical assistance for basic, primary and secondary education. 
All the governments at the sub-national level prioritize teacher training and improvement to raise the standards and quality of education. The priority is the recruitment of qualified and well-trained teachers and training and retraining of existing teachers.25 The objective is to improve teacher: student ratio and improve the performance of students and learning outcomes. Teachers with specialized skills are recruited to handle students with special needs. The Benue State Government has introduced the Mobile School on Wheels program for training of Youth in rural communities.
Civil Society Organizations Initiatives for SDG 4
Civil society organizations are collaborating with government at national and sub-national levels to improve access and job training for youths and girls. \0xEBMind the gapi has worked with Federal Ministry of Education to train about 2,500 youths in solar power and renewable energy. NELCCI works closely with Enugu State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) under its SDGs campaign program to monitor public basic education institutions in rural communities for quality of education, with focus on teaching aids and educational supplies that enhances good learning environment. Action Aid also embarked on provision of 129 blocks of 3 classrooms in the Federal Capital Territory. Other facilities provided includes 1,026 tables and chairs, 30 toilet facilities.
The Civil Society Action Coalition of Education for All (CSACCEFA) conducted capacity building workshop for 60 national education stakeholders on the SDGs-4.  Participants cut across the CSOs, youths and government officials across the MDAs in the education sector.  They also supported education of the Internally Displaced Children (IDPs).  This is targeting the enrolment of the 43,665 out of school children in 737 centers across the northern States (Adamawa, Bauchi, Borno, Gombe and Yobe States). 
E-Way for Development is presently running a scholarship project that is focused on providing quality education for women, girls and boys at the Local Government Education Authority (LEA) primary school, Kado-kuchi. The project includes scholarship for some girls and boys at the LEA primary school. It is also inclusive of an adult literacy centre, Womenis Literacy Programme, for women in Kado-kuchi LEA primary school. 
3.4.5 	Achieve Gender Equality and Empower all Women and Girls (Goal 5)
The Overview
Gender equality and womenis empowerment has been considered critical to economic development and the advancement of women in Nigeria. However, challenges abound as cases of physical, pyschological and sexual abuse against women still persist.  About 33.5% of women and girls 15 years and older, according to data provided by the Natioanl Bureau of Statistics in 2015, still confront cases of violence and emotional abuse. For instance, in 2015, 24.8% of girls and women aged 15 to 49 were reported to have undergone genital mutilation or cutting while 33.5% of ever-partnered women and girls aged 15 years and older were 

subjected to physical, sexual or psychological violence by either a current or former intimate partner.  Also, the statistics available showed that 34.9% of women and girls aged 15 years and older were subjected to sexual violence by persons other than an intimate partner in 2015.  The proportion of women aged 15-49 who make their own informed decisions regarding sexual relations, contraceptive use and reproductive health care was 24.8% in 2015 and the percentage of the women population that owned agriculture land was 71.1% in the same year.
The issue of early marriage among girls still posses challenge to education and decent jobs for women in the in some parts of the country.  The girl-child is exposed to VVF and HIV and AIDS through early marriage, which impedes her growth and development.  The percentage of girls and women who have undergone female genital mutilation/cutting remains as high as 39.9%.  Access to ownership and rights to agricultural land is improving.  On a positive note, women population who own mobile phones in the rural communities is on the increase. Overall, mainstreaming of gender in the NERGP remains top priority as part of inclusive policy formulation.

Federal Policy and Programme Drivers Towards Achieving Goal 5 Targets
In line with global best practices, Nigeria is strengthening her efforts at achieving gender equality as a fundamental step towards the achievement of SDG 5. To this end, a number of federal level initiatives and programmes can be enumerated, including the following:  
(i) Implementation of the Convention on Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW): In 2006, Nigeria approved the National Gender Policy, which is guided by the global instrument on the CEDAW and its optional Protocols. The overall national gender awareness and advocacy received added impetus with the institutionalization of gender mainstreaming in the country by the Federal Government. In a similar manner, mechanisms have been developed to assess the impact of the implementation of national policies and programmes on women, youth, children and vulnerable groups.
(ii) Massive Awareness Creation and Sensitization on gender equality: At the federal level, the Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development has created awareness and sensitization on the need to create opportunities and curb discrimination against women. This has resulted in mainstreaming of gender priorities in the NERGP which prioritizes programmes such as elimination of girl child genital mutilation, child trafficking and early marriage in the national policy document.
(iii) Gender and Equal opportunity Bill: The ongoing efforts towards enactment of the Gender Equality Bill in the National Assembly brings to the front burner the issue of elimination of all forms of discrimination against women. Federal lawmakers have realized the urgent need to empower women and the benefits of such policy initiatives in realizing the goals and aspirations of the NERGP.
(iv) Leadership Opportunities for Women: Gender advocacy groups across the country are canvassing for empowerment of women by reserving 35% of all elective offices and federal appointments for women. While this has gained traction among various stakeholders, a lot of work still needs to be done for this initiative to become law.
(v) Reactivation of Women Development Centres: Skills and artisan development is an integral component of gender empowerment and equality in Nigeria. As more women acquire skills and achieve economic empowerment, government has a greater opportunity to achieve gender parity. Women learn new skills in ICT, governance, health, education and MSMEs to economically empower themselves to compete for opportunities.
(vi) Existence of a National Gender Data Bank: The National Centre for Women Development (NCWD) has established an initiative of assembling gender disaggregated data to facilitate gender mainstreaming in evidence based planning and programming. In addition to this, the NBS has worked extensively in disaggregation of data by sex to enable policy makers to assess the progress made by women in all the critical sectors of our economy. The effective use of Management Information Systems has assisted extensively especially in sectors like health, education, water supply to critically evaluate the progress made by women.
(vii) The HE for SHE Programme on Gender Equality: This is aimed at breaking cultural barriers to gender equality. The programme identifies male Ambassadors to champion the curse of gender equality, while improving awareness on the programme.
(viii) Child Protection Initiatives: The Ministry of Women Affairs & Social Development has developed a National Strategic Plan 2016-2021 aimed at Ending Child Marriage in Nigeria whose highlights are the multi-sectoral and multi-faceted activities aimed at the objective of successfully ending child marriages in Nigeria. The Ministry has also established a child protection sub-working group, with mandate to coordinate Child Welfare Services, especially in the North-Eastern region of Nigeria. As part of the operations of this working group on child protection, a total of 92 cases-work investigations /interventions have been carried out between 2016 and 2017.
(ix) Promoting Rural Women Economic Empowerment: The Ministry has introduced measures to encourage rural women to form cooperatives in order to enable members to have access to microcredit for small business development and financial integration. The purpose here is to facilitate income generation that benefits individuals and households, contribute to the broader economic growth in their communities, and ultimately, achieve self-actualization. 
The other nrelated Women Empowerment Programmes being implemented by the Federal Government that will contribute to attainment of Goal 5 are the Business Development Fund for Women (BUDFOW) and the Women Fund for Economic Empowerment (WOFEE).
Sub-national Governments Policy Actions for SDG 5
At the sub-national level, many States have worked extensively to achieve gender parity and the inclusion of women and children in their policy frameworks. Lagos state strives to expand and improve comprehensive early childhood care and management of children. Ekiti, Taraba, Cross River, Borno and Zamfara States have all worked at mainstreaming gender equality and empowerment in their policies while Jigawa State is enforcing a policy that reduces early marriage among girls through compulsory completion of 6-year basic education and 3-year junior secondary education by every child. This policy also contributes to increased literacy and opportunities for decent jobs.
Programmes such as the CCT have targeted women in order to expand their capabilities of escaping poverty. Many of the programmes have built-in mechanisms for providing improved sources of livelihood while widows, old people and those living with disability are also included on special target groups.
The SDGs Conditional Grant Scheme also has focus on the establishment of women empowerment centers for vocational and small business acquisition skills and is expected to result in the empowerment of women, job creation and poverty alleviation.  Lagos State has created a programme for updating skills of trading women and artisans and is promoting loanable funds to SMEs and artisans. 
Civil Society Organizations Initiatives for SDG 5
In an effort to strengthen the educational and economic opportunities for the girl-child in Nigeria, Coca Cola Nigeria and the United Kingdom for International Development DFID partnered to launch the Educating Nigerian Girls in Nigerian Enterprise (ENGINE). The initiative benefited about 6,000 girls. As part of the ENGINE programme, a vocational training programme will be implemented in five local government areas of Lagos, namely Kosefe, Ojo, Bariga, Epe and Alimosho. About 6,357 girls will benefit from the programme which is aimed at empowering the educationally and economically disadvantaged children in the designated areas. The initiative will empower young females with training modules in four important areas to help them succeed. They will be taught business education, life skills, financial education and savings education.
NELCCI conducted a three-year (2014, 2015 and 2016) Budget analysis on Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC) in Enugu State, in partnership with the State Ministry for Gender Affairs and Social Development. The findings from the analysis led to approval by the State Executive Council for the Ministry to propose a supplementary budget on OVCs activities in the State. 
WEP is working on a project aimed at contributing towards attainment of gender equality in Nigeria by 2030. The project has the objectives to engage the State Legislators and the Executive members to come up with policies, programmes and legislations that will contribute to gender equality. This project is being implemented in Benue and Zamfara states of Nigeria with the funding support of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.
Women CSOs networking to realize the Sustainable Development Goals also known as Women 2030 is aimed at monitoring for effective implementation of the SDGs in 52 countries of the world with Nigeria as one of the countries. The project involves training of CSOs to understand the SDGs, and to be able to collect data and monitor implementation. The project also seeks to create opportunities for women CSOs to engage policy makers at sub-national, national and global levels and make inputs into SDGs plans and climate agreements. In addition, the project will engage the media to create awareness on the SDGs. Overall, the project intend to see that the needs of women are incorporated into the SDGs plans at all levels and the WEP has conducted National training in Nigeria on Gender and the SDGs and stepdown ongoing in 6 states.  
In the meantime, the Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD) held a high-level meeting on March 21, 2017 under the theme, \0xECthe Change Women Want in 2019 and Beyond, with the aim of increasing the number of women participating in political processes and ensuring gender equality in governance.  A total of 33 participants representing female politicians and activists, male champions, and gender-focused CSOs, assessed the challenges facing womenis entry into politics. On the basis of their findings, new sets of strategies aimed at improving womenis political engagement and participation were articulated in readiness for the 2019 general elections. Furthermore, a 14-point Action Plan was developed and is being advocated with the aim of contributing to SDG-5.  At the same time, \0xEBE-Way for Developmenti provided 40 women in some rural area/s with micro grants to enable them commence mini trading business and thus empower them economically. The project also includes encouraging a culture of savings and financial integration for the beneficiaries.
\0xEBGender Advocacy for Justice Initiativei (GAJI) has also successfully advocated for, and facilitated reservation of elective positions for women in Local Government Council elections in Benue State. This resulted in 30% of women occupying chair-person positions in the Benue State Local Government Councils.
3.4.6 	Building Resilient Infrastructure, Promoting Sustainable Industrialization and Fostering Innovation (Goal 9)
The Overview 
Nigeria government has prioritized infrastructure development in its development agenda and this has started yielding significant results. In the period under review, the infrastructure sectoris contribution to the GDP has been put at 35% while Nigeriais Electric Power Sector which was privatized in 2005 had about 12.5GW installed capacity as at November 2016 with about 15 per cent of installed capacity distributed to end users. In terms of industrialization, Nigeria has so far established 34 free zones aimed at promoting the industrial and economic growth of the nation.  
Federal Government Policy and Programme Drivers Towards Achieving Goal 9 Targets
As part of advancement on bridging the infrastructural deficit in development, Nigeria enacted a law in 2005, to establish an Infrastructure Concession and Regulatory Commission (ICRC). The Commission which was inaugurated in 2008, has as its primary mandate, the regulation of the operational interface between the Government and the Private sector, through a PPP arrangement. The PPP is ultimately aimed at creating an enabling environment for private sector participation and investment in infrastructure development of the nation. 
To ensure enforcement of policy commitments, the Federal Government has prioritized infrastructure development in her 2016 and 2017 Appropriation law. For instance, infrastructure development constituted 41% of the total capital allocation in the 2016 budget. The Honourable Minister for Budget and National Planning, declared the 2017 budget to be the budget of infrastructure development, during his public presentation of the 2017 budget. Thus, the implementation of the capital budget that relates to Power, Agriculture, Health, Education, Skills Acquisition Centres and Water Infrastructure will directly contribute to the achievement of SDGs-1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 9.
Another important pivot in the 2016 budget that has strong potential for contributing to SDGs implementation was the inclusion of the private sector to share in the cost and risks of the envisaged infrastructural projects. The budget also provided for the much needed technical and managerial capacity to bridge the massive infrastructure deficit through structured Public Private Partnerships (PPPs).

In more specific terms, an analysis of the developments in the infrastructure sector and how they contribute to the SDGs is presented herebelow:
? For Goals 6 and 7: The National Integrated Power Project (NIPP) is an integral part of Federal Governmentis efforts to combat the power shortages in the country and enhance industrialization. It was conceived in 2004 as a fast-track public sector funded initiative to add significant new generation capacity to Nigeriais electricity supply system along with the electricity transmission and distribution and natural gas supply infrastructure required to deliver the additional capacity to consumers throughout the country. 
? For Goals 1 and 2: The NERGP provided for irrigation infrastructure development to enhance agricultural productivity while the Nigeria Industrial Revolution Plan (NIRP) was launched in 2014 to transform the country from commodity export nation into an industrial economy. It was articulated to address development of industries in areas where Nigeria has comparative advantage such as agri-business and agro-allied; solid minerals and metals; oil and gas related industries; and construction, light manufacturing and services. Also, emphasis is placed on developing telecommunication and ICT infrastructure. 
? For Goal 9: A National Integrated Infrastructure Master Plan (NIIMP) which is a 30-year plan covering the core and non-core infrastructure has been launched. The non-core infrastructure is more related to the SDGs.  A delivery unit to ensure effective implementation of the plan is in place. About 15 of the SDGs goals are being addressed by the plan. A significant landmark to the implementation of NIIMP is that the 2017 budget is drawing from the plan.
? For Goals 1, 6, 7, 9 and 17: The Nigerian Export Processing Zones Authority (NEPZA) is a Federal Government Agency under the supervision of the Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade & Investment. The NEPZA was established in 1992 following the enactment of the Nigeria Export Processing Zones Act 63, of 1992. The Agency is responsible for promoting and facilitating local and international investments into licensed Trade Free Zones (TFZ). The TFZ scheme was introduced to strategically improve the investment climate for enhanced industrialization and trade. This is being implemented by stimulating export oriented business activities such as strengthening strategic national economic policies, streamlining administrative approval processes and providing a one-stop-shop service for businesses within and outside Nigeria. A total of 34 TFZ have been established across the country. Some of the zones cater for a specific area of economic enterprise while others are more general in nature. There are currently over 300 licensed TFZ enterprises operating across the country. The overall purpose of introducing the TFZ initiative in the country is to create an enabling environment aimed at enhancing 

economic growth and development of export oriented manufacturing in the non-oil sector of the economy. It is also aimed at enforcing the Nigerian local content policy in the oil & gas sector in order to diversify the countryis economic base, attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), generate employment, increase foreign exchange earnings, enhance technology transfer, skill acquisition/upgrading as well as create backward linkages. All these expected benefits have direct contribution to SDGs 1, 4, 7 and 17.
Furthermore, among the priority projects in 2016 budget included investment in critical infrastructure, particularly in Power, Roads, Rail, and Housing and creating an enabling environment for growth and innovation in the private sector. The related commitments in the 2016 budget included the following:
1. Implementation of measures to achieve self-sufficiency & become net exporters of certain agricultural items: Rice-2018, tomato paste- 2016, and wheat-2019. Increase local production of maize, soya, poultry  and  livestock, so as to achieve self-sufficiency;
2. Revitalization and expansion of agro-allied processing to intensify local production and processing of cassava, cocoa, cashew, fruits and sesame seed; 
3. Adoption and implementation of a roadmap to stimulate investments into the solid minerals sector and plug revenue leakages in the sector; 
4. Implementation of the National Industrial Revolution Plan and launch the \0xEBMade in Nigeriai campaign; and
5. Increase in the manufacturing capacity by operationalizing Industrial Parks, Free and Export Processing Zones.
The Federal Government also conducted a critical assessment of the power sector value chain that was experiencing funding challenges. Thereafter, the CBN and other Development Finance Institutions provided support that has enabled Nigeria to successfully resolve issues of liquidity that was challenging development in the power sector.  
And as part of the efforts of the Federal Government to address the infrastructure needs and ensure industrial revolution, a National Science and Technology Roadmap under the Ministry of Science and Technology has been prepared and a programme called 774 aimed at promoting science oriented policy across the 774 Local Governments Areas (LGA) instituted. On this basis, every year young science and technology-oriented individuals are selected from each LGA for promotion. 
Sub-National Level Government Polices for Goal 9
At the sub-national level, various efforts are being made to address their infrastructure needs and mainstream infrastructure into state level development plans and strategies. For instance, the Ondo State government is aligning itself with the federal government infrastructure master plan by ensuring that their counterpart funds are made available and the state planning and budgeting board is mainstreaming SDGs into their planning and budgeting for the state. The Lagos State government has, for its part, been investing heavily on infrastructure through the introduction of better transportation modes (BRT lanes, improvement of road infrastructure such as more bus shelters and the installation of more traffic signal lights to ease traffic flow). They are also providing solar energy solutions to Primary Health Centres (PHCs) and schools as well as through climate action (the distribution of gas cylinders to replace traditional fuel like firewood and kerosene). In addition:
	? 	All the states are promoting the use of solar powered water boreholes projects;
? Nassarawa State is constructing feeder roads, culverts in communities and implementing rural electrification for communities;
	? 	Zamfara State is focusing on construction and rehabilitation of earth dams; and
? Benue State government has been mainstreaming the SDGs into its planning and budgeting for 2017 with special focus on infrastructural development. The State has also aligned its 2017 budget with the National Infrastructure Master Plan by ensuring the provision of counterpart funds in the budget and by constructing feeder roads; culverts in communities and implementing rural electrification in rural communities. 
Civil Society Organizations Actions and Initiatives for SDG 9
Local and International CSOs are supporting the Government of Nigeria at the federal, state and local levels in a diversity of ways. Action Aid Nigeria (AAN) is piloting a new initiative \0xEBDigitalizingi for inclusive development building and equipping young men and women in digital entrepreneurship. The WEP in partnership with the NBS has trained over 200 youngsters on open data and collection of data on the state of infrastructure and budget administration in the country and is also mobilizing them towards improving the living conditions of people in slum areas through data collection as a tool for advocacy.
3.4.7  Conservation and Sustainable use of the Oceans, Seas and Marine Resources for Sustainable Development (Goal 14) 
The Overview
This goal focuses on the sustainable management and protection of marine and coastal ecosystems. It covers conservation and protection of ocean and aquatic life. This goal is significant to Nigeria because the Nigerian coastline is about 853km and about 1% of the total land area is made of water (Nigeriais total land area is 923,768 square kilometres which comprises land of 910,768 square km and water 13,000 square km). Marine activities constitute a significant revenue source for the country and efforts have been placed over time in developing and managing the sector to ensure continuous benefits to the country. 
Federal Government Policy and Programme Drivers Towards Achieving Goal 14 Targets
Nigeria has been focusing on addressing environmental issues through the Ministry of Environment as well as the issues of marine and coastal ecosystem through the establishment of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA). NIMASA was created to ensure enthronement of global best practices in the provision of maritime services in Nigeria. Some of the core focus of the agency include effective Maritime Safety Administration, Marine Pollution Prevention and Control, Cybotage enforcement, Maritime Capacity Development using modern tools that guarantee efficiency and effectiveness, etc. Through the NERGP, the Government is committed to implementing environmental programmes that are geared towards sustainable environment which covers the ocean and marine. These commitments include to implement projects under the Great Green Wall initiative to address land degradation and desertification, implement environmental initiatives in the Niger Delta region (e.g., continue the Ogoni Land clean-up and reduce gas flaring) as well as raise a Green Bond to finance environmental projects-among others.
Sub-National Governments Policy Initiatives for Goal 14
Few States within the ocean and sea boundaries are constructively aligning with the federal government in conserving and protecting ocean and marine resources through their various programmes. For example, Cross 
Rivers and Lagos states are crafting policies, strategies and programmes aimed at addressing climate change. 

3.4.8  	Promotion of Peaceful and Inclusive Societies for Sustainable Development (Goal 16) 
The targets and indicators for this goal address the issues of access to justice, crime and crises, violence including those of domestic nature; trafficking, corruption and illegitimate possession of public goods and services that negates the principles of peaceful coexistence between and across the citizenry. Some of the critical targets of this goal are the reduction in all forms of violence and related death rates; promotion of rule of law at national levels; access to justice; reduction in corruption; access to information and protection of fundamental human right, etc. The Federal Ministry of Justice is anchoring the administration of justice with various CSOs and donor partners providing critical support.  The Government has also been battling the challenge posed by the Boko Haram Insurgency in the Northeast; the Militancy in the Niger Delta; the Fulani Herdsmen and famersi crisis, as well as the kidnapping of persons for money and perceptions of corruption by public servants. 
Nigeriais Government has existing structures and organizations that are charged with the responsibility of handling issues related to the targets of this goal. The 2016 budget identified improved security and reduced corruption as among the priority areas for attention. Therefore, in 2016 there was continuous funding of the Amnesty Office to create peace in the oil rich Niger Delta, the funding of Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) Camps for immediate accommodation of persons displaced by insurgency and other related groups. The Nigeria Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) was established to provide immediate and urgent attention to person displaced by natural and man-made disasters.

Federal Policy and Programme Drivers Towards Achieving Goal 16 Targets 
The NERGP has articulated some salient intervention policies and strategies aimed at addressing the issues related to this goal; including specifically the following:
1. Develop and implement a comprehensive action plan for the North East, including emergency humanitarian assistance, relocation, rehabilitation, and resettlement, and building peace, security, infrastructure, agriculture, health, education, and governance.
2. Develop and implement a sustainable action plan to stabilize and develop the Niger Delta. 

3. Sustain and re-invigorate the Amnesty Plan.  
4. Ensure environmental sustainability within the Niger Delta  Region.  
5. Strengthen the capacity of the Nigeria Police Force, the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Nigeria Prisons Service, Federal Fire Service and the Nigeria Immigration Service e.g., by establishing a national criminal records registry.
6. Develop and strengthen the capacity of the Armed Forces of Nigeria and the Military Industrial Complex to ensure strategic deterrence and defence, exercise forward presence in vital areas, responding effectively to crisis and retaining the national capacity to reconstitute forces.
7. Establish at least one Brigade in every State capital in Nigeria to fulfil the fundamental demands of the National Security Strategy.
8. Promote the adoption of community policing strategies.  
9. Equip and provide the manpower required for military and  paramilitary services.
10. Establish enduring partnerships with security agencies in allied countries to build local capacity and curb cross border crimes such as terrorism, cyber-crimes and others.   
At the same time, the anti-corruption policies and strategies of the government under President Buhari have been yielding positive results and public officers are becoming more accountable.  Monies are being recovered from corrupt public servants; peace is gradually returning to the Niger Delta with vandalization and destruction of oil facilities having significantly reduced and hence increasing the daily oil production. Similarly, insurgency has been almost eliminated. 
Civil Society Organizations Policy Actions for SDG 16
The African Foundation for Environment and Development (AFED) under its programme titled \0xEBEmpowering citizens to engage in governance, is creating tripartite partnership arrangement between the civil society, Legislature and the Media in order to engage the Executive and the Judiciary.  A mobile and online progress tracking platform is being put in place with funding from the European Commission.
3.4.9  	Revitalize Global Partnership for Sustainable Development (Goal 17)
The Government of Nigeria has been seeking collaboration and partnerships with local and international organizations, development partners as well as with CSOs and the private sector in its developmental pursuit. The Ministry of Budget and National Planning has a department of International Corporation that is in charge of donor coordination and programme planning. Bureau of Public Enterprise is in charge of coordinating public private sector initiatives while Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment is responsible for investment and export promotion, business etc. Within the Ministry are the following two agencies/ parastatals n Export Promotion Council and Investment Promotion Commission.  As part of the global initiative, Nigeria belongs to the Open Government Partnership (OGP). Also, Nigeria is a member of ECOWAS, African Union (AU), etc.

Federal Policy and Programme Drivers Towards Achieving Goal 17 Targets 
In the Open Government Partnership (OGP) Nigeria made commitment in 14 areas which are categorized into four thematic areas as follows:
1. Promoting fiscal transparency; 
2. Access to information; 
3. Anti-corruption and asset disclosure; and 
4. Citizen Engagement and Empowerment. 
The National Action Plan articulated strategies to promote fiscal transparency through more citizen participation in the budget-making process, implementation of open contracting in the public sector, enhancing disclosure in the extractive industries, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the tax system and improving the ease of doing business in Nigeria. Also, the action plan has strategies crafted to ensure that corruption is rooted out through the establishment of a public beneficial ownership register, the development of a platform for sharing information between government MDAs to detect and prevent corrupt practices, the strengthening of asset recovery legislation and taking appropriate actions to coordinate anti-corruption activities. Under the citizenis engagement thematic area, the NAP will lead to the development of a permanent dialogue mechanism between citizens and government; review of legislation around transparency and accountability issues; and the adoption of a technology-based citizensi feedback on projects and programmes aimed at improving access to information by increasing compliance with the Freedom of Information Act.
The 2016 budget provided opportunity for collaboration and partnership through the following strategies: ? Private Sector Investments: Implementing a roadmap to increase Private Sector Investment in Tourism, Entertainment & Sports; 
? Technology and Innovation: Creating high-technology innovation hubs to support growth in the Digital & Technology sub-sector;
? Inauguration of partnership Groups on SDGs: Various partnership groups have been created by the OSSAP-SDGs; including a Private Sector Advisory Group (PSAG), the CSO Group, and the Donors Forum on SDGs. All are geared towards building effective partnerships for the implementation of SDGs;
? Establishment of the IDPs Forum on SDGs: As part of the strategies to ensure inclusiveness in the implementation of the SDGs, Internally Displaced Persons Forum has been created. It is meant to generate information on the IDPs as well as create viable opportunity for responding to their needs; and
? Inter-Agency Partnerships for SDGs Implementation and Coordination: To ensure effective implementation of SDGs, budgetary allocation has been made for the SDGs office in the 2017 budget and each MDA is mainstreaming SDGs into their programmes and activities. 
Sub-National Government Policies for SDG 17
In tandem with Federal Government policies, the creation of the SDGs Offices in the States and Local Governments following the success stories recorded from the MDGs implementation, the SDGs implementation framework adopted the structure instituted during the MDGs. The structure in place includes the Office of the Senior Special Assistant to the President (OSSAP-SDGs) who is the coordinator of the SDGs in Nigeria but reporting directly to the President. 
Civil Society Organization Policies for SDG 17
The CSOs in Nigeria have also found it necessary to collaborate and partner with the different segments of government and society thereby necessitating the formation of the CSO advisory groups on SDGs, who are now mobilizing and engaging at different levels.  NELCCI is also coordinating some CSOs on SDGs in the South-Eastern region of Nigeria to deepen advocacy, campaign and intervention activities for enhanced SDGs implementation in the region. The group aims to strengthen collaboration with appropriate state government institutions on, including the State SDGs units while doing so. 
3.4.10  Thematic Analysis of Nigeriais Implementation of the SDGs
This section attempts a brisk thematic summary and analysis of what Nigeria is doing in relation to the thematic focus of the High Level Political Forum for Year 2017, which is billed as, \0xECEradication of Poverty and Promoting Prosperity in a Changing World.  The SRQ guiding this analysis is thus:
SRQ-1.5:  Is there any national initiative of special attention that aligns with the thematic focus of the high level political forum for 2017?
Implementing the Social Investment Programme
Nigeria is implementing a Social Investment Programme (SIP) based on the countryis recognition of the high rate of poverty with increasing inequality, deprivation and rising unemployment amidst economic recession all which challenge the overall well-being of the people (SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 8). Such deprivation and inequality exacerbate the humanitarian crisis being experienced in the country. Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) shows that the incidence of poverty in the country is at 62.32 percent, which implies that with an estimated population of 190 million people, approximately more than 100 million, people live below the poverty line. 
At the federal level, the government is implementing a National Social Investment Project (SIP), which is directly linked to poverty eradication and promoting prosperity in a changing world. The SIP is aimed at reducing poverty; fight against hunger and poor Human Development Indices (HDI). The programmes under the project include Social Safety Nets for feeding the poor, welfare for unemployed, job creation and skills enhancement targeting about 3 million jobs. The SIP is coordinated from the National Social Investment Office within the Office of the Vice President. To ensure credible targeting of the poor and vulnerable, a National Social Register has been opened. As part of social inclusion, the federal and state governments are emphasizing inclusive education and health services in their programmes.

BOX 3.2:   NATIONAL SOCIAL REGISTER
The Federal Government had established a \0xECNational Social Registerii for poor and vulnerable Nigerians to ensure effective implementation of poverty alleviation programs.  A National Program Coordinator has been appointed. The Register is established through the National Social Safety Net Coordinating Office (NASSCO), under the Office of the Vice President. NASSCO has already established the Social Register in more than 10 states of the federation. 




The programme has four main areas of intervention as detailed below. 
The intervention programmes designed and implemented at the national level include the following:
(1) 	Conditional Cash Transfer Programme 
This programme is aimed at providing transfers to some 765,760 poor people and vulnerable households with the final aim of graduating them out of poverty. The target is that 30% of the poor and vulnerable households will be graduating from the lowest poverty quintile in the first year, 50% in the second year and 20% in the third Year, giving a total of 100%. The objectives and outcome targets of this program aligns very well with SDGs 1 and 2 on \0xEBNo Poverty and Zero Hungeri, which are components of eradicating poverty and promoting prosperity.
(2) 	Home Grown School Feeding Programme
This is targeted at primary 1-3 pupils in public primary schools and is aimed at increasing enrolment and completion rate at the early primary school level (primary 1 to 3). It will also create jobs via recruitment of vendors who supply home grown and locally made food to the schools. As Nigeria has identified malnutrition as one of the major causes of infant and maternal death, the nutritional component of this programme contributes to improved nutrition on each benefiting pupil. This programme directly contributes to SDGs 3 on healthy lives and well-being through the nutrition improvement, and SDG 8 on decent jobs for food vendors and increased in primary school enrolment, and they all align with the theme of eradicating poverty and promoting prosperity.
(3) 	Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme (GEEP)
This programme is aimed at providing access to financial services to traders, market women and women cooperatives, artisans and Medium, Small and Micro Enterprises (MSMEs); enterprising clusters/youth, farmers and agricultural workers. In addition to contributing to financial inclusion which contributes to SDG 8, with specific emphasis on target 8.3 that aims to promote development-oriented policies that support activities, decent job creation, entrepreneurship, creative and innovation, and encourage the formalization and growth of micro-small, and medium sized enterprises, including through access to financial services. It also contributes to SDG target 8.5 that aims to achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including for young people and persons with disabilities, and equal pay for work on values by 2030. It is also along with SDG 5 on gender equality through its \0xECmarkemoni activities, which in all, align with the theme of eradicating poverty and promoting prosperity.
(4) 	N- Power Programme 
This programme is designed to help young Nigerians acquire and develop life-long skills to become solution providers in their communities and players in the domestic and global market. It is created for graduate skilled, unskilled, and out-of-school youths between 18-35 to last for 2 years. This programme contributes to achieving SDG target 8.6, which aims to substantially reduce the proportion of youth not employed, educated, or trained by 2030. Provision of skills and decent jobs for youth aligns with the theme of eradicating poverty and promoting prosperity. 
Overall, these four programmes have acquired a high level political and executive buy-in and full commitment from the President and the Vice President. A brief highlight of what the country has achieved from the implementation of these programmes includes, but are not limited, to the following:
1. Establishment of State and National Database with the support of the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC);
2. A Policy Framework for all programmes under the Social Investment Programme has been established within the NERGP;
3. Development of the National Social Register domiciled with the MBNP;
4. Modules and operational manuals produced to guide the implementation of the N-power programme;
5. Creation of a portal for unemployed youths: 93% of data verified with a Bank Verification Number (BVN);
6. Value chain for women and farmers since cooks for the Home-Grown School Feeding; programmes are selected from the communities: State Ministry of Health sits with the technical team to draw the menu and cooks are paid every 20 days through their BVN;
7. 40% of each application in every State selected across gender and including people with disability;
8. N30,000 stipends paid to graduates to serve under the N-power programme;
9. Payment through mobile banking to reach those in remote areas; and
10. Establishment of an audit trail for all programmes.
In summary, all the components of this special initiative by President Muhammadu Buhariis Social Investment Programme, will contribute to specific targets within SDGs 1; 2; 3; 4;5 and 8 and all relating to the thematic focus of the high level political forum for year 2017. 
BOX 3.3:   CONDITIONAL GRANTS SCHEME (CGS)
The MDGs/SDGs Conditional Grants Scheme (CGS) was introduced in 2007 as a vehicle for fostering Intergovernmental collaboration towards scaling up efforts for achieving the MDGs. It aims to support States and Local Governments in the implementation of projects supporting the achievement of the MDGs at the local level. It is a programme in which State and Local Governments are availed the opportunity to access funds annually from the Federal Governmentis share of the Debt Relief Gains. Accessing these funds is contingent upon meeting set criteria in the guidelines governing the scheme.
The CGS is a world-acclaimed innovative best practice that has accelerated progress towards the attainment of the MDGs in Nigeria and now carried forward in the implementation of SDGs to achieve more results with a clearly articulated and focused programme of action. The following are the specific objectives of the CGS: 
\0xEF Investing in the SDGs at the sub-national level and ensuring local ownership and sustainability;
\0xEF Empowering State and Local Governments to carry out their constitutional responsibilities;
\0xEF Leveraging improvements in public service delivery
\0xEF Encouraging improvements in public expenditure reform
\0xEF Strengthening the partnership between the three tiers of government for national planning
The CGS process has two tracks n the CGS to States and the CGS to Local Governments. Key interventions under the Conditional Grants Scheme included Education, Health, Water and Sanitation. However, with the transition from the MDGs to the SDGs the goals are much more in number with a wider range of issues than were the case under the MDGs, hence work is ongoing to agree on the specific goals to pursue relative to country development needs through the CGS mechanism
3.5  	Institutional Mechanisms for Coordinating Implementation of SDGs
The legal, institutional and coordinating mechanisms that Nigeria has put in place for the SDGs is elaborated based on this SRQ:
SRQ-1.6:  How appropriate is the institutional mechanism set by the government to facilitate horizontal and vertical coordination of SDGs implementation?
3.5.1  The SDGs Legal Framework
The legal operating environment in Nigeria considers bills passed by the parliament as proposed developmental areas for consideration by the executive arm of government. The bill becomes an act (federal level) or a law (State level) when signed by the President or State Governor, respectively. In the same vein the global declaration on SDGs represent globally accepted but proposed developmental areas for consideration and possible integration into national development planning and strategic frameworks, by participating countries. Having signed unto the UN Declaration on the SDGs declaration by President Muhammadu Buhari, on September 25, 2015, the country did not consider it needful for ratification before appropriate integration in to her policy and planning framework.  
In addition to this, the appointment letter of the SSAP-SDGs contains clear mandates and focus, on driving efficient and effective implementation of the SDGs across the country. This includes advocating for, and facilitating integration, coordinating implementation, managing process and performance with timely and accurate accounting on SDGs performance and results. The office leverages on existing legal instrument where necessary. For instance, the Country has a legal framework that demands parliamentarians to support development projects that address need-based and demand-driven requests by their local constituency. OSSAP-SDGs leverages on this law to support SDGs constituency projects. Similarly, while respecting the principles of autonomous government between the federal and State government, the OSSAP-SDGs adopts the conditional grants scheme as a mechanism to demand for resource allocation by the State governments, to pre-select SDGs initiatives. All these provide, inter-alia, supportive legal and regulatory environment for SDGs implementation in Nigeria. 
3.5.2  A Multi-Layer Coordinating Mechanism 
OSSAP-SDGs as a Coordinating Institution: The office of the Senior Special Assistant to the President on the SDGs OSSAP-SDGs coordinates the activities of the SDGs at national and sub-national level (States and Local Government). The core mandate of the office is to mobilize the support and the political will for key stakeholders for the realization of the SDGs. However, the selection of the relevant institutions, mandates and actions that will ensure that coordination, implementation and monitoring of SDGS and manage programmes for results is critical to progress.2 
The OSSAP-SDGs has recorded several successes since its establishment; including conducting an institutional review and skills capacity assessment; training and retraining of key staff and securing of funding for technical posts. As part of the need for effective communication the SDGs communication and MDAsi press units were strengthened. The branding of the SDGs was achieved with new SDGs logo localized for Nigeria. A robust SDG website has been developed with all the full components of Social Media such as Facebook, twitter and other social media Apps. A mapping of the Private Sector through partnership with the Nigeriais Economic Summit Group NESG has been achieved to inaugurate the Private Sector Working Group to PSWG, aimed at increasing Private Sector financing for the SDGs. Strong partnerships with the NASS appropriation committee has been established and is critical in ensuring that all relevant legislation for the full realization of the SDGs receive adequate attention in the appropriation law. 
The Presidential Committee on SDGs is pivotal in ensuring that key mandates and relationships relevant to SDGs are properly coordinated. The OSSAP-SDG has been able to strengthen relationships with Ministry of Budget and National Planning to ensure that programmes are domesticated in the Strategy Implementation Plan and the ERGP and that financing is provided through the federal government budget mechanism. 
The OSSAP-SDGs has also improved the level of intergovernmental relationships across the three tiers of government and has been able to establish a partnership framework through an inter-agency compact, Development Partneris Coordination Framework; a Citizenis Public Service Feedback Mechanism; a Community Consultative Partnership as well as a Private Sector partnership. The overall objective in all these is to bring all stakeholders together to properly coordinate and synchronize all efforts towards the implementation and realization of the SDG goals. 
To properly track project and programme performance, the OSSAP-SDGs realigned the National Statistical System with the SDGs by collaborating with partners to carry out a baseline data survey for the SDG indicators. Priority was given to administrative data through support to MBNP, FMOH, NPHCDA, UBEC to improve routine data collection. Monitoring and evaluation platform was integrated into the OPEN M&E experience working with the MBNP. 
SDG-MDA Focal Persons: The role of the SDG sector focal persons is critical in mainstreaming SDG goals and targets into departmental programmes. The essence is to ensure that programmes are domesticated through the ERGP and funding provided to implement the programme through the instrumentality of the budget mechanism. SDG sector focal persons will also be tracking the release of funds and the implementation of SDG programmes and projects. 
SDG State Focal Persons: Across the 36 states, the State Governments have appointed or designated SDG Focal Persons for their respective States. Core mandate of these State focal persons include coordination of implementation of the SDGs and targets in line with the directives issued by the OSSAP-SDG. 
SDG-LGA Focal Persons: Certain states in the federation has worked to maintain some degree of Local Government autonomy and as such the Local Government Chairmen are appointed as Local Government focal persons. Their mandate is to coordinate the implementation of certain goals that are critical at the local government level especially goals 1, 2, 3, 4 and 8 for social services (Health, Education), economic growth drivers to reduce poverty and achieve social inclusion. SDG Local Government Focal persons take directive from the State SDG focal persons while Heads of key SDG relevant sectors at the Local Government works closely with State MDAs to coordinate and implement the programmes. 
SDGs Desk in NBS: The Statistician General of the NBS manages data collection and dissemination to OSSAP-SDG and the line MDAs. The OSSAP-SDG has been able to work with NBS to review and realign National Statistical system to suit the requirements and data needs of the SDGs. To this end, NBS collaborated with relevant MDAs and donors to carry out a baseline data survey for certain SDG indicators. 
State SDG Desks and State Bureau of Statistics: Most State Bureau of Statistics are headed by a Director General who coordinates data collection in collaboration with relevant MDAs. Efforts are made by the State Office of Statistics to provide relevant data that will from the baseline for the measurement of the targets and indicators to ensure that SDG goals are properly tracked.  Most States have worked with development partners to update data in critical sectors of social services and economic growth drivers. 
Internal National Performance Review and Evaluation on SDGs: The OSSAP-SDGs developed guidelines for internal national performance review of the 2030 agenda. The guideline is expected to provide direction on availability of baseline data by the NBS for measurement of the targets and indicators relevant to each goal. Data availability and gathering requires a lot of resources.  NBS worked with the MBNP and the relevant donor agencies to outline sources of data production for the 2030 agenda, with strategy options for data collation and dissemination. 
The OSSAP-SDG office is working with State and Local Government on a comprehensive time table for the review of the SDGs. This will involve resource planning with the MBNP to ensure a successful exercise and meeting of targets. The M&E Department of the MBNP is working on ensuring that all the National SDG targets are provided for in the national M&E template with relevant Key Performance Indicators( KPIs) for measurement and tracking of each SDG indicators and targets. 
OSSAP-SDGS and the National Assembly: The National Assembly (NASS) comprising the Senate and the House of Representatives, has appointed their Committees on SDGs. The Senate Committee on SDGs is made up of 12 members with a Chairman, a Vice Chairman and a Committee Clerk/ Head of Secretariat. The Committeeis roles and responsibilities include:
? Provision of coordinating oversight on the activities of Sustainable Development Office in Nigeria, including the Office of the Senior Special Assistant to the President on SDGs. 
? Liaison with International Donors and Private Sector Partners with the objective of facilitating achievement of the SDGs.
	? 	Supervision of the implementation of SDGs projects and programmes in Nigeria.
	? 	Annual SDGsi Budget Estimate.
	? 	Any other matter relating to SDGs.
The House of Representativesi Committee on SDGs, on the other hand, is made up of 38 members with a Chairman, a Deputy Chairman and a Committee Clerk/ Head of Secretariat. Members are drawn from each of Nigeriais six geopolitical zones. The Committeeis roles and responsibilities include:
	? 	Coordination of budget proposals in respect to SDGs in the House of Assembly.
	? 	Harmonization of the SDGsi budget with other Committees of the House and that of the Senate.
	? 	Oversight of the broad implementation of SDGs and the Agencies responsible for its implementation.
	? 	Creation of opportunities to interact with stakeholders for the attainment of SDGs. 
	? 	Annual SDGsi budget estimates.

3.5.3  Partnerships and Collaboration  
The National Strategy provides for an institutional framework and organizational arrangement for the engagement of Private Sector and Foundations. The framework is designed to give expression to the Private Sector Advisory Group (PSAG) as envisaged by the Country Transition Strategy (CTS). The Private Sector Advisory Group Model is proposed therein, as a Strategic Framework for Partnership with the Public Sector and as a vehicle for engaging the Private Sector and Foundations in the implementation of Agenda 2030. 
It leverages on the potential of these stakeholders in co-creating the required impacts that are enshrined in the countryis commitment to the SDGs.  Nigeria developed the CTS and an Action Plan to operationalize it in partnership with the UNDP and DFID.26 A key deliverable of the National Strategy and Action Plan in the implementation of the Agenda 2030, is to support the CTS through an Institutional Framework that links OSSAP-SDGs and the Private Sector Taskforce/ Advisory Groupis role in ensuring the effective mobilization, participation and engagement of the Private Sector in the SDGs Agenda. 
Private Sector Group on SDGs: As presented in the strategy document, the OSSAP-SDGs has since inaugurated the Private Sector Advisory Group on SDGs (PSAG) which has commenced work targeted at scaling-up of SDGs implementation in Nigeria. 
The group has three main strategic objectives that supports the implementation of SDGs in Nigeria. These objectives are: 
(i) To establish, in the short-term (2016-2020), a foundation for Private Sector and Foundations for the core Development Agenda and mobilize private sector members around the SDGs targets and the Global Compacts for business;
(ii) To leverage, in the medium-term (2021-2025),  the momentum of the vast resources of the private sector and stakeholder commitment to scale up sustainable development impacts; and
(iii) To deliver, in the long-term (2026-2030) the Global Goals Promise. 
In terms of structure, the PSAG consists of the following: 
1. 	Two Co-Chairmen (one from the Private Sector Organizations and the other from a Foundation) 2. 	Lead, SDGs Public-Private Dialogue;
3. Lead, SDGs Research, Development and Capacity Building; 
4. Lead, SDGs Collaborations, Partnerships and Strategic Alliances; 5. 	Lead, SDGs Interventions and Impact Investments; and
	6. 	Lead, SDGs PSAG Platform Management.
For proper alignment of programmes with government sectoral programmes, PSAG will work closely with Government Technical Working Groups (TWGs) that have been structured around related NERGP policies and programmes, such as Agriculture, Agro-Allied and Food Security; Real Sector, Land and Energy development programmes; Human Capital development; Environmental Sustainability; Infrastructure development; Institutional development; MSMEs; Finance and financial markets; Innovations, Science and Technology; Trade, Investment and Competitiveness, among others. 
Each TWG will incorporate members of the Private Sector and Foundations, focused on specific SDGsrelated programmes and targets. 
Overall, the PSAG will:
1. Work with the Office of the SSAP to hold periodic Public-Private Sector Dialogues      that will expand the engagement across the Private Sector and Foundations on SDGs;
2. Promote and coordinate broad-based actions leveraging on the critical membership and umbrella organizations to deliver results;
3. Work to mobilize the entire Private Sector around the SDGs target priority areas for Nigeria;
4. Work to ensure that the entire Private Sector adopts the United Nations Global Compact for the Private Sector on Sustainable Development Goals beginning with its core members and thereafter the TWGs; and
5. Work to facilitate the UN Global Compact and provide the critical Private Sector Development that is required for the paradigm-shift in the Nigerian Business Environment to a Sustainable Development Mindset.
Development Partners Group on SDGs: Government wishes to enhance the existing partnership with the Development Partners in support of the SDGs implementation in Nigeria. There are many avenues through which Development Partners can play vital role in supporting the SDGs implementation. These include, but are not limited to: filling the financing gap through traditional aid (grants and loans); facilitating access to new financing instruments such as Green Bonds/Green Climate Fund; promotion of foreign direct investments; promotion of trade and enterprise development; promoting economic diversification and inclusive growth; provision of technical assistance, capacity development and expertise in specific areas; and promotion of science, technology and innovation to support the implementation of the SDGs.
Government recognizes the need to engage continuously, the Development Partners around the Governmentis strategies, plans and programmes aimed at achieving the SDGs, in a bid to support strategic alignment of donoris programmes to targeted SDGs. 
The Terms of Reference of the Donorsi Forum, to be anchored by the UNDP Nigeria Country Office, include the following: 
? To map development partnersi support against the national development priorities, the SDGs and Addis Ababa Action Agenda commitments and agreements;
? 	To document the full range of resources and ideas that development partners can bring to the table to support SDGs implementation;
? To dialogue, regularly, with Government on interventions and actions needed to achieve the SDGs and in particular, the contribution of development partners;
? 	To report, regularly, on concrete actions taken or planned initiatives to support national priorities in the context of Agenda 2030 and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda; and
? To assist Government in mobilizing financial and non-financial resources for the attainment of the SDGs in Nigeria.
Civil Society Advisory Group on SDGs: Having realized the need for continued advocacy for enhanced commitment of resources to achieving the SDGs and deepening ownership at the Community levels, the OSSAP-SDGs is harnessing the great advocacy and wide-spread potentials of CSOs in Nigeria to advance this course. With facilitative support from the UN-SDG Action Campaign, Nigeria has inaugurated a CSO strategic Group on SDGs, generally referred to as the \0xECCSO Advisory Group on SDGs.
The objective of establishing this group is to build on the efforts of OSSAP-SDGs in increasing knowledge of SDGs, programmes, results, opportunities among others across the Federal, States, LGAs, Communities and the entire citizenry, with a view to stimulating multi-stakeholdersi buy-in, effective response and sustained ownership on the goals, targets, outputs and outcomes. They will adopt suitable advocacy, communication, and citizensi mobilization strategies to accelerate demands and appropriate response around SDGs issues and processes. 
In view of the expected areas of collaboration between OSSAP-SDGs with the CSO group, the office aims to ensure: i) the existence of a working mechanism, (adopting SDGs cluster model as found appropriate) that will guide effective engagement with citizens, government institutions and private sector institutions on SDGs processes across all levels; ii) that members are knowledgeable and appropriately mobilized for the engagement; and iii) that grants and other supports to the group will be prudently utilized on targeted SDGs implementation issues and initiatives that will be highly relevant, sustainable and more impactful to achieving the national SDGs targets.  
National Youth Service Corps (NYSC)/SDGs Champions in Nigeria: This is an NYSC/SDGs Office partnership to organize groups of Corps members who are expected to be drawn from the thirty-six States of the Federation and the FCT, during every cohort of the National Youth Service Scheme. They are to serve as the youth advocates on SDGs in the various communities where they will be deployed for their Community Development National Voluntary Service. The primary purpose of this partnership is to facilitate a countrywide and community-based continuous sensitization on SDGs for improved awareness, citizensi participation and community ownership of SDGs projects and programmes.
In view of the above, Nigeria has established a strong institutional framework to ensure proper coordination on SDGs implementation across the three tiers of government, including private sectors, CSOs, communities, MDAs, the parliament among others. However, effective functionality of each component of the restructure will rely heavily on availability of resources.

4.   IMPLEMENTATION AND RESOURCE MOBILISATION FOR SDGS IN NIGERIA
4.0 	An Overview of the Resource Mobilization Environment
The availability of resources and their mobilization is a critical factor that has to be considered for the realization of the SDGs in Nigeria.  This is more so, given the fact that the implementation of the required programmes and projects will be capital intensive. Moreover, it is a fact that Nigeriais priority developmental needs go well-beyond the SDGs and that these too are competing for funding.  At the same time, Nigeria is struggling with an economic recession that has been exacerbated by her over-reliance on oil revenues that are presently dwindling. The non-oil revenue sources include taxes and excise duties while budget deficits are mostly financed by loans and grants from Development Partners and other international financial institutions. In the meantime, the country has experienced difficulty in tracking the revenue flow from CSOs and private sector. 
Overall, the revenues due to the Federal Government are paid into a consolidated revenue account before being shared amongst the three tiers of government (Federal, State and Local). The federal allocation is derived after statutory transfers to key federal agencies and 13% derivations are paid to the oil producing communities. 
4.1 	Ongoing Fiscal Reforms as Part of SDGs Resource Mobilization 
Given the sharp drop in the price of oil and humanitarian crisis that have challenged the national economy and her 2020 vision, the government has embarked on several reforms and policy interventions that are already beginning to yield positive results. Some of the reform measures undertaken and being pursued include the following:
1. 	Introduction of Treasury Single Account (TSA) 
This is one of the fiscal management measures intended to curb wastage and reduce the cost of running government. Through enforcement of the TSA policy, government has streamlined revenue collections and curbed abuses. Some idle funds within the government systems have been moped up to the tune of N2.5 Trillion as at September 2015,27 leading to huge savings that have contributed to additional domestic resources for investment in sustainable development. 
2. 	Implementation of Appropriate Debt Sustainability Strategies 
A comprehensive review of the national debt profile was carried out and an appropriate debt sustainability strategy produced. As part of the strategy implementation, the country focuses on servicing loans at an optimal cost while investing on sustainable development. 
3. 	Reform of the Internal Revenue Generation System (IGR Reforms) 
At the national level, the Government embarked on comprehensive reform of the Federal Inland Revenue Service and revenue collection points at the port. The reform measures led to the introduction of online transmission of revenues from source to designated government accounts and hence blocking system leakages and boosting the collection from taxes and other internal revenue generation sources, for subsequent investment in sustainable development.
4. 	Technology-based Payroll and Human Resource Management
The introduction of an Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS) in some Federal MDAs has helped in the removal of unproductive workers and frivolous overhead expenditures. The implementation of the IPPIS in some MDAs was first done as a pilot project. With the record of success therefrom, the Federal Government plans to extend its implementation across all the Federal MDAs. Many sub-national governments like the Jigawa State have also recorded great results following the application of IPPIS hence freeing up more resources to be re-invested in other initiatives that would accelerate sustainable development in the country.
5. 	Budget Process Reform 
Nigeria introduced the principles of International Public-Sector Accountability Standards (IPSAS) in her budgeting process from July 2010. The application of IPSAS principles led to a Multi-year Budgeting Framework that reduces the challenge of initiating new projects without completing an ongoing one. It also ensures that resources allocation is linked to related capital and recurrent programmes or activities for each project to enhance functionality and utility. In addition to this, application of IPSAS has enhanced realism in the countryis fiscal forecasting on her Medium Term Fiscal Framework (MTFF), Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and Multi-Year Budget Framework (MYBF). The country has advanced on the application of the IPSAS principles to integrating the principles of Zero Based Budgeting (ZBB), starting with the 2016 national budget. ZBB aims to ensure that resources allocation to MTFF, MTEF and MYBF are realistic and decisions for resource allocation are justified by optimality of evidenced contribution (from review reports). This is aimed at expanding effectiveness, relevance, sustainability and impact of projects and programmes. In 2017 national budget, the use of Multi Criteria Analysis (MCA) model was introduced to the ZBB principles, to strengthen optimality in selection of projects on a balanced scale of \0xECintended results, issues, timeliness, sustainability and cost.
6. 	Enhanced Targeted Support by Development Partners
Many Development Partners are partnering with the Federal Government to provide technical support and capacity building in implementing government identified priority projects and programmes. For instance, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation worked with the Dangote Foundation in supporting Nigeria with funds for her National Programme on Immunization; specifically,  the polio elimination programme.  The World Bank, DFID, UNDP, United States Agency for International Development (USAID), European Union (EU), German Government (GIZ) among many others, have provided support to the government on key areas such as governance and public financial management reforms across federal MDAs and sub-national governments. Loans were provided by the China EXIM bank for funding of critical infrastructure in roads, transportation, water and power supply that will facilitate sustainable development. 
7. 	Implementation of Anti-corruption Programmes 
As the country continues to expand her horizon on anti-corruption campaigns, implementation of some of the anti-corruption interventions, such as, asset disclosure and loot recovery programme, whistle blowersi policy, freedom of information policy, among others, are already yielding results. The recovery of ill-gotten wealth and other measures aimed at deterring corruption are complementing other resource mobilization efforts that will enhance re-investment into select SDG  initiatives. 
8. 	Advocacy and Awareness Campaigns on Combating Illicit Financial Flows 
Given the crucial importance of domestic resource mobilization to the implementation of the SDGs, Nigeria, in collaboration with like-minded Countries has been advocating for the return of illicit and stolen asset to Countries of origin. To advance this, Nigeria and Norway have hosted three seminars in New York on combating illicit financial flows. This was followed up with an international conference held in Abuja, Nigeria on the same topic. The summit of the campaign will be a Presidential side event that will hold during the upcoming UN General Assembly meeting in September 2017. This initiative is aimed at complementing the anti-corruption efforts of President Buhari towards resource mobilization for SDGs implementation.
4.2  Effect of the Fiscal Reforms on Total Retained Revenue for Sustainable Development
The tablesi herebelow provide actual performance indicators of the effect of some of the fiscal reforms that have been discussed in the foregoing section and their effect on the totality of resource mobilization and management. The financial data in the table 4.2.1 below,  confirms the sharp drop on revenue from oil, to more than 56% between 2015 and 2016. The introduction of reforms at revenue collection points has led to nearly double (95.55% increase) the amount of remittance from Nigeriais share of oil sales dividend. 
Other records of revenue increase that could be attributed to the point of collection reforms are 4.39% increase on revenue from mining and mineral resources and 19.71% remittance increase from the share of non-oil revenue; all of which have led to an increase of 11.68% in the total-retained revenue available for budgeting. The country was thus able to cushion the effect of volatility in prices of oil at the international market with the resources mobilized from non-oil sources, which could be attributed to the fiscal reforms, and this has helped Nigeria to deepen her investment in sustainable development.

4.3  	Effect of the Fiscal Reforms on the Medium Term Expenditure Framework 
With a total retained revenue of N3,452.35 Billion and N3,855.74 Billion in 2015 and 2016 respectively, the total national expenditure ceiling for the two years were N4,493.36 Billion and N 6,077.68 Billion. This left an annual deficit of N1,041.01 Billion in 2015, and N2,221.94 Billion in fiscal year 2016. The country borrowed the sum of N1,043.47 Billion and N2,221.94 billion in 2015 and 2016 respectively to finance the budget deficit. While the borrowing from domestic sources increased by 456.33% from 2015 to 2016, borrowing from foreign sources increased by 67.34% from 2015 to 2016. Both the domestic and foreign borrowing helped Nigeria finance her developmental funding gap in the two years. Grants and aids from the development partners also more than doubled (232.23% increase) between the two years (2015 and 2016) of transition from the MDGs to the SDGs.

The ability to cushion the effect of sharp drop in oil-revenue with increased revenue from non-oil sources, from the fiscal reforms, and grants/Aid is a reflection of improved confidence in Nigeriais economy, which has also supported her borrowing capability that enabled financing of the budget deficit to implement planned projects and programmes for sustainable development. With an estimated increase of 28% total retained revenue available for budget between 2016 and 2017, the countryis estimated total budget size for fiscal year 2017 is N7,298 Billion, which represents an increase of 20.4% from 2016 budget size with a budget fiscal deficit of N2,360 Billion. This represents an increase of 6.69% from the 2016 budget fiscal deficit and about 2.18% of the GDP.28 The envisaged sources of financing the 2017 budget deficit is primarily through borrowing of N3,320 Billion, of which N1,067 Billion (representing 46%) is projected to be sourced externally, while N1,250 Billion (representing 54%) is projected to be sourced domestically, with a projected debt service to revenue ratio of 33.7% in fiscal year 2017.
Although Nigeria is yet to complete estimation of financial investment required to achieve realistic SDGs results, in addition to integrating many SDGs related interventions in her National Development Policy and Plan (NERGP) for appropriate financing, huge financial gap on full SDGs implementation is already being anticipated. As already stated in the NERGP, Nigeria commits to deepening these budget reform initiatives and other efforts on domestic resource mobilization. Although, Nigeria has demonstrated strong commitment to domestic resource mobilization for implementation of the SDGs, the country will need the support of the international community for enhanced aid flow with improved aid architecture and predictability for enhanced financing sustainable development.  
4.4  	Overview on Data Availability for the SDGs Performance Tracking
Nigeriais Statistical System comprises those of the Federal Government; the various States and Local Governments. The Office responsible for National Statistics was initially the Federal Office of Statistics (FoS), but owing to prolonged Military rule, the office suffered serious setbacks in terms of appropriate infrastructure, capacity, space, funding and a stream of other needs that prevented her from operating efficiently. The Office was subsequently renamed the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) and a Statistics Act passed which automatically repositioned and refocused it with a specific mandate and vision. Since then, the office has endeavoured to operationally execute her vision. However, it was the Millennium Development Goals period that ushered in a new era for statistical development and practice in the country because its monitoring and appraisal was data driven. Not only did it give publicity to the role of statistics in development but it equally called for reforms. The KRQ here is thus premised on the following: KRQ:  How Enabling is the National Statistical System in support of SDGs Data Availability?
4.4.1  	Organizational Mechanism for Collection of Official National Statistics
The NBS has launched the second phase of the National Strategy for the Development of Statistics (NSDS) built upon a solid framework of vertical and horizontal collaboration and which enhances access by benefitting from economies of scale. Within this dispensation, any agency could collaborate with the NBS in the area of capacity building on data capturing and management in a bid to make data available for the SDGs.  
In her recent project on the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), the NBS adapted the Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) hand n held device in order to facilitate speedy data collection and processing within a given time. That is a big improvement from the previous paper-based questionnaires. It is also important to note that the NBS disaggregates her data by sub region, state, sex and sector as a regular convention. The NBS also operates a portal that is both locally and internationally accessible and the office is committed to carrying out her mandate within the bounds of its enabling Act. 
At the sub-national level, only few States have enacted the legal framework that will enable their statistical offices to function as the State Bureau of Statistics (SBS). The absence of such legal framework in many States, limits their effective functionality as it restricts their demand for resource allocation, scope of operation and political influence on the status of official statistics. Nevertheless, all the States are making unrelenting efforts to provide official state statistics. For instance, Kaduna, Jigawa, and Ebonyi States have advanced with the SDGs data mapping and data revolution for data sets collection and collation .
It has been the practice of the Bureau to collect data at both national and subnational levels. The State Bureau of Statistics and the State Statistical Agencies form part of the survey team to achieve data collection coverage across the 36 States of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Though the reporting domain may be at the state, the actual information is usually collected from clusters in the LGAs.
4.4.2  	Gaps in National Official Statistics and the SDGs
The NBS has three data production systems namely:
(i) 	The National Integrated Survey of Households (NISH) (ii) 	The National Integrated Survey of Establishment (NISE) (iii) 	The System of Administrative Statistics (SAS).
The operation of each system relates with its name such that the NISH is for all household surveys and the NISE is for establishment surveys while the SAS is for administrative statistics. 
The major household surveys include the National Living Standard Survey (NLSS), Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), Core Welfare Indicator Questionnaire Survey (CWIQ) and others. 
These surveys and a few others are all funded by International Development Partners (IDPs) such that whatever affects the IDP budgets may also impact on the Bureau.  Gaps thus occur in the ability of the Bureau to collect data whenever the surveys are not funded by the IDPs. Another peculiar gap is that of the SAS; where notably, the data is often available but does not conform to the prescribed format for measuring specific indicators. Other gaps revolve around capacity and funding.
4.4.3  	Mapping of SDGs Data with Data Production Sources and Management
At the inception of the SDGs, the NBS in collaboration with the UNDP carried out the SDGs indicatorsi mapping at the federal level. The exercise played a dual role, in that it not only created an opportunity for publicity on the SDGs as a new development agenda, but also tracked MDAs that were responsible to which indicator(s). The SDGs mapping was a grand exercise that enabled the previewing of the enormity of statistical activities in the SDGs.  It also facilitated the scoping of the MDAs with regard to organizational structure and capacity. Given that the same mapping exercise was carried out at the sub-regional level, the sharing of experiences were unlimited.
4.4.4  	Lessons From the MDGs Experience
The MDGs commenced in 2000, with 1990 as the baseline year but Nigeria, apparently, only joined in 2005. There was however no base line.  Before the year 2000, Nigeria faced isolation from the international community due to the extended periods of military government. Consequently, endeavours such as the MDGs remained latent and were only activated upon the actualization of Nigeriais third democratic republic. Thus, although the MDGs were globally adopted in September 2000 by most nations, including Nigeria, it was only upon the appointment of the Senior Special Assistant to the President, coupled with the debt forgiveness initiative that brought the programme into lime light. Nigeria therefore started late and did not have any reliable statistics on the most critical sectors including agriculture and food security; poverty, health and education; water and sanitation, environment and governance in general. This non-availability of numerical information became the bane and challenge in monitoring the MDGs and thus subsequently providing the springboard necessary for the development of capacities in collecting and collating official statistics.
The SDGs data mapping was initiated to forestall a re-occurrence of the ugly situation of lack of data experienced during the MDGs. The UNDP in collaboration with the NBS mounted the programme on data mapping at both federal and state levels with the imperative that Nigeria needed to start and keep pace with other nations. Apart from data mapping, the programme was targeted at creating awareness about the SDGs and identifying Nigeriais data needs and confirming their availability. The programme provided an opportunity to gauge the technical capacity of the MDAs in producing performance data required in tracking progress on the SDGs indicators and also deliberating on the frequency of their production. 
Overall, the whole effort was geared towards avoiding late commencement of the SDG data gathering for monitoring and evaluation.  Annex one in this review contains the result of the first SDGs data mapping exercise done in the Country with base line data on one hundred and twenty (120) assembled from multiples sources and primarily from Systems of Administrative Statistics (SAS) and existing survey reports.
4.4.5  The Data Mapping Process and its Challenges 
The data mapping process took place in 2015 with an initial stage that involved the engagement of a consultant for a period of about three months to study the indicators and identify the various data sets required and the sources of such data.  A three-day second stage involved invitations to a retreat, of all the federal MDAs in order to go through the indicators relative to their mandates and confirm or adjust the earlier articulation by the consultant.  The last stage was the validation, in which the MDAs alongside stakeholders such as the CSOs; IDPs NGOs and other relevant groups were invited for their inputs and comments.  A similar process was replicated at the sub regional level. In the meantime, another consultant was engaged to juxtapose the Statistical Year Book (SYB) for both the Federal and State Governments, with the global SDGs indicators, in order to ascertain the indicators content and uniformity in the two documents. At the end of the exercise, it was discovered that the SDGs had numerous indicators that were not in the SYB.
In this entire exercise, three critical gaps or challenges were identified. The first was the acute funding gaps, followed by the limited capacity of MDAs staff on SDGs data needs, documentation, assemblage, analysis and reporting. Both factors have an over bearing influence on the activities of all the MDAs and statistical officers. The third challenge relates to appropriate indicator definitions and contextualization in Nigeria. Some of the SDGs indicators were alien to the traditional Nigeriais statistical context and scope. 
It is considered that the three challenges identified will require serious attention at both national and subnational levels if data availability, performance measurement and subsequent performance reviews of the SDGs is to be assured.  
4.4.6  	Introduction of the Open Data Concept
Open data is data that can be freely used, re-used and redistributed by anyone. The NBS became a signatory to the agreement on open data and has a link with the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS). In addition, the African Development Bank is considering training for the NBS, CBN and others on the open data platform by June 2017, in order to operationalize it. 
All in all, although it can be said that there is some progress on the statistical front, the review indicates a weak system and hence more effort needed in order to improve and thereby directly contribute to SDGs indicator 17.18.2.

5. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS, LESSONS, NEXT STEPS AND CONCLUSIONS
5.0  	Summary
An analysis of the information generated from this review reveals that Nigeria has advanced on achieving national ownership of the SDGs with good progress on integration into the national policy and planning frameworks. While acknowledging key areas that still require effort and improvement, the main areas of successes, challenges, lessons and emerging issues, have been identified in order to guide policy and programme direction for accelerated implementation and better performance in the years ahead.
5.1  	The Key SDGs Successes
Given the foregoing analyses, the countryis major SDGs implementation successes can be disaggregated into, about seven major clusters as summarized hereunder:
1. Strengthened National Awareness, Political Commitment and Ownership: There can be no doubt that there exists today, a significant and highly enhanced level of national awareness and ownership of the SDGs in Nigeria. The ownership extends across all the 36 State Governments and the FCT and includes the 774 LGAs; over 9,000 community structures and a wide range of public and Private Sector institutions, alongside CSOs and other non-state actors.  The national ownership and political commitment is evidenced  in the establishment of an office within the presidency who has express responsibility for ensuring appropriate integration of the SDGs into the overall national strategic framework, including in the budgets. The State Governments and the LGAs have all established similar offices or units at their own levels.
2. Institutional Strengthening for SDGs Intervention: Nigeria has established a strong institutional framework to ensure proper coordination of the SDGs implementation across the three tiers of government. These include coordination within the private sectors, CSOs, communities, MDAs, the parliament and others. The office of the SSAP-SDGs has made advances in establishing coordinating structures across the tiers of government for purposes of horizontal and vertical coherence of program information and effective performance management. The structure has within it, MDA focal persons, State focal persons, LGAs focal persons as well as an Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) on SDGs.   
In terms of the legislatures, two select Committees on SDGs have been established in the Senate and House of Representatives with the aim of enhancing the legislative and oversight functions on SDGs activities, with special focus on speedy appropriation. In addition to this, the OSSAP-SDGs has entered into an inter-agency partnership with the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) in order to train graduating youths into becoming SDGs Champions in their local communities and areas of national service upon deployment; with the objective of deepening SDGs advocacy and sensitization campaign within the communities.
Overall, there has been a good demonstration of sound reforms and the building of strong publicsector institutions coupled with requisite fiscal responsiveness. The notable efforts include the aforementioned budget process reforms, implementation of appropriate debt sustainability strategies, IGRs reforms, introduction of TSA, IPPIS and IPSAS, and many others. The anticorruption interventions and fiscal reforms are already contributing to the total resource basket for implementation of the sustainable development programs in the country.
3. Integration of the SDGs into National Policy and Planning Frameworks:  Prior to the SDGs, Nigeria had integrated the SDGs into her long-term plan (NV20:2020). Also, as part of the outcomes of the sensitization and advocacy, the NERGP, on which the current medium- and short- terms budgeting frameworks are based, is to a large extent, aligned to the SDGs. Similarly, many of the current State Development Plans (SDPs), including that of Benue, Taraba, Yobe, Kaduna, Ebonyi, Kano, Jigawa, Anambra, Delta States, to mention but a few, are aligned to the SDGs. The alignment aids in the planning, monitoring and evaluation of the SDGs implementation. Similarly, the three dimensions of SDGs are well incorporated into the three pillars of the NERGP. The SDGs costings are also extensively integrated into the annual budgets of 2016 and 2017, with a hopeful outlook in the MTEF.   
Furthermore, Nigeria has recorded two special intervention programs that directly address issues on eradicating poverty and promoting prosperity in line with the Thematic Focus on the 2017 HLPF. The Social Intervention Program (SIP) which focuses on the poor and vulnerable groups provides direct support in terms of knowledge, skills, access to finance and conditional cash to poor and vulnerable households. Meanwhile, the Conditional Grant Scheme focuses on stimulating subnational government (States and LGAs) to 50% and 20% of the financial resources required for SDGsrelated direct interventions in their annual budgets, respectively.
The select SDGs for the 2016 CSG was on provision of portable water (SDG-6), quality health care (SDG-3) as well as educational services and infrastructure (SDG-4). These are some of the goals that contribute to addressing issues resulting from income poverty that deprives access to quality social services. The two programs (the SIP and CGS) have a balance on demand and supply side which relate to expanding opportunities for enhanced access to basic social services by the poor and removing barriers to prosperity.
4. SDGs Data Revolution, Monitoring and Evaluation:  It is pertinent noting that an SDGs data mapping exercise has been concluded and a data supply responsibility framework agreed upon. Working in collaboration with the NBS, the OSSAP-SDGs has done extensive work on ensuring the production and availability of  the critical baseline data that was, in fact, not available in the MDGs era. With hindsight and learning from the previous national Medium Term development plans, and given the vision of being one of the top 20 economies in the world by the year 2020, the country has established a Presidential Delivery Unit (PDU), with a primary mandate to drive achievement of the NERGP results. In view of the fact that the SDGs have been extensively integrated in the NERGP, its specific achievement will directly contribute to the achievement of Agenda 2030. With the establishment of the National Social Register, the dynamics of issues relating to poverty and prosperous opportunities in the changing world could be minimized with evidence based planning and interventions.
	5. 	Economic Diversification and Resource Mobilisation
The targeted diversification into agriculture is already yielding positive results with farmers being empowered on rice production. Given the increased levels of production, it is estimated that Nigeriais rice will enter the international market by 2017. For instance, Kebbi State had already harvested one million tons of rice, while Ebonyiis harvest has outstripped the earmarked production target for the year.  A significant number of farmers have gained access to credit for Agriculture and Agro-allied investment, in order to enhance yield and support food security in the country. In this regard, the Anchor Borrowersi Program (ABP) has recorded good response on repayment. For example, as at March 31, 2017, a total sum of N33.34 billion was released to 12 participating finance institutions while a total of 146,557 farmers were provided with credit. The farmers are cultivating over 180,018 hectares of land, across 21 States. In Kebbi State, out of a total of about N15.137 billion disbursed to 73,941 farmers, N7.119 billion representing 47 per cent has been fully repaid and returned to CBN.
With the good Advancement on Partnership and Collaboration, the country has established platforms with organized sectors, with a view to advancing effective implementation of the SDGs. In this regard, the Private Sector Advisory Group (PSAG) and the Donorsi Forum on the SDGs have been inaugurated as early as 2017. The CSOs Group on SDGs is already working towards the realisation of some SDGs targets and recording giant strides on inclusive education in collaboration with the Joint Association of Persons with Disability (JONAPWD) and Women 2030 in Nigeria.
Nigeria is further facilitating a multi-stakeholder and multi-cluster approach to implementing and harnessing interventions on SDGs through the PSAG and CSOs partners and by establishing technical clusters around various SDGs targets and indicators that relate to their respective organizationis areas of work. Such arrangements clearly contributes to the achieving of SDGs target 17.17 on encouraging and promoting effective public, private and CSO partnerships and for building on resourcing strategies of partnerships.
Lastly, by promoting a \0xEBdigital led growthi, the country expects through the NERGP to build on the \0xECSmart Nigeria Digital Economy which is focussed on establishing an ICT ecosystem. It aims at significantly expanding broadband coverage, increasing e-government, and establishing ICT clusters. As part of implementing these strategies, government is building relevant skills that will drive growth in the sector, focusing on training IT Engineers on software development, programming, networking, and cyber security. The policy is aimed at increasing the contribution from ICT and ICT enables activities to GDP. 
	6. 	Targeting the Poor and \0xEBLeaving No one Behind: The establishment of a \0xECNational Social 
Registerii for the poor and vulnerable households is a signature initiative that the Government is determined to ensure that no one is left behind during the SDGs era. The conditional cash transfer of five thousand naira (N5,000) to the poor and vulnerable households is part of the national social safety net program.
It can be said that in various parts of the country, women are occupying higher positions and they are also advancing on actualizing rights to inheritance and acquisition of property. The women are beginning to influence personal and family decisions, while increasingly advancing in entrepreneurship, businesses and professional life. Furthermore, the country has advanced in developing and enforcing policies which will ensure that the special developmental needs and concerns of persons with disability and the girl-child are integrated into the educational systems at national and sub-national levels. The government is already refurbishing the educational infrastructure to add ramps and appropriate playing, teaching and toilet facilities. The curriculum of Teachers Training Colleges are being revised to ensure inclusion of teaching skills that are responsive to learning needs of persons with disability.
7. Resource Mobilization for SDGs Implementation: Whereas Nigeria is yet to complete the estimation and costing of the financial investment required in order to achieve realistic SDGs results, in addition to integrating many SDGs-related interventions into her NERGP for appropriate financing, huge financial gaps pertaining to the full SDGs implementation is already anticipated. However, within the NERGP Nigeria commits to deepening budget reform initiatives and other efforts on domestic resource mobilization. Although the country has demonstrated strong commitment to domestic resource mobilization for the implementation of SDGs, she will still need the support and collaboration with the international community in order to enhance aid flow with improved aid architecture and predictability so as to enhance the financing of sustainable development. The present government has advanced on its effort to mobilize resources for investment in sustainable development initiatives. Such efforts which cut across anti-corruption interventions, such as reduction in illicit financial flow, strengthening the recovery and return of stolen assets and combating all sorts of organised crime through enforcement of policies like whistle blower Policy.
5.2  	Summary of Challenges 
In spite of the successes listed in the preceding section, the implementation of the SDGs cannot be said to be without some challenges from which some key lessons have also emerged. The most remarkable challenges that may impede the journey towards the SDGs can be summarised to include the following:
1. Over-Reliance on the Oil and Gas Sector; dwindling agricultural production and productivity as well as limited value addition in the agricultural sector: Growing the economy in its entirety; creating jobs, addressing poverty and ensuring food security, all remain critical challenges. The economic recession in the country due to fluctuating oil prices in the international market is a critical challenge facing the SDGs while the  dwindling in agricultural productivity is mainly due to climate change, desertification as well as natural and man-made disasters coupled with unresponsive land tenure systems and a general low utilization of mechanized farming. 
2. Infrastructural Deficit and Technological Gaps:  The other major challenge to the realisation of the SDGs is the infrastructure and technology deficits, both of which hinder service provision and the application of Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) in many spheres of life.
3. Humanitarian Crisis: The humanitarian crisis in the North-East of the country, as well as the NigerDelta militancy and the herdsmen/famersi crisis present unique challenges to the achievement of the SDGs. The government has embarked on several peace building initiatives and programmes to manage internally displaced persons.  
4. Weak Public-Sector Institutions: There are a number of public sector institutions that are still quite weak and therefore unable to actualize their institutional and organizational mandates. Institutional weaknesses and shortcomings are a source of challenges to the smooth process of actualising SDGs implementation. 
5. SDGs Data Availability and Accessibility: Whereas commendable progress has been made to ensure that data is available for planning the various SDGs interventions and their tracking, the country still faces the challenge of weak data production and management system across the three tiers of government.  
5.3  	Emerging Issues Requiring Support
Although Nigeria has endeavoured to respond to the many emerging issues that pose challenges to the effective implementation and ultimate realisation of the SDGs, there are a number of areas in which the country will require support from the international community.  The two most important are the following: 
1. Resource Mobilisation: Given the current economic recession that seems to limit Nigeriais domestic resource mobilization efforts, the country will require support in mobilizing adequate financial and other resources, including from domestic sources, and through traditional (North n South, South n South and triangular cooperation) partnerships. 
2. Technology transfer and capacity building:  This will be required to support data production and the related performance information management which are useful in accelerating welltargeted implementation of the various SDGs initiatives. It will also help in improving efficiency in performance accountability and attainment of the nationally agreed SDGs targets for 2030. 
5.4  	Key Lessons from the Review
There are at the very least, four pivotal lessons from this review exercise:
1. The Need for Data-Driven Technology-Based and Performance Accountability Systems: The country recognizes that technology-based, open and transparent progress-tracking; performance accountability and reporting systems for nationally agreed targets against set benchmarks, are critical for the success of the SDGs implementation.
2. The Need for Innovative Approaches for tackling Bureaucratic Bottlenecks:  It is necessary to devise innovative and adaptive practices as well as programme delivery mechanisms that can enable Nigeria to overcome various bureaucratic bottlenecks often associated with the implementation of most national policies and programmes. It is noteworthy here that the  OSSAPSDGs has moved to establish an Inter-Ministerial Committee on SDGs and MDAs focal persons, in order to try and deal with some of these bottlenecks. 
3. The Pivotal Role of Strong Partnerships for SDGs Implementation and Realisation: The role of Official Development Assistance (ODA) and debt financing through debt relief gains; domestic resource mobilization and new and alternative sources of financing, are critical to the successful resourcing of SDGs implementation in the country. Effective global and national partnerships are therefore, vital for the SDGs implementation process.
4. The Necessity for Availability and Accessibility of an SDGs Performance Database: With the benefit of hindsight and the experience that was encountered as a result of the absence of baseline data on the MDGs indicators before their implementation, Nigeria has now made commendable effort in ensuring the availability of critical baseline data on the SDGs indicators through the aforementioned data mapping and baseline activities. As the country advances its SDGs agenda, these efforts will be strengthened across the country in order to build a timely and accessible SDGs performance database.  
5.5  	Next Steps on Implementation of SDGs in Nigeria
Having achieved a relatively good record of success in establishing the policy and enabling environment that will accelerate implementation of SDGs related interventions, there are other initiatives that are critical to actualization of the SDGs. While some of these initiatives have already started, others are yet to commence. Within the current fiscal year, the following is a considered list of select activities that are critical to the consolidation of the achieved progress: 
i. Estimation of Investment Portfolio and Results Realism for targeted interventions
There is an ongoing plan to conduct a Needs Assessment and Policy Analysis and estimate the cost of SDGs related programmes, projects and activities. This is aimed at establishing the volume of financial resources required for achieving the SDGs and to also guide other resource mobilization efforts in partnership with the MDAs, sub-national governments, and development partners. 
ii. Deepen integration of the SDGs -Related programmes into sector plans and implementation plans of the NERGP
OSSAP-SDGs has commenced arrangement for inter-agency engagement for integration of the SDGs related programmes and projects within the MTSSs of key sectors, work-plans of relevant MDAs, and the strategic implementation plan of the NERGP. This is aimed at deepening existing SDGs integration into the annual budgets for resource allocation and implementation.
iii. Enhance the strategic framework for effective implementation: 
To accelerate effective implementation of the SDGs related programmes and the national and subnational level, OSSAP-SDGs aims to deploy a strategic tool for Mainstreaming, Accelerating and Policy Support (MAPS).
iv. Develop an SDGs Results Framework: 
OSSAP-SDGs aims to coordinate development of Nigeriais realistic and agreed performance milestones and benchmarks across a select set of SDGs targets and indicators. This will provide framework of results the country will realistically promise to deliver on. It will also form the framework for performance tracking, reporting and accountability. 
v. Integration of SDGs into the revised National Long-Term Plan: 
Nigeria is at the verge of revising her long-term plan, NV20:2020. OSSAP-SDGs plans to work closely with the Ministry for Budget and National Planning to facilitate proper integration of the SDGs and its three dimensions in the revised long-term vision document.  
vi. Advancing the SDGs monitoring to outcome performance monitoring: 
The OSSAP-SDGs already has a functional unit on Monitoring and Evaluation. The current operations of the unit are very vast on tracking SDGs directly funded projects and their outputs. With the vast integration of SDGs in the NERGP, the office plans to advance this effort to outcome and impact level performance monitoring and ensuring proper integration of the SDGs indicators into the national M&E framework for the NERGP. In addition to this, there will be a comprehensive review of the OSSAP-SDGsi OPEN M&E System.
vii. Developing and SDGs Information Management System: 
During the implementation of the MDGs, Nigeria developed an MDGs Information Management System (NMIS). The NMIS served as a repository web portal for all MDGs project and performance information/ data. With the transition from MDGs to SDGs, OSSAP-SDGs has concluded plans to review and rebrand the NMIS into an NSIS to continue to serve the same purpose.
viii. Strengthening partnerships and collaborative platforms in order to accelerate implementation: 
Nigeria has planned to harmonize the Agenda 2063 with Agenda 2030, in collaboration with the UN Economic Commission for Africa, providing the necessary platform for the integration. As part of the partnership strengthening plan, OSSAP-SDGs will work closely with the established partnership platforms, development partners forum on SDGs, to accelerate implementation of SDGs interventions through the Appropriations for the Conditional Grant Scheme at the sub-national levels as well as the SDGs Social Safety Net programmes across the country. 
ix. Deepening Advocacy and Communication for intended and targeted behaviour change:
The UN-SDGs Action Campaign has supported the OSSAP-SDGs to produce a draft SDGs communication strategy for Nigeria. An immediate focus will be to complete and commence implementation of the communication strategy. Existing structures, such as the CSOs Group on SDGs, National Orientation Agency, SDGs champions, SDGs focal persons at MDAs and sub-national governments and other relevant stakeholders, will be used to facilitate the implementation of this strategy.  


A Concluding Statement
The results from the political commitment, advocacy and awareness efforts made by the Government of Nigeria have undoubtedly led to giant leaps, especially evidenced in the strong SDGs national ownership. The ownership is backed by an equally well-demonstrated high-level political commitment and an increased appetite for ensuring purposive SDG interventions built around strong institutions that are expected to drive the vertical and horizontal coordination of the SDG agenda implementation. There is evidence of extensive integration of the SDGs into the main national development policy and planning blueprint (NERGP) as well as within the various State Development Plans. The integration assures an excellent political and policy environment for accelerated implementation of the critical SDGs-related initiatives. 
Nigeria has also demonstrated great potential and commitment to domestic resource mobilization from which the much-needed SDGs funding will emanate.  Nevertheless, domestic sources are inadequate and cannot replace the need for increased resource availability from strategic partnerships such as those broached with Nigeriais Private Sector players; the ODA from our various international partners, and above all, community level partnerships that the Government of Nigeria is encouraging and promoting at every level. Needless to stress it, the Government and the people of Nigeria collectively commit to strengthening the spirit of national ownership to and deepen the process of continuous sensitization and awareness on the SDGs, particularly through a robust and vigorous engagement with the grassroots based CSOs. 
As is evident in the report, the importance of timely, accurate and reliable data cannot be overemphasised in this endeavour, because of the singular importance of such data in tracking both the use of our scarce resources and also, in providing the actual evidence of our national progress in all the SDG targets and indicators. Hand in hand with data availability, must be our national readiness to adopt the appropriate technological and capacity strengthening strategies that are the very brick and mortar of national development.
In concluding, we reiterate that in integrating the pertinent lessons derived from this very review process into the fabric of our public sector policies, we also commit to regular reviews and that we shall continue to subscribe to the open data initiative, in order to ensure that SDGs programmes and activities are mainstreamed in the MTSS, MTEF as well as in the annual budgets of the MDAs. 
The OSSAP-SDGs therefore undertakes to do all in its power and authority to further build on the established institutional framework and to ensure effective performance management of SDGs results delivery.

ANNEX-2:  CSO Statement of Validation of the Nigeria 2017 NVR 
 
A DETAILED REVIEW OF THE FINAL DRAFT OF THE NATIONAL VOLUNTARY REPORT

1.0  INTRODUCTION
On behalf of the CSOs Advisory Group in Nigeria, we acknowledge and appreciate the opportunity for inclusivity to review and provide a detailed information on the final draft of the National Voluntary Report (NVR) in fulfilment and requirement by the UN, of the validation of the final draft report before its submission. The report provides information on progress and status of implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Nigeria, alongside with key policy, institutional and regulatory measures that facilitated the mainstreaming of SDGs in national policies, plans and programs, and its coherent coordination.  For the sake of this review, cognizance has been taken of; the level of compliance with the process, coverage of the entire information requirement to form the content of the report and, finally, the validity of progress information the government has reported.
2.0 THE LEVEL OF THE PROCESS COMPLIANCE WITH THE NVR 
GUIDELINES
The report is in compliance with the process defined for it, invariably the due process is followed accordingly. The Office of the Senior Special Assistant to the President on SDGs (OSSAP-SDGs) constituted an inter-ministerial and non-governmental Core Working Group with the primary responsibility of handling the overall management of the consultative processes for information gathering, assuring content standard of the report and delivery timelines.
The compilation of the content of the National Voluntary report and its structure is strictly done within the guideline included in the report of the UN Secretary General. The first step in the consultative process was information gathering through structured template with relevant information around various sections of the report where CSOs and others were consulted.  Secondly, the conduct of a one-day national consultative workshop for an extensive discussion and presentations by various stakeholders on preinformed thematic areas around the SDGs which also served as a sensitization of the public on the SDGs.
The CSOs played the role of documenting negotiations at the six technical sessions that were held during the one-day consultative workshop, while the Private sector members moderated some of the technical sessions. Some other sources of information obtained in the compilation of the report were desk review of existing national documents and reports such as the Nigeria Vision 20:2020, NERGP, SDPs, Transition Strategy to SDGs, MDGs End-Point report, among others. The desk review guaranteed an alignment of the collated information with the official national reports. The Ministry of Budget and National Planning and its National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) equally provided financial and statistical data for the NVR.
3.0  THE COVERAGE OF THE INFORMATION REQUIRED BY THE GUIDELINE
The report makes available information on progress and status of implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Nigeria. It highlighted key policy, institutional and regulatory measures drawn to create an enabling environment for mainstreaming of SDGs in national policies, plans and programs, and its intelligible synchronisation. The NVR however is a product of an in-depth and consultative analysis with a wide assortment of stakeholders drawn from line ministries, civil society organizations, organized private sector, academia, development partners, youth groups, women organizations, persons with disability and media organization, which has satisfactorily aligned with the expected coverage of information requirement that constitutes the core body of the report. 
The need to further deepen the involvement of the Local Government Authorities, People with Disabilities, Aging Group, Youth and Women is critical, as the SDGs cannot be meant by 2030 if any critical section of the stakeholders are left behind. Furthermore, the report has provided information on Nigeriais progress on policy and strategy response to the SDGs, baseline status on 69 select indicators with projection on their path to target agenda 2030. It also contained a highlight of how the country has made ownership of the goals through multi-stakeholder sensitization and advocacy campaigns. It provides information on how the Country has incorporated SDGs in national policies, plans and budgets while integrating the three dimensions of SDGs, the economic, social, and environmental dimensions. The report also provided facts on progress on institutional mechanisms for effective implementation of the SDGs and resource mobilization initiatives. 
The zero-draft report was first reviewed by the Core Working Group after which an improved version was circulated to the wider stakeholder for further review, input and validation. The national validation workshop therefore, provides another space where additional inputs would be made by participants for integration, after which the final report will produced. 
4.0  THE VALIDITY OF PROGRESS 
INFORMATION THE GOVERNMENT HAS 
REPORTED
The legal operating environment in Nigeria considers bills passed by the parliament as proposed developmental areas for consideration by the executive arm of government. They become an act (federal level) or a law (State level) when signed by the President or State Governor. Likewise, the global declaration on SDGs represents a global acceptance but proposed developmental areas for consideration and possible integration into national development planning and strategic frameworks by the participating countries. Nigeria signed unto the UN declaration on the SDGs declaration by President Muhammadu Buhari, on September 25, 2015. 
The office of the Senior Special Assistant to the President on the SDGs (OSSAP-SDGs) coordinates the activities of the SDGs at both the national and sub-national level (States and Local Government). This office has the mandate to mobilize the support and political will of key stakeholders for the realization of the SDGs.  
Across the 36 states of the federation, the 
State Governments have appointed SDG focal Persons with the mandate of coordinating the implementation of the SDGs and targets in line with the directives issued by the OSSAP-SDG. The Nigeria Economic Recovery and Growth Plan 2017-2020 has been formulated as a medium- term development strategy which will manage Nigeriais economic transition process from recession to the path of inclusive growth, sustainable development, and prosperity. This plan will enable the government to diversify the economy, accelerate investments in infrastructure, human capital, and key social sectors, create jobs and pursue reforms that will leverage the power of the private sector.
To further buttress, the Government of Nigeria has embarked on an SDG Needs Assessment and costing exercise which we hope will make available to us some needed baseline information and data to plan for subsequent investments across regions and sectors for effective resource use and impact.
5.0  CONCLUSION
The results from the political commitment, advocacy and awareness efforts have resulted in giant strides being made on strong national SDGs ownership, high political commitment, increased appetite for SDG interventions and strong institutions, for driving coordination. This would lead to extensive integration of SDGs in the national development policy and plan as well as State Development Plans.  Nigeria has also demonstrated great potential for domestic resource mobilization from which SDGs funding will benefit. 
The country however needs to be more committed to strengthening her ownership and deepening a continuous sensitization and awareness on SDGs with more engagement of the CSOs and the private sector. Ensuring timely data availability, adoption of appropriate technological and capacity strengthening is needful for advancing of SDGs implementation. OSSAP-SDGs needs to continue to build on the established institutional framework to ensure effective performance management of SDGs results delivery.
