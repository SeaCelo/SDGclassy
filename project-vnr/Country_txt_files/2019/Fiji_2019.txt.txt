2. Executive Summary

Fiji’s unprecedented progress in recent years has been both guided and inspired by aims of the 2030 Agenda and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. Fiji’s commitment towards sustainable development is reflected across the nation’s development aspirations and engrained within the three pillars of Fijian democracy, the judiciary, the legislature and the executive. 
Fiji’s VNR is a comprehensive review of the implementation of the transformative 2030 Agenda and its 17 SDGs. As Fiji’s first-ever national review of this nature, the Fijian government has made a special effort to ensure inclusivity throughout the exercise, underpinned by an unwavering commitment to leaving no Fijian behind. 
Fiji’s 5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plans are the blueprints for Fiji’s continued development through 2030 and beyond. The plans, both developed through a nationwide consultation process, embody the key goals and principles of the SDGs. Through the NDP, Fiji has mapped out our agendas for climate action, green growth, environmental protection, gender equality, disability assistance and good governance, along with the development of new and existing sectors of our economy and other key metrics of societal progress. The NDP recognises the natural synergies that exist between these development areas, and minimises overlaps and maximises efficiency through a cross-cutting interagency approach.
As Fiji’s democracy has matured, the Fijian Parliament has strengthened its key role in promoting, implementing and monitoring the progress of the SDGs in Fiji. Likewise, the judiciary promotes the implementation of the SDGs through its strong and independent institutions and its committed effort to expand the reach of legal services across the country. 
Fiji’s unprecedented streak of ten years of unbroken economic growth has been the engine powering Fijian progress towards the attainment of the 17 SDGs. Unemployment has reached at two decade-low and the percentage of Fijians living in poverty is steadily decreasing. On the back of historic investment towards education, Fiji has achieved universal access to primary education. Rates of child and maternal mortalities are falling.
Access to social welfare and economic services are increasing. Fiji has led the world in taking on two of the greatest challenges facing humanity, climate change and ocean degradation, and Fiji is leading at home in driving resilient and sustainable development across rural and urban areas alike. 
But Fiji is not resting on its laurels. There is still a great deal of work left undone and many challenges on the horizon in securing development that is sustainable over the long-term. Fiji badly requires greater resources and capacity to fully implement the SDGs at all levels of Fijian society, and Fiji is urgently calling for greater access to finance in this aim. SDG 17 is Partnerships, and only through partnerships can Fiji realise the 2030 Agenda in its totality. That will require collaboration with the private sector and development organisations to ensure that Fiji’s future progress remains widereaching and inclusive
To consistently and reliably track progress, Fiji will commit significant funding towards monitoring and evaluations processes that continually assess SDG implementation against pre-determined benchmarks. This VNR is a valuable tool in determining where Fiji stands in relation to the 17 SDGs and which areas require greater attention and funding to fully implement the global goals.



Fiji is a small island country with an estimated population of 884,887 people in 2017. It has 332 islands with a total land area of about 18,300 square kilometres. The country has abundant natural resources and is one of the most developed countries in the Pacific region. The World Bank classifies Fiji as an upper-middle income country. In 2017, Fiji’s GDP per capita was USD5,589 and GDP reached USD5.06 billion. The 2018 Human Development Report released by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) categorises Fiji as a High Human Development country, and the country is ranked 92nd among 189 counties. Table 1 lists some key social and economic indicators for Fiji. 
plan of action for people, planet and prosperity, expected to be implemented by all countries and all stakeholders, acting in collaborative partnership, through bold and transformative steps which are urgently needed to shift the world onto a sustainable and resilient path. The SDGs raise the bar from the MDGs substantially and aims to achieve a paradigm shift in many key development areas. The transformative agenda seeks to finish the unfinished business of the MDGs through its focuses on the five Ps (People, Planet, Prosperity, Peace and Partnership).

During the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) period between 2000 and 2015, Fiji achieved four of the MDGs. It has achieved universal primary education (MDG 2) by 2013, has reduced the under-five and infant mortality (MDG 4) to less than 20 deaths per 1,000 new births, has reduced maternal mortality (MDG 5) to less than 20 deaths per 100,000 live births, and has achieved the targets (forest coverage, access to improved water and sanitation services etc.) set under MDG 7. It also made significant progress in the other MDGs. 12
In 2015, Fiji made its commitment to achieve the 2030 Agenda and its seventeen SDGs. The 2030 Agenda is a

(NDP) developed through a comprehensive nationwide stakeholder consultation process embodies the SDGs. The NDP with a vision of “Transforming Fiji” is based on the principles of sustainable development and addresses many cross-cutting themes such as climate change, green growth, the environment, gender equality, disability and governance across the various sections recognising the integrated nature of development. Many of the SDG goals and targets have been localised in the NDP indicating that the global goals are implemented through the national policy, planning and budgetary mechanisms. Fiji’s other national policies such as the National Climate Change Policy, the National Adaptation Plan and the Fiji Low Emission Development Strategy and various other sector policies including but not limited to education, health and agriculture place clear emphasis on the global goals and its achievement 


primarily through the government machinery. 
Achieving the SDGs therefore is a complex and systematic endeavour and requires the involvement of a wide range of stakeholders from different backgrounds in the process thus creating a social and institutional partnership as well as joint responsibility of public entities, businesses and citizens for the implementation of SDGs. Fiji is a small island country, with limited resources and vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Consequently, international partnership and collaboration are also important for Fiji to achieve its SDGs. To achieve the goals and targets set out in NDPs and SDGs, Fiji also requires significant public investment and private investment to implement the programs set out in its NDP. 
This Voluntary National Review is the first for Fiji and appraises the localisation of the global development agenda and provides a comprehensive update on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and its 17 SDGs. The report is structured according to the 2019 Edition of the Handbook for the Preparation of Voluntary National Reviews prepared by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs.  



Fiji’s VNR is a reflection of our national circumstances and commitments to achieve the 2030 Agenda. It is a comprehensive review of the implementation of the transformative 2030 Agenda and its 17 SDGs. As this VNR is the first national review, its development has been a comprehensive and inclusive exercise, upholding the principle of leaving no one behind. The formal processes started with the receipt of the formal communication from the President of the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) in March 2018 confirming Fiji’s intention to present its VNR at the 2019 high-level political forum (HLPF) on sustainable development when it would be convened under the auspices of the ECOSOC in 2019.
The Ministry of Economy, the central government agency responsible for national development planning and thus the sustainable development agenda led the development of the VNR. The Ministry is also the convener of the SDGs Taskforce that is charged with the important responsibility of overseeing SDGs implementation in the country. 
The development of VNR started with a detailed data and information review exercise, followed by a comprehensive and inclusive stakeholder consultation process via various platforms.
a) Baseline Data Collection and Assessment 
As we have learnt from the Millennium Development Goals monitoring process, data paucity affects the quality of national reports.  With the support of the United Nations Development Programme, we started the comprehensive data collection process in mid2018 with the intention to build a SDGs baseline database so as to establish the SDG baseline status in Fiji, to establish a SDGs M&E system and to enable SDGs M&E. The basis of this work was the SDGs global indicator framework prepared by the InterAgency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators, which includes 232 SDGs global indicators, and the SDGs Pacific Indicator framework developed by the Pacific SDGs Taskforce as part of the Pacific Roadmap for Sustainable Development that includes 132 Pacific Sustainable Development Indicators. 
The baseline data collection work involved baseline data collection and baseline data assessment through desktop review of both qualitative and quantitative secondary data available within Government agencies, non-Government organizations (NGOs), and academia, and 

consultation with government agencies and NGOs. The exercise revealed serious lack of data for SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), SDG 12 (Sustainable Consumption and Production), SDG 13 (Climate Action) and SDG 14 (Life Below Water) and explored proxy national indicators for these SDGs. The assessment also highlighted the indicators that have been mainstreamed into the 5-Year and 20-Year NDP and suggested a number of indicators that needed to be adapted to the Fijian context. This exercise also helped identify a number of indicators that are not relevant for Fiji.
b) Stakeholder Consultations 
Fiji’s VNR processes have benefitted from a comprehensive and inclusive national stakeholder consultation, culminated with a number of national events and gatherings. These include: 
	i. 	High-Level Briefing Session on the VNR
A high-level briefing session on the VNR was convened by the Ministry of Economy in November 2018 with the objective of informing Government agencies of the review process and seeking strategic inputs on the preparation of the VNR. The session was attended by the Speaker of Parliament and the United Nations Resident Coordinator and served as a useful strategy building session for the development of Fiji’s VNR. This was also an important wholeof-Government awareness process as the Ministry officials commenced the drafting of the core chapters of the VNR, which from past experience requires frequent linking back with implementing agencies in Government.   ii. Call for Submissions 
The Fijian Government issued a call for submission from the private sector, nongovernment organisations, civil society organisations, academia and philanthropy on programmes or initiatives that are being implemented by these stakeholders to support the achievement of SDGs as well as their perceptions on SDG implementation in Fiji. The call for submission allowed private stakeholders the opportunity to provide detailed information on SDG related projects that demonstrate their commitment to implementing the SDGs. 
iii. Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action – Fiji Progress Report  


To market the 25th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women and the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the Fijian Government conducted a comprehensive national review towards this universal commitment to women and girls. The review process involved a wide array of stakeholders. The resultant progress report has provided useful information on the implementation of SDG 5 (Gender Equality) and SDG 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions). 
iv. Civil Society Organisation SDGs Forum  
The Fiji Civil Society Organisation (CSO) Voluntary Review Taskforce organised a twoday forum to assess and report on CSOs contributions to the implementation of SDGs since 2015.The taskforce comprises  NGOs such as the Fiji Council of Social Services, Fiji Women’s Rights Movement, Fiji Disabled People’s Forum, Citizens Constitutional Forum, Fiji Commerce and Employers Federation, Save the Children Fiji, ADRA Fiji, Haus of Khameleon, Rainbow Pride Foundation, Pacific Centre for Peacebuilding, Habitat for Humanity Fiji and the Pacific Islands Association of NGOs. The outcome of the CSOs Forum has been integrated into Fiji’s VNR. 
v. National Poverty Forum 
The Fijian Government also convened a National Poverty Forum with the theme of leaving no one behind. Recognizing the multi-dimensional nature of poverty, the Forum provided useful input for the articulation of Fiji’s progress on SDG 1 (No Poverty) and a number of other SDGs. vi. SDGs Taskforce Meeting 
The SDGs Taskforce served as an important validation platform for the draft VNR. Over 90 participants from Government, NGOs, CSOs, faith-based organisations and academia participated in the review and validation process providing overall guidance on the key messages captured in the draft report. The feedback from the SDGs Taskforce meeting was critical in finalizing the VNR. 
c) VNR Development and Submission  
The VNR report has been developed by the team from the Ministry of Economy based on SDG baseline data assessment and consultation with national stakeholders. As a nationally owned process, the VNR development has gone through several iterations to ensure the feedback and inputs from stakeholders have been appropriately captured. The Ministry of Economy also led the development of a short video for presentation at the 2019 HLPF. 



a) Creating Ownership of the Sustainable Development Goals 
Fiji recognises the transformative and the development ambition of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and considers that the 2030 Agenda, taken together with the Paris Agreement, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, provides a framework for achieving a sustainable, prosperous and peaceful future for the world and its peoples. While the SDGs represent a global response to global challenges, Fiji considers them to be nationally relevant and capable of having a transformative impact on the quality of life of all Fijians. The integration of the SDGs in the three arms of the State – the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary is the pinnacle of SDGs ownership and localisation. Within this framework of integration, work programmes and projects are carried out that involves various stakeholders.     
b) Incorporation of the SDGs in National Frameworks
The sustainable development principles underpinning the SDGs have long been the underlying principles for Fiji’s national development. In implementing the SDGs, Fiji has adopted a ‘wholeof-Government’ approach and has utilized national development planning as the primary instrument to drive forward SDGs implementation. 
In 2017, The Fijian Government launched its 5-Year & 20-Year National Development Plan (NDP) with the vision of transforming Fiji. The NDP proposes two mutually inclusive and mutually reinforcing development strategies:
• Inclusive Social-Economic Development - aiming to further improve the living standards of Fijians; and 
• Transformational Strategic Thrusts - aiming to build Fiji as a modern regional hub of the South Pacific through continuing the momentum of key reforms and building on existing locational, infrastructure, and institutional advantages. 
The NDP is the outcome of a nationwide consultation process that involved the private sector, civil society, community groups, government and the general public reflecting the aspirations of the Fijian people and their Government’s commitment for a transformed Fiji.
Mainstreamed and integrated within the various thematic areas of the NDP are the 17 SDGs – 15 of which are explicitly integrated into the corresponding 29 strategic priorities of the NDP while SDG 10 (reduce inequalities), SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and SDG 13 (climate action) are treated as crosscutting issues across the NDP. Consequently, the SDG implementation and its monitoring hinge on the NDP processes including the overall monitoring and evaluation.  
At the sector level, SDGs have already been integrated into sectoral strategic plans and policies in many sectors including but not limited to education, health and agriculture. Fiji also recognises that, while Government holds the important responsibility for achieving the SDGs, it is in everyone’s interest and everyone’s responsibility including private individuals, private enterprises, NGOs and CSOs to advance the sustainable development agenda. Working with these multiple stakeholders, the Fijian Government is helping advance socio-economic development and empowerment of all Fijians.






c) Integration of the Three Dimensions 
The Fijian Government recognises that economic development, climate change adaptation and mitigation, disaster risk reduction, and environmental protection objectives are deeply inter-woven and that without increased effort to address these linkages, trade-offs will become increasingly difficult to manage. An intergovernmental approach to development drawn from the understanding that national resilience can only be improved if the relationship and dependencies between social dynamics, environmental hazards, economic risks, development impacts, climate changes, and sectors are addressed and considered in a holistic way. This calls for a reform of systems, increased connectivity and collaboration between a wide range of stakeholders, improved capability for strategic foresight and evidence-based decision making, and an increased emphasis on common objectives and interests over sectors. This is underlying principle of the Fijian Green Growth Framework and the National Development Plan that recognise the need for action at all levels, to strengthen the environmental resilience, drive social improvement and reduce poverty, enhance economic growth and also build capacity to withstand and manage the anticipated adverse effects of climate change.
Fiji’s National Change Policy (NCCP) further deploys a strategic approach to achieving the interwoven and inter-dependant SDGs. For example, in Fiji’s case, vulnerability to climate change has the potential to derail and undermine progress against each of the SDGs. Thus the NCCP approaches the SDGs through the lens of SDG13 and the woven approach helps to provide insight into the relationships between the SDGs recognising that global and national ambition and commitment to climate action is a key holistic enabler to achieving the SDGs. 
The NCCP recognises that gender equality (SDG 5), strong institutions (SDG 16), partnerships (SDG 17), as well as sustainable physical infrastructure and innovation (SDG 9) are major prerequisites for improving basic services (SDG 1, 2, 4, 6 and 7) and protecting ecosystem integrity (SDG 14 and 15). Actions to deliver against these goals will improve long-term well-being, economic resilience, and sustainability (SDG 3, 8, 11 and 12) which will ultimately enable the reduction of societal inequality (SDG 10). 

d) Leaving No One Behind 
The adoption of the 2030 Agenda by UN Member States in 2015 was a landmark achievement, providing for a shared global vision towards sustainable development for all. The Agenda and its SDGs represent a commitment to eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable development by 2030 world-wide, ensuring that no one is left behind. 
Common Identity 
For Fiji, leaving no one behind is about creating equal opportunity and a common identity and the foundation of equal citizenry and opportunity has been established by the 2013 Constitution by calling every citizen a ‘Fijian’. A common identity and equal citizenry creates a level playing field on which every citizen can excel and facilitates justice, transparency and good governance.
Comprehensive Bill of Rights 
The Bill of Rights of the Fijian Constitution is extremely comprehensive and robust. For the first time in Fijian history, the Constitution actually facilitates the concomitant application of civil and political rights, and social and economic rights. It obligates the State, by law, to advance, protect and progressively realise these fundamental rights for all Fijians. These rights are enforceable through an independent judiciary. 
Leaving no One Behind in Policy Development
In delivering the transformative development agenda through the Government machinery, it is imperative that all stakeholders are consulted in the policy development process. The NDP – apex policy document for the Fijian Government for example has been formulated through an inclusive and consultative process that is unprecedented in Fiji’s modern history. The extensive consultations including over 800 public forums all over Fiji undertaken since 2015, including the two rounds of public consultation, provided a strong platform to receive feedback from ordinary Fijians on where Government’s development focus should be, likewise to validate the plans of Government to ensure it meets the needs and aspirations of all Fijians. Likewise, every year the Fijian Government engages in rounds of public consultations on the preparation of the national budget. The Government believes that it is important to bring every Fijian together in this national conversation so that they can continue to provide their invaluable input for development, growth and prosperity. 
Translating Policy into Sustainable Action 
The Fijian Government has embarked on a wide array of social, economic and infrastructure development programme to ensure economic and social prosperity for all Fijians, particularly those considered vulnerable. The Government’s focus on infrastructure development and modernization plans are seen beneficial not only for better connectivity with the rest of the world but to address deep rooted challenges of isolation from markets and services. Investment in roads, bridges and jetties connect Fijians to markets and opportunities. 
Similarly, the Fijian Government’s free education scheme ensures that all Fijians are given equal opportunities and accessibility to attain education given that a lot of emphasis is placed on an educated society which will in future inject that much needed empowerment, skills and knowledge in all Fijians to progress productively. Policies such as, free education, transport assistance and free text books are some of the reform initiatives to make education accessible. Recognising the importance of technical and vocational education and to meet the demands of a changing labour market as well as to address unemployment, the Fijian Government has undertaken substantive investment in technical colleges since 2015. These opportunities will allow young Fijians to become job creators. 
Addressing Discrimination Against Women and Girls 
While some forms of discrimination against women and girls in Fiji have improved over the years, varying forms of gender inequality and the existence of systemic and structural barriers continues to hold many women and girls back, depriving them of basic rights and opportunities, including participation of women in decision making spheres. The prevalence of patriarchal and heteronormative values, emphasis on gender roles, and discrimination faced by marginalised women is an impediment to recognising women’s economic worth thus affecting their empowerment and development.  
Drawing attention to Fiji’s commitments to the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), the Fiji National Gender Policy, the Fijian Constitution as well as other human rights commitments that Fiji has pledged to, collaborative work is underway between Fiji Women’s Rights Movement (FWRM) and the Fiji Courts, Office of the Director of the Public Prosecution, Fiji Police Force and the Legal Aid Commission in publishing sex desegregated data. The FWRM has done further analytical work to include violence against women and children cases from the years 2006 to 2018 that reflects a much larger problem of entrenched patriarchal norms that affect women and girls’ participation and perception in society, and increase vulnerability in situations of violence and accessing justice. To ensure that there is parallel and continued efforts to educate the people of Fiji on gender equality, human rights, the law and services provided when violence is experienced, FWRM is presently working with a wide range of community organisations to strengthen community awareness sessions.
Comprehensive Social Protection Coverage 
Poverty has steadily declined in Fiji, with extreme poverty now rare. The social protection initiatives and safety nets of the Fijian Government play an important role in providing assistance to vulnerable population to meet their basic needs. Transformative interventions such as the free water, electricity, education, and medicine and health services lighten the burden of many Fijians. Likewise, the main social protection programs such as the Poverty Benefit Scheme, Care and Protection Allowance and Social Pension Scheme all inbuilt with a food voucher and free bus fare programme constitute an effective response to the most vulnerable which include children living in poverty, children in orphanages and foster care, people with disabilities and special needs, and the elderly. The Fijian Government also has a functioning food voucher program for rural pregnant women. 
Disability Inclusive Development 
An area of work that truly reflects the Fijian Government’s pledge to leave no one behind is programmes and policies for Fijians living with disabilities. In 2017, the Fiji ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities following which the Parliament enacted a domestic law in the form of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2018 that further clarifies and mandates legal obligations pertaining to the rights of persons living with disabilities in Fiji. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2018 has now expanded on Section 42 of the Fijian Constitution to reflect international obligations under the Convention on the Rights of Persons living with Disabilities making Fiji one of only two Pacific countries with comprehensive legislation for Persons with Disabilities.
For persons living with disabilities, a key component of their welfare is caregiving. To enhance the capacities of individuals and families to take care of persons living with disabilities within their families and within their communities, the Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation has partnered with Australia Pacific Training Coalition to carry out caregiving skills trainings in communities. So far, 285 Fijians have been trained. This community training will continue as part of the community empowerment programme for the welfare and care of the elderly and those living with disabilities.
Other initiatives funded by Fijian Government that has empowered persons living with disabilities include disability monthly allowance programme, economic empowerment programme, grants to organisations which provide services to persons living with disabilities, 20 fulltime scholarships for students with disabilities, annual budgetary allowance for the Fiji National Council for Disabled Persons, a 300 percent tax incentive for employers who employ persons living with disabilities, funding allocation for making Fijian buildings disability friendly and prioritising areas of training like Speech Therapy, Educational and Clinical Psychology and Occupational Therapy in the national toppers scholarships scheme. 
There is also a clear commitment under the 
Pacific Framework for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities to produce disability disaggregated data in a comparable manner through the use of the Washington Group Short Set (WGSS) of Questions in censuses and surveys. Fiji included the WGSS in its last census round to generate valuable data that will contribute to better inform policy and programmes on disability. 
Addressing the Climate Injustice 
The impacts climate change has on small island developing nations like Fiji are vast and far reaching. Despite its economic status, vulnerability and size, Fiji is in the forefront of global climate action. In 2017, Fiji assumed chairmanship of international climate negotiations and used this global platform to shed light on the realities of climate change faced by many small island developing states. Since then, Fiji has continued to be a global advocate for climate action. Fiji’s global leadership is built on its regional and local commitment to address climate change. In Fiji, slow on set events like rising sea-levels have encroached on low-lying maritime communities, resulting in surging tides that threaten crops and livelihoods. This has resulted in the growing need to relocate affected coastal communities and settlements to safer areas. Although Fiji’s global greenhouse gas emissions is negligible and it has not contributed towards the change in climate system, the Fijian Government is allocating national resources, developing policies/plans and taking steps to ensure that relocation efforts undertaken at all levels are sustainable, promotes human rights and dignity and safeguards the interests of all involved.  
Bridging the Digital Divide 
ICTs are increasingly pervasive. They bring new opportunities and tremendous impacts on improving the lives of people hence will be essential to realising the SDGs. ICTs are relevant to the developing world as an enabler of social development and good governance and a driver of economic and productivity growth.  
The Fijian Government was the first in the Pacific to implement its broadband policy, under which there has been an exponential growth of ICT services, particularly mobile broadband with the penetration of ICT services well above 95% of the population. Fiji is also the first Pacific island state to auction of 4G spectrums and is also making significant progress in the areas of broadcasting, with the country switching on its first Digital Television transmitters in September 2016, with nationwide rollout of digital TV completed by end of 2017. 
In 2018, the Fijian Government also commissioned a submarine cable project that will increase connectivity speeds on Vanua Levu (Fiji’s second major island) by fifty times, from two gigabits to 100 gigabits per second across the island. The faster Internet speed, amongst other things means schools will have the ability to engage in digital learning in an entirely new way - it will bring more students online to engage with their classmates and the rest of their nation and it will create a vital link of reliable communication for those students and teachers in the most remote parts of the North.
e) Institutional Mechanisms 
Fijian Parliament and the Sustainable Development Goals
Legislatures have an essential role in representing citizens, enacting laws and adopting budgets, as well as in ensuring accountability of the effective 
for its action, including in its capacity to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In 

recent years, the Fijian Parliament has expanded its role and initiated activities to strengthen its support towards the promotion, implementation and monitoring of the SDGs. Beginning in 2016, the Parliament has undertaken initiatives promoting and ensuring progress of the implementation of the SDGs. These include amongst other activities, capacity‐building exercises of Members and staff, development of a gender analysis toolkit and the promotion of the SDGs with the public through the “Speaker’s Debates”. The Parliament is also closely engaging with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP, through its Fiji Parliament Support Project) and the Inter‐Parliamentary Union (IPU) for support towards mainstreaming the SDGs and conducting capacity‐building for Members of Parliament to strengthen their role of oversight of the Executive in the implementation of the goals. 
In May 2019, the Fijian Parliament and partners launched a Guidance Note1 on integrating the SDGs across the work of all Fijian Parliament committees. The document features concrete, tangible actions that committees can take to improve oversight of the SDGs. Titled, ‘Oversight of the Implementation of the SDGs: Guidance Note for the Standing Committees of the Parliament of the Republic of Fiji,’ the Note aims to assist committees in engaging effectively with the SDGs in all of their work. The document emphasizes the importance of the SDG indicators, and describes how the committees can use these indicators to track progress toward the SDG targets as well as the targets of Fiji’s National Development Plan (NDP). The Note shares methods and tools for committees to use in order to improve their oversight role in monitoring SDG progress and the NDP, such as engaging civil society, conducting site visits, engaging the government and conducting enquiries. The Guidance Note also features a series of checklists, sample questions and step-by-step guides to support the committee’s efforts. Case studies share lessons learned from other countries’ SDG oversight.
The Guidance Note identifies key entry points for Fiji’s Parliament to engage in implementation and oversight of the SDGs, including by scrutinizing bills, annual reports and expenditures through an SDG lens. For example, the document explains how a Standing Committee to which a bill has been referred can assess whether the bill is in compliance with the SDGs. This would offer an opportunity to bring domestic laws and policies into alignment with the SDGs. The Note provides a step-by-step guide to help parliamentarians scrutinize annual reports, including a list of proposed actions and guiding questions. Similarly, Standing Committees can use annual sectoral reports submitted by line ministries to Parliament to assess whether, how and to what extent programmes and policies of government have contributed to achieving the SDGs over the past year, and conduct a review of SDG outcomes delivered in each portfolio area.
The aim of this Guidance Note is to assist Committees in making the SDGs central to the work of the Parliament and in engaging effectively with the SDGs in all areas of Committee work. The Guidance Note starts with an overview of the SDGs and 2030 Agenda and why they are relevant to the Parliament of Fiji and its Committees. It offers practical guidance regarding specific entry points to proactively engage in the implementation and oversight of the SDGs and discusses specific methods, tools and innovative approaches that can be used by the Committees to actively monitor SDG implementation; including through the examination of SDG and NDP indicators that have been categorised according to the remits of the Standing Committees. Moreover, the Guidance Note includes a series of sample questions, checklists, case studies, step-by-step guides, examples of international case studies and a selection of useful resources.
Fijian Government and the Sustainable Development Goals
Fiji’s 5-Year & 20-Year National Development Plan with the vision of transforming Fiji is the apex document for mainstreaming SDGs and its implementation through the various agencies of Government. Critical cross-cutting issues such as climate change, green growth, the environment, gender equality, disability and governance are mainstreamed in the NDP. Thus the implementation of the SDGs is mainly driven through the national planning processes with Ministry of Economy taking the overall SDGs coordination and implementation role in Government. 
As the first country to have ratified the Paris Agreement on climate change, Fiji fully recognises the need to take a proactive role in addressing climate risks through adaptation and investment in resilience. It holds the view that the inability to take action on climate will affect the nation’s ability to achieve the SDGs. Consequently, Fiji is one of the few countries in the world where the climate change division is embedded in a central agency—Ministry of Economy—that has the national development policy, budgeting and finance mandate. This institutional realignment within the Fijian Government soon after the adoption of the 2030 Agenda and its SDGs in 2015 is the bedrock for promoting sustainable and climate resilient development through national policy and fiscal measures. 
Another major institutional setup is the new Ministry of Waterways that has been established by the Government to address the growing threat that flooding poses to Fijian communities, a threat that is projected to worsen due to the effects of climate change. Fiji is proud to have assumed global leadership on two important SDGs - SDG 13 (climate action) and SDG 14 (life under water) as co-host of the United Nations Ocean Conference in 2017 and assuming the Presidency of the 23rd Conference of Parties (COP23) also in 2017, reflecting the climatecentered focus of the Fijian Government. 
Judiciary as an Enabler of the Sustainable Development Goals
Rule of law is considered to be an enabler for the realisation of the other SDGs. Judicial intervention is anticipated in areas where the States will apply policy and legislative interventions to address challenges and where Agenda 2030 has directly placed on States the obligation to meet targets premised in the law. Therefore as an enabler of sustainable development, rule of law is the hub and the other 15 SDGs are the spokes in the network. In the Fijian context, the Judiciary promotes and enlivens through its decision making processes the non-discriminatory provisions of the 2013 Constitution. Furthermore, the Judiciary is an equal opportunity employer which recruits only based on merit and has had an increase in the number of female judicial officers and support staff. 
The Fijian Judiciary’s commitment to SDG 10 is demonstrated through its decentralization efforts with the Court traveling to rural and maritime areas to adjudicate upon matters. Apart from decentralisation, the Judiciary actively participates in community outreach programmes whereby staff attend to Tikina council, women’s group and rural community meetings and educate people on the role of the Judiciary and the legal avenues available including but not limited to Domestic Violence Restraining Orders and the roles of the Small Claims Tribunal. Whenever environmental issues (climate change, oceans, forestry and biodiversity) are brought before the attention of the Court by way of civil applications or criminal charges, the matters are dealt with urgency.
As regards SDG 16 on peace, justice and strong institutions, the Fijian Judiciary strongly safeguards its independence and impartiality. Under the 2013 Constitution not only does the Judiciary have independence from the other arms of the State but it also has financial autonomy. As part of its own processes in order to provide an effective and efficient process, the Judiciary has implemented its own case management processes whereby 
Courts try to dispose of cases within a time period. The Judicial officers and support staff actively participate in trainings both locally and abroad to broaden their skill-sets and promote the efficiency of the Courts in line with international standards. The Courts promote accessibility to Justice and in a bid to empower access by even the marginalised members of society all fees payable by Legal Aid represented litigants are waived. The Judiciary has also established a Mediation Centre whereby people have an opportunity to resolve their disputes through Alternative Dispute Resolution processes. 
f) Structural Issues The challenges encountered in implementing programmes/projects compound onto another causing the inability to reach programme/project or national targets. The first and foremost challenge for project implementation for sustainability, resilience and durability is the inability to identify sustainability concepts and how this can be incorporated in the overall project design. This is partly due to inadequate institutional capacity or trained personnel to plan and implement projects effectively. 
The remoteness of islands and maritime communities poses development challenge as well. From facing traditional exclusion and access issues, some of these communities now face the challenges of sea level rise and coastal inundation. 
In addition to the challenge of capacity, resources, access including technology for implementation, it is very clear that climate-induced natural disasters pose the biggest challenge to project implementation. It derails progress and often renders countries into the rebuild mode affecting implementation of projects. In 2016 when Fiji experienced category five tropical cyclone the entire Fijian economy was affected. Given the major focus of the Fijian Government on infrastructure development, most infrastructure projects were delayed or put on hold given the massive rebuild efforts that had to be deployed to ensure essential services like health centres and educational facilities continue to operate. 
Limited fiscal manoeuvres, especially in relation to public sector projects are a challenge. For instance, making a traditional infrastructure development project into a climate resilient one will include revisiting the overall project design and deploying resources and technology that is able to withstand climate adversities. Building back better after climate-induced natural disasters and investing in resilience is often a costly exercise and one that often results in debt accumulation for economies like Fiji that have a limited fiscal base.
Notwithstanding these challenges, significant efforts are underway in addressing the myriad development challenges. From developing innovative national policy instruments to exploring market-based financial solutions to improving service delivery of public institutions, the Fijian Government remains committed to transforming Fiji based on the aspirations of the NDP and in close collaboration with all stakeholders.    



SDG 1: No Poverty
End poverty in all its forms everywhere

Current Status and Trends
As Fiji continues to progress on a development trajectory that is consistent with its 5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan, significant advancements have been made to reduce national poverty and create an inclusive, equitable and pro-poor society.
Eradicating poverty is at the heart of Fiji’s national development ambitions as we remain steadfast on reducing national incidence of poverty to 10% by 2036. Given that half of Fiji’s population is below the age of 27, 69 percent below the age of 40 and 13.7 percent have a functioning disability, significant emphasis has been placed on creating youth employment and providing equitable social opportunities for females and people living with disabilities. Poverty in Fiji is defined by the National Basic Needs Poverty Line.2 
Fiji is in its 10th Year of consecutive economic growth underpinned by transformative state-led investments in resilient infrastructure development, information communication & technology, and service sector development coupled with modern economic, legal and educational reforms to create greater opportunities and a more level playing field for all Fijians. Employment creation has been a hallmark of this sustained economic progress as expansionary fiscal policies3 have created decent jobs, encouraged entrepreneurship and mainstreamed technical and   vocational learning, particularly amongst a growing youth population. As a result, national unemployment rate has reduced from 8.6 percent in 2007 to 4.5 percent in 2017, the lowest in 20 years in combination with reduced income inequality4 indicating that Fiji’s economic prosperity has resulted in equitable benefits for all Fijians.

Fiji has continued to take an inclusive approach to national development. Comprehensive social assistance programmes are helping provide social protection for the poor, disadvantaged and vulnerable groups, for those who have been affected by climate related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental adversities. Core social assistance programs include the Poverty Benefit Scheme (PBS) providing grant assistance to the poorest 10% of households, the Social Pension Scheme (SPS) providing grant assistance to senior citizens of ages 
65 and above, the Care and Protection Allowance (CPA) 
Core Social Assistance Programmes Coverage

providing grant for welfare of children living in vulnerable social circumstances, the Food Voucher Programme (FVP) providing grants to rural pregnant mothers and the Bus Fare Programme (BFP) providing subsidised bus fare for senior citizens and free bus service for the disabled. These programmes provide targeted assistance to vulnerable segments of society. Between 2014-2015 and 2018-2019, total number of beneficiaries covered by the core social assistance programmes increased from 122,696 to 170,835 which now accounts for 19.3% of Fiji’s population. National Budget allocation for these social assistance programmes also increased from FJ $32.4 million to FJ $96.4 million over the same period. These welfare assistance programmes were scaled up to provide socio-economic support to near marginalised Fijians who are on the verge of falling into the poverty trap and need state assistance to help them avoid doing so. This proactive emphasis on enhancing social protection is also coupled with various welfare to workfare programmes administered by NGOs and development partners to prevent continued dependence on social welfare.
Over the past decade, Fiji has placed significant emphasis on improving affordability and accessibility of health and education services. A healthy and educated society will have the necessary prerequisites to actively participate in the workforce, improve its standard of living, and ultimately contribute to national development.     
A holistic approach to socio-economic development through combined efforts of state and non-state stakeholders has seen a steady decline in national poverty from 35 percent in 2002-2003 to 28. 1 percent in 2013-2014). Economic growth remains strong, approximately 8,000 jobs are created every year, proactive social welfare coverage is expanding, affordable health and education coverage is increasing 
Fiji’s National, Urban and Rural Poverty Rate

and state investments in access to basic infrastructure and housing is strong. It is expected that improved standards of living, improved income inequality and further reduction of poverty will be reflected in the upcoming 2019-2020 Household Income and 
Expenditure Survey.   
Gaps and Challenges
Despite national poverty continuing to decrease, rural poverty remains higher than the national average. Economic opportunities continue to be limited in rural parts of Fiji relative to urban centres. In this regard, rural urban drift remains high as the rural unemployed move to urban centres in search of employment and better standards of living. This is perpetuated by the fact that youth unemployment remains high as growing youth population require more job opportunities. 
Female unemployment remains higher than male unemployment despite equal representation in school and tertiary education. Limited participation of women in the workforce can be related to numerous reasons such as social restrictions that prioritise domestic duties and child rearing over workfare, limited opportunities for female centric employment and lower wages compared to men.   
Climate change poses the single greatest threat to Fiji’s national development. Poor and vulnerable Fijians, which include women, the aged and the disabled, are disproportionally affected by the slow and sudden onsets of climate change that harm food security, livelihoods, settlements and human health. It is estimated that erratic climate adversities have the potential to push between 3.1 to 4.1 percent of Fiji’s population into poverty per year.  
Access to affordable, predictable, sustainable and adequate development finance from bilateral, multilateral, and International Financial Institutions remains a major challenge for Fiji. Cumbersome access processes, limited local capacity to develop bankable proposals, country income status and cost of repayments add to Fiji’s domestic financial constraints to address poverty.     
Way Forward
Government and NGOs will need to synergise their work even more to have greater impact on poverty reduction through all segments of society. More needs to be done to accelerate rural poverty reduction and negate further increasing urban poverty. Focus must be on fostering sustained socio-economic development that enables job creation, encourages entrepreneurship and promotes technical and vocational learning. Current investments in ICT to create equal opportunities for those in rural areas must continue and the Youth Entrepreneur Scheme and the Micro, Small & Medium Enterprise Grant Scheme must be scaled up.    
The recently introduced family care and paternal leave and increase in maternity leave are enablers to increase female labour force participation. The great work done by NGOs to promote women led micro and small entrepreneurs must be supported by the Government and greater promotion of women in executive positions is a must, particularly through the Women in Business initiative. Reducing unemployment of women is a low hanging fruit to reduce the national poverty level.       
Health infrastructure and medical technology need continuous improvement to create a healthy working society while the education curriculum must continue to evolve according to employer needs to enable greater labour productivity and sustained economic growth. Over the past three years, the Fijian Government has allocated $3.1 billion for health and education development. 	This 	must 	continue 	with 	greater involvement of non-state actors to enable deep-rooted human capital development.   
Needless to say, all these socio-economic development efforts must have climate resilience built into it. Addressing climate change is an absolute must with a critical need to build community resilience. Country vulnerability should also be a major access criteria used by the global community to allocate funding to small island states like Fiji.  
Welfare to Workfare Through BeekeepingChoosing to protect their forest and forgo logging income, the Drawa Block communities (Drawa, Lutukina, Batiri, Nayarailagi and Vatuvonu) in remote Vanua Levu, Fiji, have developed beekeeping as an alternative livelihood under the Nakau Programme. NZAid support for the implementation of beekeeping as a rural livelihood project provided the commitment for the conservation of their forest resources. The Drawa Block Forest Communities Cooperative (DBFCC) has trained more than 60 beekeepers. The DBFCC now has a business centre and honey storage facility and are caring for 240 double beehives.
The beekeeping communities have sold more than 1.4 tons of honey to DBFCC and have earned an estimated FJ$18,200, which has benefited the community by providing income to fund family and community priorities, such as education and public building maintenance.
As a result of various integrated training in governance and financial management, the DBFCC is regularly reviewing their work plan and benefit sharing system to prioritise business operational expenditure for sustainability. They aim to scale up their pool of honey producers and secure a larger retail market. As part of these plans, they independently applied for other available grants to support their operation, and were successful in attaining a TLTB grant of FJ$5000.Fiji recognises that poverty is a cross cutting matter that stems across all 17 SDGs. In this regard, our holistic approach to reducing poverty entails creating a conducive environment for economic growth and job creation, improving social welfare coverage to help vulnerable groups out of poverty, increasing access to health and education and providing access to water, sanitation, electricity, affordable housing and markets through strategic infrastructure investments. Progress on all these fronts are elaborated on in subsequent chapters of this report.    

SDG 2: Zero Hunger  
and promote sustainable agricultureCurrent Status and Trends
The global indicator framework for SDGs outlines 8 Targets and 13 Indicators for SDG 2. The baseline data collected for SDGs in Fiji revealed the many gaps in availability of data. Highlights of Fiji’s baseline status on nutrition are based on available data on undernourishment, stunting and malnutrition.
Every Fijian has the Constitutional Right to have access to adequate food. To achieve food security in Fiji major focus is placed on domestic agriculture and fisheries. A climate vulnerability study done for Fiji indicated that since 2001 to 2017, cyclones and floods have resulted in a total of FJ$791 million of damages and losses to the agriculture sector alone. Realising that climate change is the single gravest threat to food security for a small island developing state such as Fiji, the climate vulnerability assessment also emphasized the need for investments accumulating to FJ$34 million to strengthen the resilience of the agriculture and fisheries sector in the next 10 years.5 The mobilisation of domestic finance through the national budgets for food security and nutrition has seen to increase form  FJ$50.8 million in the 2016-2017 period, to FJ$117.9 million in the 2017-2018 period and FJ$124.5 million in the period of 2017-2018. 6 Similarly, the total amount of ODA has also increased for the agricultural sector between 2000 and 2016, amounting from FJ$2.06 million in 2000 to FJ$17.1 million in 20167.
The Fijian undernourished population is very minute. However, baseline assessment reveals that it would take Fiji several more years to achieve goal 2. Undernourishment cases, had decreased by 1 % from 5.2 % in 1997 to 4.2 % in 20068. The incidents of undernourishment began to increase from 2006 and stood at 4.6 % in 2016. Data obtained from the Ministry of Health Food and Nutrition Centre on overweight and wasted of children under 5-years for the baseline study conducted for SDGs also revealed a general decrease in the proportions of malnutrition children.  Stunting is an indicator of underweight and is measured by lowheight-for-age. Between 2004 and 2015, the proportion of children under-5 in Fiji who were stunted fell from 
7.5% to 4.9%. 
Gaps and Challenges
It is evident that several indicators for SDG 2 are yet to be fully achieved. There remains a need to strengthen research and development in the areas of agriculture, fisheries and food security ensuring Fijians get adequate and nutritious foods. Monitoring and evaluation systems for existing government initiatives such as providing breakfast for kindergarten and class one students needs to be reviewed and revaluated to measure the trade-offs with SDG 12.
While under nutrition and micronutrient deficiencies continue to persist, prevalence of overweight, obesity and related non-communicable diseases are on the rise. The World Health Organisation in 2016 revealed that 84 % of deaths in Fiji occurred due to Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs). This was the highest recorded for any Pacific Island nation.  Fiji further needs to reevaluate how malnutrition and obesity is addressed both in terms of planning and capacity implementation, while emphasising the interplay and key role of agriculture, health, education, trade and other sectors.
Challenges continue to exist at addressing SDG 2 through a multi-sectoral approach into national policies and programmes to allow for enhanced nutrition and food security, boost people’s resilience to food crises and help increase agricultural growth. The CSOs Forum outcomes revealed that there has been very little direct emphasis placed on SDG 2 in Fiji. SDG 2 has direct synergies with SDGs 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 17. Submissions obtained from the digital call for submission on SDGs highlighted that several projects on resilience and development of agricultural and fisheries sectors. 
There is increasing efforts to promote Fijian Made and 
EU-ADRA-FAO Pro-Resilient Fiji

To help address the impact of drought on rural communities in Fiji, the European Union launched two projects in January 2018. The EU in partnership with Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA) and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations will work in different communities in the Western and Northern divisions of Fiji to cope and become more resilient to future El Niño events.
 The Vakarau-Wai Fiji Pro Resilience Project, headed by ADRA is worth FJD 4.5M and focuses in improving capacity of 150 local communities on drought adaptation and food security. Since El Nino events are now becoming a more frequent phenomenon, this project involves strengthening environmentally sustainable adaptation mechanisms among 10,000 subsistence farmers including women to reduce the negative impacts of El Nino. 
A total of 35,000 households in the two provinces (20 districts and 70 villages in Ba Province and 11 districts and 80 villages in Macuata province) are expected to benefit from this project. 
 The Pro-Resilient Fiji project worth FJD 7M is implemented by FAO. Specifically, the project will focus on improving the resilience of vulnerable households located in the provinces of Ra and Nadroga (Western Division) and Bua (Northern Division). About 10 000 crop and livestock farmers are expected to benefit from climate-smart and nutrition-sensitive agriculture production and conservation methods, including seed and seedling raising, soil protection and management, rehabilitation of degraded lands, integrated pest and disease management, planting diverse nutritious crops in home gardens and the use of agroforestry. 
 In addition, 150 staff and volunteers from Ministry of Agriculture (MoA), National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) and Food Security and Livelihood Cluster (FSLC) will benefit from a capacity building training in conducting vulnerability and risk assessment, post-disaster needs assessments, drought DRM, and information management (IM).Fijian Grown produce. However, to achieve food security, there is a crucial need to improve efficiency at farm level which ultimately contributes to low commodity pricing in the market as well as the need to improve market arrangements for primary agriculture and fisheries produce. To ease this process, the need to establish an efficient system for collecting and disseminating market information becomes significant.
Way Forward
Fiji’s development plans provide several opportunities to address SDG 2. The development of a national food and nutrition security policy is currently underway. This policy will aim to create an enabling environment for agriculture and nutrition nexus. It will conduct periodic joint agriculture and fisheries census surveys and also strengthen statistics and information through the development of a Domestic Food Production Database (agriculture and fisheries) as well as through the existing Food Balance Sheet and National Nutrition Survey.9
In the next five years, the agriculture sector has key interventions to increase production of commodities under bilateral quarantine agreements (eggplant, okra, pawpaw, chillies, and breadfruit), as well as rice, taro, cassava, fruits and vegetables, kava, organic products, livestock and dairy products. Mechanisation and new technologies will be adopted through government support and through private sector partnerships in areas of hydroponics, livestock and dairy, organic farming, and processing of agricultural products (ginger, rice, fresh fruits and vegetables) and fruit drinks. 
To address food security in the fisheries sector, the government is endeavouring to address several sector development challenges, including falling fish stocks, slow growth in aquaculture, additionally finding ways to add value to fisheries resources, and limit the negative effects of climate change. The National Fisheries Policy that will be finalised soon will guide the management and development of sustainable fisheries within the offshore, inshore, coastal and aquaculture subsectors. Government targets to sustainably manage the benefits from offshore fisheries resources, support inshore/coastal fisheries through sustainable fisheries management and development and support growth of the aquaculture industry.


Pacific Island Food Revolution Case Study: potential impact within the nutrition and agricultural sector
Pacific Island Food Revolution (PIFR) is an innovative, multi-media based intervention using the power of reality TV, print and social media to change people’s eating behaviour. Developed by celebrity chef Robert Oliver, PIFR aims to activate local cuisine knowledge and excite people into eating nutritious and healthy food. The Revolution uses a strength-based approach, turning a mirror on the Pacific itself to reveal that eating fresh, local, indigenous food in the correct portions is part of the answer to good health. Thus, PIFR has the potential to contribute to reducing the risk of non-communicable diseases, by promoting healthier diets for Pacific Islanders. 
The innovative nature of PIFR and its far-reaching impact, places the Revolution in a unique position in that it has the potential to play a role in the agricultural value chain. By driving the demand of local produce through engagement with Pacific consumers, then while allowing the market to respond with increased production, PIFR aims to work with partners to elevate and support supply activities and food security initiatives.
By celebrating Pacific Cuisine across multiple communications platforms, PIFR aims to nudge consumer social and behavioural norms, in turn, driving market demand for fresh, local and nutritious food. The Project is taking an innovative approach to measuring the potential impacts of the Revolution through its adaptive monitoring, evaluation and learning strategy. To date, potential impacts have been measured through four mechanisms: a lab experiment, baseline survey, anecdotally through social media and internal monitoring and pivoting in real-time.
A lab based behavioural experiment, undertaken in partnership with USP’s Institute of Applied Sciences and Busara Centre for Behavioural Economics was commissioned to test any early signs of impact after watching the TV show. The results were positive, particularly the impacts on women, closing an observed gender gap in healthy eating between men and women. Watching the PIFR video increases the probability that women choose the healthy Pacific option by 146%. We have had people write to us and say they are now choosing local food over imported food such as noodles. It is still early, but what we might predict in the short term is an increase of local food demand of the market system.
Current Status and Trends 
The 2013 Constitution of the Republic of Fiji lays down the nations’ commitment to good health and well-being. The National Development Plan (NDP) has explicitly integrated many SDG 3 targets and indicators, and has listed the following national targets:
• reducing maternal mortality ratio to less than 39.2 or less than 8 deaths by 2021;
• reducing perinatal mortality rate to less than 9 per 1,000 total births by 2030;
• reducing infant mortality rate to less than 8 per 1,000 live births by 2030;
• reducing under 5 mortality rate to less than 8 per 1,000 live births by 2030;
• reducing neonatal mortality to less than 5 by 2021;
• reducing the prevalence rate of tuberculosis to less than 77 per 100,000 population by 2021;
• reducing the total number of confirmed HIV cases to less than 900 by 2021;
• reducing the premature mortality due to noncommunicable diseases (NCDs)  (<70 years) to less than 20% by 2030; and
• reducing the prevalence of diabetes to less than 30% by 2030.
The NDP proposes to achieve these targets through strengthening and implementing integrated programmes for maternal and child health, expanding the immunization programme, strengthening the integrated management of childhood illnesses, and improving reproductive health.
At sectoral level, the Ministry of Health and Medical 
Services (MoHMS) has developed the National Strategic Plan for 2016-2020, which have identified reducing the risks of NCDs, improving maternal, child, and reducing communicable diseases as priority areas for its first strategic pillar of delivering health services to the population. The second strategic pillar is to strengthen health systems, including expanded primary health 
care, to motivate health workforce and improve their productivity, to raise the standard of evidence-based policy, planning, implementation and assessment, to develop health infrastructure, and to ensure sustainable financing. For some of the priority areas, MoHMS has developed targeted strategic plans, including National Wellness Policy, NCDs Strategic Plan, and Climate Change and Health Strategic Action Plan.
Fiji’s health care services are delivered through its wellestablished health system, based on quality primary care. The three-tier structure provides integrated services at primary, secondary and tertiary levels, and includes government, private and traditional care providers. The MoHMS is responsible for developing health policies and managing the overall system. Primary and public health are administered through four Divisional level offices, which in turn are broken down into 19 subdivisions. Actual health care services are provided through a hierarchy of nursing stations, health centres, sub-divisional hospitals, divisional hospitals and specialist hospitals. Divisional hospitals provide tertiary care and also function as national domestic referral centres.
Fiji, until end of 2017, has fully achieved the global maternal mortality ratio of less than 70 per 100,000 live births. The maternal mortality ratio has reduced from 59.47 per 100,000 live births in 2012 to 35.6 in 201710. However, the trend in figures over the years still indicate that there is need to create more awareness on maternal child health care and tackling issues that would help reduce maternal mortality. 
Perinatal and neonatal deaths contribute substantially to the infant and under-5 mortalities in Fiji. While countries globally are aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12 per 1,000 live births and under-5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births, significant progress has been made in Fiji in the recent years to prevent deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age. Nevertheless, findings indicate that not much progress has been made over the last decade to further improve the infant and under-5 mortality rates. Fiji’s infant mortality rate stands at 16.4 per 1,000 live births in 2017 compared to 15.9 per 1,000 live births in 2012. The under-5 mortality rate stands at 20.8 per 1,000 live births in 2017 compared to 21.0 per 1,000 live births in 2012. This stagnation in indicators implies that more efforts are necessary to improve the quality of antenatal and perinatal services.
Gaps and Challenges
A growing concern contributing to the substantial share of disease and mortalities in Fiji is premature mortality resulting from NCDs. On this front there has been minimal progress with the NCDs burden continuing to demand significant health resources. There has been an increase in confirmed cardiovascular cases but this may be partly due to improved diagnostics, referrals, and cardiovascular interventions such as angiograms. Admissions for cardiovascular diseases have increased from 35 per 1000 admissions in 2013 to 59 in 2017 and a leading cause for this is Rheumatic heart disease. Mortality due to Diabetes has also decreased but Cancer mortality has increased. Overall the number of mortality relating to cardiovascular, cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory disease has reduced from 4,455 in 2012 to 4,120 in 2017.
Diabetes continues to be a main factor in the increase in number of patients seeking dialysis treatment. Fiji has invested in the purchase of supplies for dialysis machines at three dialysis centers located at the main divisional hospitals: CWM, Lautoka and Labasa. These services are provided to patients in our public hospitals and, in keeping with all other publicly-funded health services are allocated in line with clinical needs and patients’ ability to benefit.
Poor nutrition is also a contributing factor to increasing NCDs. There are current efforts on preventive health care by promoting healthy eating habits, physical activity and other lifestyle changes in schools and in communities to reduce NCDs.
In terms of communicable diseases, Pneumonia and Leptospirosis account for the greatest number of deaths in Fiji. TB case notifications have increased over the last 5yrs from 201 in 2012 to 363 in 2017. This increase is also partly a result of improved case detection rate and increased efforts in TB programs. The current incidence rate for Fiji is 49 per 100,000. At the end of 2018, a total of 927 cases of HIV have been reported. The UNAIDS’s Fiji Country snapshot report in 2016 find that only 259 people of the confirmed HIV cases were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) treatment. The incidence of Hepatitis B has shown a reduction from 37.41 per 100,000 population in 2014 compared to 12.5 in 2017. In Fiji, Hepatitis B immunizations are part of Fiji’s immunization schedule for infants under 18 months which are free and available to all new births in Fiji. 
Frequent infectious disease outbreaks have been reported with some pathogens showing multi-drug resistance hence limiting the access to effective antimicrobials treatment for patients. Fiji is also taking a holistic and multi-sectoral approach to address the emergence of multi-drug resistance to ensure the sustainable access of effective antimicrobials treatment for patients.
In terms of suicides, an average of 67 people committed suicide between 2012 and 2017. Family disputes and relationship problems are the most common contributing factors for individuals to attempt or commit suicide. Fiji in partnership with stakeholders and other organizations are working to create awareness on suicide prevention and mental health. For example there are efforts currently undertaken by the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization based on primary health care and school based support for mental health issues.
Deaths due to road traffic injuries have gone from 46 in 2012 to 89 in 2017. The number of vehicles on roads has also increased significantly over this period. Crosssectoral partnerships and joint efforts with stakeholders outside the boundaries of the Ministry of Health are needed to combat these accidents. Strong leadership from authorities such as the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and the Police Force is needed. 
To ensure a sustainable health workforce, Fiji is committed to enhancing professional development in the recruitment, development, training and retention of the health workforce. Additional health workers are being recruited to address health workforce shortages and meet the demand required at health facilities. Fiji is increasing investments in local academic institutions have allowed expansion in the number of health courses available as well as increased student enrolments into the health fraternity. Investments in human resource efforts have seen the health worker density and distribution ratio rise from 2.3 in 1999 to 4.6 in 2016. A WHO 2016 report states 4.45 as a minimum indicative threshold of nurses, doctors and midwives for universal health coverage and the SDGs.
Way Forward
The epidemic of NCDs that has plagued the nation requires both curative treatment and preventive actions. This challenge needs to be overcome through actions that target all aspects of the health system, including governance, health workforce, health financing, essential medicines and technologies, health information system, as well as health delivery. Ultimately the most viable option for combatting NCDs is continuing to focus efforts on prevention and primary healthcare.
There is room to reduce child mortality rate further by tackling the root causes relating to demographics, health system, health service delivery and patients’ health seeking behaviors. Similar approach needs to be taken to deliver good quality sexual and reproductive health services throughout the country.
Reducing the risk of mosquito-borne disease to improve health and well-beingMosquito-borne disease affects the lives of thousands of people in Fiji. In 2018 alone, the Ministry of Health and Medical Services recorded 4000 confirmed cases of dengue, with nine fatalities. This places a significant social and economic burden on all levels of society, including the Fijian Government. The World Mosquito Programs’ Fijian projects are working to significantly reduce the risk of mosquito-borne disease, such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika.
    Wolbachia is a safe, naturally occurring bacterium present in up to 60% of insect species, such as butterflies and moths. When present in the Aedes aegypti mosquito, the primary vector for dengue, chikungunya and Zika, Wolbachia significantly reduces the mosquito’s ability to pass these diseases between people. The World Mosquito Program’s Wolbachia method involves the release of Wolbachia carrying mosquitoes into communities, where they breed with wild Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and pass Wolbachia to their offspring. Unlike most other initiatives, the Wolbachia method is natural and self-sustaining. Communities across the Central and West Divisions of Viti Levu have welcomed the Wolbachia method.
Long-term monitoring of WMP’s international project sites shows that Wolbachia is self-sustaining at high levels for many years after releases have stopped. In areas where a high level of Wolbachia is present, there have not been any local dengue outbreaks. Similar outcomes are expected in Fiji.
WMP Fijian projects are carried out in partnership with the Ministry of Health and Medical Services and Live and Learn Environmental Education. Fiji’s Central Division Project is funded by the Australian Government, while the Western Division is funded by the New Zealand Aid Programme. This contributes to a global effort to control and reduce mosquito-borne disease outbreaks, one of the largest public health initiatives ever undertaken. WMP’s work to mobilise financial resources from partners and funders will help to reduce mosquito-borne diseases in Fiji, helping make Fiji a healthier place to live.Some progress has been made over the years to increase the finances available for health. Government financing remains the dominant source of funds accounting for approximately 64% of total Current Health Expenditure (CHE) in 2016. Large public investment in health means that out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditure for health remains relatively low at 21% of total CHE. However this percentage has increased from what was 15% in 2015. Thus moving forward efforts will be made to better track catastrophic health spending and the impoverishment effects of health spending. The MoHMS will work with the National Statistics Office and the World Health Organization to move this forward.
Other interventions that are imperative includes improvement in the current health system; evidence based decision making; research and development; and increased health financing and strengthening capacity to reduce health risks. 

SDG 4: Quality Education
Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for allCurrent Status and Trends
Fiji upholds education as the most effective pathway to growing the Fijian economy, enriching Fijian society, and advancing the upward mobility of the Fijian people. Fiji’s National Development Plan (NDP) is aimed at reducing education inequality through universal access to education at all levels and improving education quality that facilitates Fiji’s transition into knowledge based society. 
Rapid increase in enrolment over the years has been the direct result of the policy initiatives towards accomplishment of access to education for every child in the nation. Early Childhood Education policy was introduced in the year 2007, which is a significant movement towards Fiji’s National Development Plan goal of achieving universal early childhood care and education. Net school enrolment rate is a target indicator that addresses the retention and completion of pre-school education. Since 2000, the enrolment of five-year-old children in pre-primary school has increased. In 2015, nearly 80 per cent of five-year-old children were enrolled at pre-primary schools, up from 11.8 per cent in 2000, an almost 6-fold increase. Overall, 
Fiji has maintained a teacher student ratio of 1:24 for Early Childhood Education Grant Assistance

early childhood education. Some factors leading to this increase was the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) grant to ECCE centres, ECCE building grant for infrastructure renovation and upgrading, and ECCE teachers grant for recruiting teaching professionals.
Investment in the education sector has resulted in achieving 99% target for universal primary education and raising secondary school enrolment from 77% to 90%.The result is supported by Fiji’s National Development Plan objectives in ensuring equal opportunity and access to quality learning opportunities at all levels of education in a lifelong perspective. Exam pass rate is a target indicator for measuring quality access to education. The introduction of LANA helps in formative assessment of Year 5 and Year 7 in terms of providing feedback to students, teachers and parents on students’ learning progress and providing intervention (at individual, school and national level) to improve students’ learning in literacy and numeracy. At the national level, Year 5 and Year 7 students are reasonably proficient in literacy and numeracy achievement and this performance has been improving over time. Likewise, summative assessment to measure students’ learning after 10, 12 and 13 years of school helps gauge students learning.

Fiji’ initiatives towards quality access to education 
for primary and secondary education was maintained through the free education policy, provision of free text books policy, implementation of free transport assistance and free milk initiative for Year 1 students to influence children to develop a lifelong healthy habit of consuming milk and milk product. 
Tertiary enrolment rate in Fiji is estimated to be around 30 per cent, a significant increase from 16 per cent in 2003- 2005. The quality and relevance of education needs to improve, to address the growing number of out-of-school children and adolescents, and to support the transition of young people from school to work .The focus has now shifted to quality and relevance; learning pathways inclusive of lifelong learning; and hence Fiji supports Tertiary education and Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET). The Technical College of Fiji [TCF] is an initiative for the ordinary Fijians to get the education and training that provides skills to compete in today’s competitive job market. For TCF education, Fiji has maintained a 1:10 teacher student ratio. Funding assistance provided towards higher education in Fiji, includes national tertiary scholarships, low interest loan schemes and allowances for students from low-income families.
Fiji has made progress in improving education system for inclusion of children with disability. There are 22 secondary schools in Fiji now; includes students with various impairments,  initiatives for inclusive education particularly for people living with disabilities implemented by academic institutions like the University of the South Pacific’s Disability Resource Centre which provides buddy support, sign language interpreters and other services continue to ensure successful learning outcomes with People Living with Disabilities (PLWD). Frank Hilton boasts a multicultural and multi-religious student body that promotes respect, non-discrimination and social harmony. The school offers primary education (Classes 1-8) as well as pre- vocational training. The pre vocational training unit offers wood work and carpentry. A wide range of extracurricular activities complement the education programme and students are offered a chance to be a part of home gardening clubs, cooking, sports, dance and music.
There has been inclusiveness of gender equality towards access to education in Fiji. Gender equality is an indicator measure for equal education opportunity. Majority of the male population in primary school are enrolled in comparison to the female population. While

Secondary Enrollments by Gender 2018

there is female dominance in secondary enrolment, males have had equal opportunity for secondary enrolment over the years.
Private sector initiatives also support the aspirations of disadvantaged populations such as women and rural communities through targeted support. Initiatives such as the Westpac Women’s Education Grant for university studies and the more comprehensive Katalyst Foundation support to rural schools in Northern Division Fiji, are examples of how private sector provides continuous support for education. 
Civil society organisations have long supported the dreams of generations of Fijians for a better life through quality education. Thousands of Fijians pass through primary and secondary school education annually due in part to the efforts of community-run schools and faith based organisations. These include the Catholic Church, the Methodist Church of Fiji, Sangam Fiji, Sanatan Fiji, Arya Samaj of Fiji, Assemblies of God and the Seventh Day Adventist Church amongst many others whose schools and learning institutions make up majority of the country’s existing primary and secondary school institutions. Fiji’s Development partners were also integral, in which they supported the Fijian education sector by contributing FJD $350 million between 2010 and 2017.
Gaps and Challenges
While Fiji’s targets to achieve universal primary education and early childhood education have been notable, the underpinning challenges in achieving the secondary and tertiary educations targets are still evident.
Access to Early Childhood Education (ECE) has significantly improved to 80% by 2015. The Ministry of Education’s policy of attaching pre-schools to primary schools and increasing the level of teacher grants have contributed to this progress. However, there are still around 20% pre-school children outside the school system. Despite global advances in ECCE, significant challenges remain in the provision of quality services to young children and their families in Fiji. The 20% low attendance is likely influenced by poor quality provision and lack of awareness among parents of the value of early learning mostly in rural communities. Plans to improve access to early childhood education include expanding rural facilities, addressing poor building standards, and attracting and retaining qualified teachers. Fiji over the decade has realized the need to invest in early childhood education for achieving the nation’s human capital and National Development Plan (NDP) objectives.
Fiji has maintained the secondary school enrolments at around 80%. However, around 20 per cent of secondary school age children are outside the school system. Consequently, Fiji faces the challenges of tackling root causes of not participating in secondary education and improving secondary school. In addition to this, the high youth unemployment rate suggests that many students, especially girls, leave school without employable skills. There has been a big expansion of technical and vocational education and training, but the need for access to appropriate qualifications and training remains high. Furthermore, Fiji may also face the challenges of designing appropriate technical and vocational education and training to cater for the demands of the job markets. There is an increased understanding of the importance of TVET and higher education although they are not yet adequately funded, monitored or evaluated.
The significant disparities in access to good education are reflected in school achievements between urban and rural residents. Patterns in the distribution of poverty are reflected in unequal outcomes in education. Rural and remoteness hamper the delivery of quality and inclusive education. Schools in rural areas are typically disadvantaged in regard to communication and transport services, quality of teachers posted to them, inadequately equipped and lack basic facilities such as science laboratories, libraries and sports facilities. Limited schools in rural and remote areas cater for the special needs of children with disabilities. This reduces disadvantaged children’s access to school and hampers the delivery of inclusive education delivery in these areas.
The School Information Management System has potential to improve the monitoring and evaluation of education programs but is still underutilized in some respects. There are many opportunities to improve the evaluation of the impact of education programs on student achievements. Better monitoring and evaluation systems could also identify new issues, and assist all education providers to fine-tune their programs and policies. The Ministry of Education may also consider integrating SDG 4 targets and indicators into its M&E framework.
Way Forward
The ultimate objective of Fiji’s National Development Plan is to ensure quality access to education and schools across the country. Development in education system to improve access, retention, progression, completion, and quality education at all levels to ensure all children will have equitable access to a progressive, inclusive and quality education that contributes to socioeconomic advancement, and open pathways to regional and international opportunities. It is essential to review reforms in education curricula that ensure implementing relevant, quality, responsive and innovative curriculums, to enable children to acquire knowledge and wisdom, develop lifelong skills and cultural, moral and religious values that contribute to good citizenship. There is a need to focus on improving quality and relevance of education and cognitive learning outcomes, where results such as literacy and numeracy have not made the expected gains for all. There is also a renewed focus on lifelong learning with early childhood care education and postsecondary education and training needing priority attention. Changes in approaches to learning will require new ways of teaching.
The development of creative, innovative, and quality learning, and competent vocational training that fosters sustainable development and enables students to acquire technological entrepreneurship, adaptability and employability, and vocational skills. The focus on developing e-learning in rural communities’ for quality access to education, builds towards transformational change. Although there has been progress, Fiji should review its initiative towards e-learning as it helps improve education quality and engages youths, therefore reduces disparity between rural and urban areas and eliminates the stress of not having access to education.


Special and Inclusive EducationEducation for students with special needs has been in existence in Fiji since the 1960’s, when some Catholic Church schools such as, St Joseph’s Secondary School and Marist Brothers High School enrolled students with disabilities. However, students with severe or less visible disabilities such as, hearing impairment and intellectual disability were still getting left out.
Hilton Fiji was the first special school introduced in Fiji, in the year 1967 and several other special schools including vocational centres were established to cater for the needs of special education. The more important work of these schools was guided by Fiji’s first policy on education for children with disabilities in year 2010.
The Ministry of Education has been making efforts to strengthen inclusive education options for children with disabilities and their families across Fiji, while continuing to support the services that specials schools provide children with particular and complex disabilities. 
With support from the Australian aid program together with MoEHA, number of activities to support children with disabilities , including the employment of teacher aids, training of teachers and teacher aides in inclusive education, awareness raising sessions, regular mentoring and monitoring visits, renovations to schools to improve  access and learning environments, provision of resources such as the Toolkit for Disability inclusive education in Fiji, equipment provisions like Braille machine, white canes, desktop computer with JAWS software, sign language and water and sanitations activities were implemented. These activities have contributed to an increase number of children with disabilities participating in schools close to their homes and these positive experiences enabled the Ministry’s efforts of establishing additional inclusive schools across the country. 
A new Special and Inclusive Education Policy 2017-2020 was implemented which recognized the efforts made under the previous policy to increase Ministry of Educations support for special schools and to pilot inclusive education within mainstream schools. Because of these efforts, 60 primary schools across Fiji reported children with disabilities attending in 2017, and there are now 22 secondary schools in Fiji which have students with a variety of impairments attending, all of whom passed the necessary entrance examination on academic merit. 
The new initiative required monitoring and evaluation on how data is gathered, therefore policies and implementation to reform the way the data is being collected and reported was conducted within the MoEHA data information system- FEMIS. These tools for collection of data on students with disabilities and reports helped strengthen the capacity of teachers to understand who does and who does not have disabled their classroom and assisted their classroom practices to improve education quality and provide reasonable accommodations for students during learning assessment activities. Fiji is working in collaboration with Australia and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with disability in achieving the Fiji’s NDP goal towards quality access to education for every child in the country. 
SDG 5: GENDER EQUALITY
Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls

Current Status and Trends
Gender equality is a fundamental human right, that it is an inherent component of economic growth and development. It recognises that ethnicity, disability, religion and gender often intersect and create a multiplicity of sources of discrimination against women 
in Fiji.11
The 2013 Fiji Constitution recognises the critical importance of gender equality and human rights in its efforts to empowering women and children across all development sectors. Fiji’s 5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan (‘NDP’) has committed to empower women to reach their full development potential with specific indicators which include:
• Having at least 20 percent women parliament members by 2018
• Having at least 35 percent women as SOE Board Directors by 2021
• Having at least 25 percent women working in Ministries/Departments by 2021
• Having 	at 	least 	40 	percent 	women participation in paid employment by 2021
• Having at least 65 percent women participating in National Women’s Expos achieving Fiji Made status for their product by 2021
The Women’s Plan of Action (‘WPA’) 2010-2019 is well aligned towards the Beijing Platform of Action, the Pacific Platform of Action and the Roadmap for Democracy and Sustainable Socio Economic Development. The WPA will be reviewed next year where it will update on the progress for the past 10 years on women’s formal employment and livelihoods, their equal participation in decision making, elimination of gender-based violence, improved access to basic services, and women and the law. Fiji’s recently launched National Adaptation Plan and Fiji’s 2014 National Gender Policy are part and parcel of the overall national commitments to promote inclusive socio economic, improve the well-being of all Fijians, promote gender equality, promote social justice, and enhance implementation changes to the lives of women to reach their full potential regardless of their gender, religion and sexuality.
Further to the above, Fiji has also committed to international podiums such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. In 2018 Fiji also ratified the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights as well as the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights underlining the voice being heard of us Small Island Developing States.
In terms of overall progress Fiji’s ranking on the World Economic Forum’s global gender gap has improved significantly from 2015 shifting 15 places up from 121 to 106 out of 187 countries, in 2018. Fiji is currently the only Pacific Island country to be ranked in the World Economic Forum Report (The Global Gender Gap Report, 2018)12.
As of 2018, 20 percent of Parliamentary seats were held by women, with nearly 77 percent of adult women having reached at least a secondary level of education compared to 68 percent of their male counterparts. For every 100,000 live births, 30 women die from pregnancy related causes which is below the SDG target for maternal mortality and the adolescent birth rate is 43.9 births per 1,000 women of ages 15-19.
According to the Fiji Bureau of Statistics 2017 Household and Population Census, 37.4 percent females are being employed in the Fijian labour force compared to 76.4 percent males. Despite that Fiji is continuing to enhance the workforce participation of women, with the potential of contributing towards the significant growth of Fiji’s economy. The Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation have received a 42 percent increase in the 2017-2018 budget and a 15 percent increase in the 2018-2019 budget allowing for more allocation of resources, opportunities and services delivered to assist women and NGO partners in the pursuit of economic development.
In 2018, the Fijian Government introduced the Parenthood Assistance Payments whereby mothers from families with a household income below $30,000, 
Labour Force Participation Rates by Gender, 2007 and 2017

upon the birth of her child, whether it be her first, second, third child and so on, will be granted FJ $1,000. Furthermore to this, the government also increased the paid maternity leave from 84 working days to 98 working days, adding another two weeks for mothers to take off from work in the preparation of the birth and in the care of their child.
A report on women’s representation on boards of stateowned enterprises (‘SOEs’) in Pacific Island Forum Countries also highlighted that across the 19 SOEs in Fiji that have boards, 58 percent have a woman on their boards; 9 women hold 11 seats13 . Similarly, a 2015 country assessment by the Asian Development Bank highlighted that out of a total of 87 director seat in 26 SOEs in 2013, women holds 10 percent of director positions14. In addition to these the Late Honorable Dr. Jiko Luveni in 2014 became the first lady speaker of the Fijian parliament showcasing women empowerment in the decision making aspects of the Fiji’s political agenda.
Progress is also evident in the iTaukei traditional social structure whereby women are given leadership roles and responsibilities. Traditionally, Fijian male heirs generally inherit traditional titles and ensuing responsibilities, with women only inheriting title if there are no male survivors. However, data from the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs shows that women hold 7 percent of village chief positions and 8 percent of positions as head of landowning units.15
In maintaining its national development goals towards a sustainable and inclusive country, Fiji has made several commitments to achieve gender equality. 
These include the 2003 Family Law Act, the 2009 Domestic Violence Act, provisions in the Constitution and the re-establishment of the Elimination of Violence Against Women (EVAW) Taskforce in 2013, whereby government is working towards providing positive and innovative approaches to achieving gender equality and to eliminating discrimination and violence against women16 ; implementing the 2018 Fiji National Employment Policy; and the use of innovative modalities to deliver health services to women in rural areas. An Online Safety Act was passed in 2018 in response to the high levels of sexual exploitation of women and girls on online and to promote online safety and prevent cyberbullying and abuse inflicted online.
Donors and the private sector organisations continue to support the Fijian Government through providing responsive primary and preventative sexual and reproductive health care. The public and private clinics provide integrated sexual health services including testing, counselling, and monitoring of patients on antiretroviral drugs. NGOs such as the Fiji Women’s Crisis Centre (‘FWCC’) and the Fiji Women’s Right Movement (‘FWRM’) have been heavily active in advocating on the issues of gender equality and violence against women. The Fiji Commerce & Employers’ Federation have been working towards supporting the Women Entrepreneurs and Business Council and works to promote and provide female entrepreneurs with leadership training and women’s participation in decision making. Response to Gender Based Violence continues to be a strong focus of government policy and programmes in ensuring that the health sector provides strong support to victims. The Fijian Government continues to support the civil society organisations and the relevant implementing agencies through annual budgetary allocations.
Gaps and Challenges
The 2013 survey report on National Research on Women’s Health conducted by FWCC, highlighted that violence against women and girls is still predominant in Fiji. There were high rates of non-partner abuse, with 31 percent of respondents being subject to physical and or sexual assault since the age of 15 by someone other than their husbands or partners. Sexual assault rates were also high, with 29% of women reporting that their first sexual experience was either forced or coerced17. A 2017 research report “Balancing the Scales: Improving Fijian Women’s Access to Justice” found that 9 out 10 sexual offence cases (rape, attempted rape, indecent assault, child sexual abuse) reported to the Fiji Women, women and girls are the victims and survivors18.  In 2018 FWRM released a three year trend analysis which found that the average age of the victim/survivor of sexual violence is under 17 years in Fiji and that in majority of cases the perpetrator is known or related to the victim19.
Males are still continuing to dominate the workforce with a significant gender differential in the unemployment rates that is 2.9 percent for males and 7.8 percent for females. Greater burden of unpaid household and care work, informal employment, lack of control over income and assets, lower levels of education and lack of access to trainings are some of the key barriers restricting economic participation of women in the nation.
According to Fiji’s Employment and Unemployment Survey 2015, women spent between 26 hours per week (or 3.7 hours per day) on unpaid domestic and care work, while men spent 10 hours per week (or 1.4 hours per day). Even women in employment have to spend 24 hours per week on unpaid domestic and care work20.
Despite the zero tolerance policy on violence against women, some women are still apprehensive about lodging police complaints because of family pressure, cultural restrictions about going against household heads resulting in cases of incest, marital rape and child abuse being unreported. An FWRM research report also found out that women experienced violence for an average of 868 days before they went to the police and courts to resolve these issues21.
Way Forward
Increasing female participation in the labor force, raising women’s representation in political and economic decision making, mainstreaming gender equality in social and economic development, tackling genderbased violence, implementation of gender equality and women’s empowerment policies and programs and strengthening monitoring are some of the key challenge areas that Fiji needs to tackle in with the support of NGOs and civil society organisations to improve the implementation of policies and programs and bring its attention to the areas of gender inequality across the nation.
Fiji will continue to work with NGOs, regional partners and civil society groups including the faith-based organisations to create a gender-fair society that protects and promotes the rights of gender equality through the implementation of its policies and 
programmes. 


Intergenerational Women’s Leadership Program
Image Credit :  http://www.fwrm.org.fj/programmes/intergenerational-womens-leadership
The InterGenerational Women’s Leadership (IWLP) program is targeted at developing and enhancing young women and girls’ leadership and capacity to create positive change in their communities. Since 2003, the Fiji Women’s Right Movement (FWRM) has worked with young women and girls in Fiji aged 10 – 25 years and supported the development of similar programmes in the Pacific. These include women’s organizations such as the Young Christian Women’s Association (YWCA) in the Solomon Islands, Kup Women for Peace in Papua New Guinea and Tonga’s Women for Action.
The program involves working closely with young women and girls in developing their leadership and advocacy skills at the national, regional and international foras through capacity-building workshops; design, production and dissemination of information educational and communication materials and facilitating the inclusion of young Pacific women at policy making forums.
FWRM works with a diversity of young women including young trans-women, young women with disabilities and girls aged between 10-12 years to mobilize a critical mass of such marginalized communities to tackle women’s issues at all levels of political and social activity.
FWRM believes that a cornerstone of young women’s leadership is inter-generational learning. By facilitating opportunities where women leaders share their knowledge and skills with young women, FWRM contributes to a vibrant alliance of women leaders throughout Fiji and the region.
Currently there are four main components of the IWLP which includes the Girls (Grow, Inspire, Relate, Lead, Succeed) program, the Emerging Leaders Forum, the Fiji Young Women’s Forum and the Fiji Women’s forum with an addition of a Women in Ageing programme in the pipeline.
Current Status and Trends
Access to clean water is both a fundamental right of every Fijian, as enshrined in the Fijian Constitution (2013), and an essential component of sustainable development. Over 700,000 Fijians nationwide benefit from the current water supply scheme. Fiji reformed the Water and Sewerage Department in 2009. The objective of this reform was to enhance the sustainable delivery of water and sewerage services to appropriate levels of service. The reform aimed at strengthening the then Water and Sewerage Department (WSD) before establishing the Water Authority of Fiji (WAF), which is dedicated to the delivery of water supply and sewerage services. According to Census undertaken in 2017, 70.1% of households in Fiji have access to piped water for drinking, which is slightly lower than the world average of 71%. However, the remaining 30% of the households have to rely on dug well protected or unprotected, spring water protected or unprotected, rain water, communal tanks, surface water, Borehole, etc. for drinking. 
Therefore, significant gaps in accessing piped water between rural households and urban households still exists. 96.8% of the urban households have access to piped water, while only 35% of the rural households have access to piped water. Several SDG 6 targets and indicators have been explicitly integrated into Fiji’s National Development Plan and the Green Growth Framework, including to achieve 100% of the population to have access to clean and safe water in adequate quantities and 60% of population to have access to central sewerage system by 2031, and to reduce the amount of unaccounted water (leaks, theft, unmetered, %) to 32% by 2021.

As a result, numerous initiatives have been undertaken to develop and overcome the rural water gaps in Fiji such as the enhanced water security in rural village’s project which provides improved water and sanitation management, implemented by Rotary Pacific Water. The $45,000 project was an investment by the Rotary Pacific Water for Life Foundation reaffirming its commitment to the SDG 6 by ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. In achieving this, a new solar ground water supply system was constructed which included the installation of a solar pump, water storage tanks, distribution channel to communities and the construction of gender segregated sanitation facilities. 
Where treated water cannot be supplied due to remoteness and access, Ecological Purification System (EPS) is being installed. Over 26,000 Fijians now benefit from the EPS system in village communities.
Furthermore, the DWS works in conjunction with WAF to monitor and formulate policies for the provision of a sustainable water and wastewater sector. This includes the formulation and implementation of a National Water Resource Management and Sanitation Policy (NWRSMP) to govern the planning and the development of water resource while reviewing some of the existing policies and legislative processes governing the provision of water and sanitation services in order to improve the quality of service and access. This exercise also ensures the engagement of relevant stakeholders and community awareness on water conservation practices and protection of traditional water sources. The Department continues to work on the establishment of a National Water Statistics database while managing the following initiatives; Water Conservation Programme; National Liquid Trade Waste Policy; Rural Water and Sanitation Policy and the Rural Water Supply Management Guideline.
WAF Billing System is a correct reflection of actual on the ground and the reason for the above decline in percentage cover of outreach. This is the major reason for the decline in both water and waste water access percentage cover. 
Additionally, a multimillion dollar investment in a one piece of massive Urban Water Supply and Waste Water Management Project is being undertaken by the WAF (2015 – 2025) – a project which will expand and upgrade water and wastewater infrastructure to the tune of 855 million dollars. Ultimately, over 300,000 of Fiji’s people stand to benefit from this investment, by enjoying more reliable access to clean water and leading healthier lives, thanks to new advancements in the management of wastewater. This will improve climate resilience by taking water from further up the river system to avoid salinity. 
Wastage will be reduced through meter replacement and improved leakage detection and repairs. Waste water management will be strengthened by upgrading and increasing the capacity of the Kinoya treatment plant, improving sewer coverage, and adding new treatment facilities.

Since 2016 to date, WHO are continuing to support the Fiji Ministry of Health and Medical Services together with collaboration of the other relevant government stakeholders on WASH in contextualising the SDG 6 targets and indicators on water. The focus areas are on the targets 6.1 (Achieve access to safe and affordable drinking water), 6.2 (Achieve access to sanitation and hygiene and end open defecation) and 6.3, (Improve water quality, wastewater treatment and safe reuse). Although there has been challenges, some progress has been made to capture progress for Fiji 

The increase in decommissioned meters has been a concern and challenge to identify in 2018 for WAF. The investigation shall be a basis to rectify if the classification of this data/information captured by the in relation to the SDG – Goal 6 on WASH. The Health Island Monitoring Framework for Fiji, the inclusion of WASH question in the last census of 2017 for Fiji and the participation of Fiji in the GLAAS exercises – Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking Water are examples of how these targets are currently being monitored. 
Gaps and Challenges
With increased manufacturing and economic development, a high demand for sewerage and water supply is a continuous challenge for Fiji.  The fragmented roles and responsibilities of different agencies in the water and sewerage sector currently make monitoring a continuous challenge especially with data sharing. There is no centralised database for water resources data which could be used for reporting and planning works. The Department doesn’t have the capacity and resources to develop legislation and standards. These works need to be carried out by specialist/experts and would require appropriate funding. Challengers in the area of skilled workforce are yet another consideration including an aging Infrastructure. Issues of water in rural areas and in the outer islands are of a concern given the remoteness from the central water access facilities.
Way Forward
Fiji has one of the lowest tariffs on the provision of clean treated water. We may need to conserve water by introducing tariffs as low cost accessibility also comes with poor water management. In 2017, the Water Authority Fiji was allocated FJ$307 million, increasing from FJ$101.5 million in 2012 to support the numerous projects and initiatives. A Technical Working Committee (TWC) has been established to work on the merger of the two policies and the development of the NWRSMP. The TWC consists of members from all relevant stakeholders and this way all matters pertaining to the water sector will be included in the policy. This policy is a concerted effort to coordinate water sector activities in Fiji in a more integrated manner and achieve the national and international water goals. A Water Statistics Database has been established which will be continuously updated to provide information to stakeholders. 
The data sharing agreements are already in place with relevant stakeholders. The Department has an AKVO FLOW Dashboard that would be used to centralized data on SDGs. The AKVO foundation have been engaged to support the ministry to train, develop and implement the information system that will collect WASH data from relevant WASH government agencies in a central database. WAF is continuously building capacity inhouse and with scholarships and trainings including proper people care that includes proper remuneration and staff retention programs. 
Clean and Safe Water for All Fijians
Nakoso Village, a small rural community in Cakaudrove province now has access to clean and safe drinking water after the commissioning of a new water intake dam, a tank base with 10,000 litres of water storage that connects piped water to every household in the village. This has revolutionised the lives of 60 villagers who previously relied on untreated water from a nearby river for drinking, cooking, washing and bathing, which often exposed them to dangerous germs and diseases. Productivity in the village has increased as women do not have to carry water from the river to do household chores allowing more time to engage in other economic activities. Children are less likely to fall ill as they now have access to clean water allowing them to attend school consistently. Overall sanitation has improved as use of flush toilets and piped septic tanks has been made possible.
Nakoso Village is one of 51 rural communities that have been assisted in the 2018-2019 financial year through the Rural Water Supply Programme administered by the Water Authority of Fiji. Of the 51 rural communities assisted as at 30 April 2019, 27 were from the Central Division, 9 from Eastern Division, 1 from the Western Division and 14 from the Northern Division. Work in an additional 36 rural communities is currently underway and is expected to be completed by the end of the 2018-2019 financial (31 July 2019). Material procurement is also underway for a further 14 rural communities. A sum of FJ $27 million was allocated in the 2018-2019 financial year from the Fijian Budget of which FJ $6.7 million was used from the Environment and Climate Action Levy proceeds as at 30 April 2019 to deliver community- based, tailormade water reticulation solutions that include modern catchment systems, portable treatment plants and innovative EPS.For the Education Sector to address key areas of skills like Engineering in specific fields like SCADA, GIS, Water/ Waste Water modeling, Utility Economics, Climate Change Adaptation for Utilities, Water & Waste Water Engineering etc. is a key priority. WAF in its experience has gone through a lot of challenges whereby numerous policies, procedures, approvals and discussions are required to protect the interest of WAF and people of Fiji. Where this was done in good faith it is now posing itself as being indecisive costing opportunities for improvement in time. Therefore, a resultant customer sub-standardized service(s). In continuing to achieve the targets of a rapidly growing economy of Fiji, there needs to be an added administrative taskforce in WAF to allow the capacity in achieving data efficiency while meeting the regulatory targets on field. Fiji is now transitionally more rapidly into environmental control of waste and pollution from hazardous chemicals and will continue to monitor this into the waterways to ensure that safe drinking water standards are maintained. 

Current Status and Trends
As a small island developing state experiencing consistent economic growth and increasing socioeconomic development, Fiji’s energy requirement is on an increasing trajectory22 requiring increased investments in electricity generation and investments in rural electrification to ensure every Fijian has access to electricity. 
Access to electricity has widespread impact on development indicators, including health, education, food security, gender equality, livelihoods, and poverty 

Percentage of Population with Access to Electricity


reduction. Fiji remains steadfast on increasing affordable, reliable and modern access to energy from 90 percent of the total population in 2015 to 100 percent by 2021 in line with its 5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan. This is critical to ensure that all Fijians have access to basic needs enshrined in the 2013 National Constitution and equal opportunities to excel in life. 
The last remaining percent of the population without energy largely live in isolated settlements and maritime islands that do not have access to the national electricity grid operated by the sole electricity provider, Energy Fiji Limited (‘EFL’).  To address this, the Fiji has progressively invested in rural electrification through grid extensions and installation of Solar Home Systems with over FJ $132.9 million allocated from 2016-2017 to 2018-2019. In true spirit of partnerships emphasised by the SDGs, the Fijian Government is also working with the private sector, development partners, philanthropic organizations and NGOs to deliver affordable, clean and reliable energy to more than 300 rural communities living without electricity throughout Fiji. This is being done through the new established Fiji Rural Electrification Fund (FREF). 
Moreover, to make electricity affordable for low income households, the Fijian Government has been running an electricity subsidy programme since 2015 for households with a combined income of FJ $30,000 whereby the first 100 kilowatt hours of electricity per month is paid by the state. This has helped reduce the financial obligations of Fijian families in combination with other initiatives such as the free water subsidy programme. 
These initiatives have had widespread positive impacts on improving universal access to electricity in Fiji. The 2017 national census found that 94 percent of all households have access to some form of electricity of which 78 percent rely on the national electricity grid, 12.4 percent rely on solar energy and the remaining 3.6 percent rely on diesel generators and communal diesel and hydro plants.   
Further to its Nationally Determined Contribution (‘NDC’) commitment to reduce 30 percent of its national greenhouse emissions through renewable investments in the energy sector and achieve 99 percent renewable energy generation by 2030, Fiji is cognisant of the fact that improving access to electricity for all Fijians must be coupled with green investments into existing and new electricity generation. Given that EFL owns most of Fiji’s energy generation assets, it has committed itself to this national priority by committing to a renewable and low carbon future through its Power Development Plan leading up to 2026. 
In 2017, Fiji’s share of renewable energy generation, which has been on a declining trend, stood at 51.26 percent of which 48.7 percent was from hydropower, 0.21 percent from wind power and 2.33 percent from independent power producers using biomass23. To improve Fiji’s electricity generation mix, EFL is working with Government in partnership with development partners and the private sector to prepare for investments into hydro and solar power – two energy sources that have been found to have largest energy potential in Fiji. EFL is in the process of increasing its hydro power generation capacity through the upcoming Qaliwana/Upper Wailoa Diversion Hydro Project which is envisaged to produce up to 44 megawatts of electricity subject to detail feasibility studies. Moreover, EFL has also identified land in the western division of Fiji, an area with significant periods of sunshine, for potential development of upto 25 megawatts of solar photovoltaic energy generation on Viti Levu, Fiji’s largest and most populous island. Immediate plans are to establish a 5 megawatt solar farm in Nadi, which is growing rapidly as Fiji’s tourism hub. 
Gaps and Challenges 
Fiji’s high dependence of imported polluting fossil fuels is placing significant burden on balance of payments, drawing resources away from other development efforts and contributing towards increased greenhouse emissions. Mineral oil imports in 2017 were estimated to total FJ $931.2 million, accounting for 19 percent of the total national import bill to which electricity generation is a significant contributor. Moreover, electricity generation contributes more than 16.2 percent to Fiji’s total greenhouse emissions. 
While Fiji continues to embark on a low carbon future in line with the 5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan, the NDC Implementation Roadmap and the Low Emissions Development Strategy, access to affordable, adequate and predictable finance remains a challenge as the Fijian Government and EFL cannot bear the cost of maintaining and retrofitting existing energy assets and investing in new renewable energy assets on its own. According to EFL’s Power Development Plan, a sum of FJ $2.5 billion is required to fund its future investments in line with projected increase in energy demand and the national renewable energy targets. FEA only has the capacity to fund FJ $870 million while the rest will need to be sourced from innovative financing solutions. 
Private sector involvement in the electricity sector remains low in the absence of conducive regulatory environment, unattractive feed in tariff rates and low uptake of fiscal incentives for renewable energy investments. However, over the past few years, the emergence of private solar providers offering innovative product financing solutions has catalyzed a marked increase in uptake of rooftop solar by the commercial companies. 
There is a need to build regulatory and innovative capacity of the Department of Energy and the Fiji Competition and Consumer Commission in line with its responsibilities stipulated in the Fiji Electricity Act (2017). Flexible, progressive and solution oriented regulators are envisaged to not only foster an increase in private sector involvement but also attract investments from bilateral and multilateral financiers.
The adverse impacts of climate change continue to threaten the electricity sector. The category 5 Tropical Cyclone Winston in 2016 destroyed electricity assets amounting to FJ $33 million and caused losses associated with intermittent electricity supply amounting to FJ $8.1 million. Since then cyclones Keni and Josie in 2018 and other tropical depression have continued to damage overhead power lines and main transmission towers. As Fiji seeks to adapt to climate change, investments in the electricity sector to build resilience and longevity of assets is crucial. Investments to green the electricity sector must also incorporate the incremental cost of making those investments climate 
resilient.
Way Forward
Efforts to increase access to electricity to all Fijian will continue with increased vigour. To maximise efficiency of both standalone solutions and grid connections, the Fijian Government has embarked on formulating a rural electrification masterplan with technical assistance from the Asian Development Bank. A national electrification plan will be integral to achieving 100% electrification especially for those in inaccessible regions. 
While increasing access to electricity remains a development priority for Fiji, it will continue to peruse to priority in tandem with its climate mitigation targets. Fiji’s third largest island of Taveuni is currently electrified through hydro sources. However, there are some parts of the island which is yet to be electrified. In order to maintain 100% renewable energy sources on the island, the Fijian Government is partnering with the Global Green Growth Institute and the Korean International Cooperation Agency to install a 1.55 megawatt solar power plant on the island to supplement its hydro capacity and meet growing electricity demands with renewable energy. 
Fiji’s geothermal resources and power generation capacity is widely unknown at this stage. The Fiji National Determined Contribution Roadmap (2017-2030) outlines the need to carry out further investigation on the island of Vanua Levu to establish the feasibility of geothermal power generation. The Fijian Government, with assistance from the World Bank has recently engaged experienced foreign company to determine the geothermal potential of Vanua Levu, Fiji’s second largest island. This is expected to determine Fiji’s potential to diversify electricity base and address the volatility in renewable energy production due to high dependence on hydropower. 
Fiscal incentives for investments in renewable energy will be scaled up and actively promoted amongst the private sector as well as the global energy solution providers. To foster continued Research and development (R&D) of new, cleaner, renewable energy technologies within various sectors of its economy, a 250% tax deduction incentive on any expenditure incurred by eligible companies investing in R&D within the renewable energy sector has been introduced in Fiji. Building expanded reliable access to electricity in Fiji is expected to promote employment, including homebased industries that offer increased opportunities for female employment, and increase productivity in the agriculture and service sectors. Fiji is a small open economy, highly vulnerable to volatility in global energy prices. The marginalised spend more of their income on fuel and energy, and the fiscal space to support subsidies to the poor is very limited. Diversification of generation toward indigenous (e.g. geothermal) and renewable energy resources will help reduce the need for electricity tariff increases in the longer term, possibly avoid the opportunity cost of fiscal expenditure on power subsidies, and make power more affordable. Renewable energy investment activity also lends itself to the creation of employment opportunities for women, improving their earning potential. Fiji must and will continue to invest in its electricity centre in a sustainable, inclusive and resilient manner.


Power to Rural Fiji –
A Low Carbon Approach to Rural Development 
Solar Panels Installed on Centralised Power Shed on Vio Island
The Fiji Rural Electrification Fund (‘FREF’) is a pioneering initiative of the Fijian Government stemming from Fiji’s COP23 presidency. With a goal to enable access to clean, renewable and affordable electricity to over 300 rural communities by 2036 and guided by high level representatives from the Fijian Government, FREF is using a revolving fund structure by which affordable tariff payments from rural communities will be placed into a trust fund used to electrify additional rural communities. 
Using an innovative approach to public private partnership and inclusive engagement with NGOs, FREF has partnered with Viti Renewables Pte Limited (a joint private venture between EFL and Sunergise Fiji) and  the Fiji Locally Managed Marine Area Network (FLMMA) to successfully complete Phase 1 of its community electrification programme that entails the electrification of Vio Island and the roll out of Phase 2 which entails the electrification of an additional 10 rural communities by early 2020.
Vio Island, off the coast of Lautoka is the first community to be electrified under this initiative, but it will certainly not be the last. Seed funding was received from the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation to electrify all 47 households on Vio Island that had no access to electricity and relied entirely on diesel gensets that not only were loud and created harmful fumes but was also expensive to fuel up and maintain. Following the electrification of Vio Island under the FREF, Vio Island now becomes the first ever Fijian community to have access to clean, renewable and affordable energy from a centralised micro-grid solar system. The village now has access to 24 hours of clean electricity, children can study under electric light as opposed to dull kerosene lamps and candles, community can now have access to broadcast media, internet services now be readily accessed and mobile phones can be charged effortlessly. This undoubtably has significantly empowered the community to be more productive and catalysed an improvement in standard of living across generations.   
The micro-grid system uses a centralised mini solar plant to which all 47 houses are connected to using smart meters. The smart meters enable FREF to remotely monitor the system, receive real-time usage data, run diagnostics and ensure that energy usage does not exceed feasible usage. Being the first village, Vio Village was hooked up to the system 6 months ago and has since been under a trial period during which all systems were successfully tested, certifications secured and an affordable interim tariff rate of FJ $18 per month set.
Subsequent to the completion of capital works on Vio Island under Phase 1, FREF has already commenced the process of electrifying 10 rural communities as part of phase 2 with partial funding from the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation and Government of UK. FREF still requires additional donor funding to reach the minimum number of electrified communities to have the revolving fund to become self-sufficient. FREF and the Fijian Government looks forward to additional bilateral, multilateral and philanthropic funding for this important initiative.
Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work 

for all
Current Status and Trends
It is often recognised that population dynamics underpin development needs. Fiji has a population of 884,887 with 50 percent of the population below the age of 27 years, just over 55 percent live in urban areas and a Labour Force Participation rate of 57.1 percent. A growing young population, rapid urbanization and low labour force participation are critical factors that shape Fiji’s policy decisions to rapidly increase youth employment through entrepreneurship and technical & vocational training, create jobs particularly in rural areas to increase rural economic opportunities and reduce rapid urban migration, enhance gender based economic opportunities to reduce low participation of women in the labour force and ultimately continue to sustain consistent economic growth.       
Fiji is experiencing its 10th successive year of consistent economic growth. Expansionary fiscal and investment policies coupled with prudent monetary policies have proven to be a successful formula for encouraging business in Fiji. Investment levels continue to be strong on the back of consistent state led investments in infrastructure development, ICT enhancement, affordable housing development and retail & service sector promotion in tandem with progressive structural reforms in regulatory environment, financial sector operations, land rights and redress mechanisms. While performance of primary industries are mixed, Fiji continues to develop its service and manufacturing sector by offering unique tourism products, back-office and ICT support services, niche garment production and bottled water exports. 
While Fiji continues to steer itself towards positive economic development, it is also cognizant of the need to ensure that there is inclusive and equitable share of economic benefits amongst its people. Between 2010 and 2017, Fiji achieved an average GDP per capita growth of 2.4% annually, which is 1.8 and 0.33 percentage points higher than the average of 0.6 percent and 2.07 percent annually it achieved between 2000-2010 and 19901999, respectively. This is noteworthy as Fiji has shown its economic resilience by maintaining growth despite devastating natural disasters in 2012 and 2016, the

 0 latter wiping out one-third of national GDP.  Moreover, Fiji’s GDP per capita growth between 2010 and 2017 is higher than the Pacific Small Island Countries average of 1.7% annually and the world average of 1.8% annually. 
An indicator of inclusive and equitable economic growth is reduction in unemployment rates. There has been a notable decline in the national unemployment rate from 8.6 percent in 2007 to 4.5 percent in 2017, the lowest in 20 years in combination with reduced income inequality.24 While national unemployment has continued to decline in 2017, female unemployment remains higher at 7.8 percent than male unemployment at 2.9 percent. Unemployment amongst Youth aged 15–24 years also remains high.
Minimum wage is a key factor to entice labour market participation and labour productivity. The Fijian Government has continued to gradually increase the minimum wage rate in a collaborative process without undermining the economic and business feasibility of wage increases. Fiji’s minimum wage was increased from FJ $2.00 to FJ $2.32 in 2015. In 2017 the national minimum was increased further to FJ $2.68 to assist over 100,000 workers who needed increased income. The national minimum wage is currently being reviewed again by the Ministry of Employment and Industrial Relations in line with current cost of living and specialized work fields. In addition to this, the Fijian Government also has specific minimum wages for 10 specialised sectors which is progressively higher than the national minimum wage.  The Fijian Government continues together with the Fiji National Provident Fund, Fiji’s national superannuation fund, continue to promote equal wages for females, youth and the disabled. 
Given that more than 13% of Fiji’s population registered at least some form of functional disability in 2017, disability inclusion in the labour force is crucial to not only ensure that no one is left behind but to also harness the maximum potential of Fiji’s work force. To encourage disability inclusion in employment, the Fijian Government has ongoing fiscal incentives that offer companies attractive tax holidays for employing the disabled. Moreover, welfare to workfare government initiatives also incorporate disability friendly assistance enabling entrepreneurship and craftsmanship amongst the disabled.
Tourism continues to be the backbone of Fiji’s economy. According to the estimation based on FBS’s tourism satellite account and World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC), Tourism’s direct contribution to Fiji’s GDP increased from 10.5 percent in 1995 to 14.4 percent in 2017. Total contribution to GDP, including both direct contribution and indirect contribution arising from multiplying effects from the direct tourism contribution, accounted for 40.3 percent of GDP in 2017. It is estimated that tourism direct contribution is going to increase to 16.1 percent of GDP by 2028, and total tourism contribution is to account for 39.3 percent of GDP in 2028. Tourism is also a significant contributor

to employment. The World Travel and Tourism Council estimated total contribution of travel and tourism to overall employment at 118,500 jobs or 36.5 percent of total employment in 2017, to be increased to 153,000 jobs or 43.7 percent of total employment by 2028.
Wealth management and maximization in society requires a well-functioning, agile and secure financial sector. This gives businesses more confidence to invest and enables employees to have savings and make wealth investments. Banking and financial services in Fiji have become more widely available resulting in more Fijians to utilise these services. Between 2004 and 2016, the number of ATMs significantly increased from 19 per 100,000 adult population to 53 per 100,000 adult population. This is mainly due to the emergence of more access points from non-traditional financial institutions, especially Micro Financial Institutions (MFIs) and Cooperatives. For the same period, the number of commercial bank branches increased from 9.3 per 100,000 population to 11.3 per 100,000 adult population.   
Gaps and Challenges 
While the Fijian economy is forecasted to experience continued growth, its high dependence ‐on its tourism sector is point of vulnerability as the tourism is elastic to various exogenous factors such as global economic downturns, adverse natural disasters particularly perpetuated by climate change, negative regional and domestic political situations and competition from other destinations. Moreover, its increasingly high dependence on imported fossil fuel is a threat to balance of trade which must be addressed to free up resources for investments in socio-economic development if Fiji is to grow at a much faster rate than other developing Asia and Pacific countries. 
High unemployment amongst youth and disproportionate unemployment amongst women limits Fiji from realizing its true economic potential. Minimum wages do not tend to fully reflect cost of living which must be delicately handled to not upset the cost of doing business in Fiji. Further perpetuating these problems are limited and irregular labour market information. 
There is room for further improvement in access and innovation in the banking and financial sector to offer attractive financing for entrepreneurship, youth, women and disability centric business development and green projects that will help achieve its low carbon ambitions.
Way Forward
There is an increasing need to diversify Fiji’s economic base to negate its high dependence on the Tourism sector. Opportunities are available to invest in niche businesses such as fresh juice manufacturing, value added product manufacturing of sugarcane waste, biomass plantation and supplying and mobile and web based application development and regional public transport manufacturing  and leasing. 
The possibilities for economic growth and subsequent employment creation are endless but this must be matched with an innovative flexible financial sector, responsive education system, enabling regulatory environment and seamless backstopping from development partners and International Financial Institutions for  blended financing and improved means of implementation. 
Young Minds Ushering Agricultural Innovation - The Youth 
Entrepreneurship SchemeMr. Rinesh Sharma, a young Fijian, is venturing into the agricultural business. This may not sound extraordinary at first but Mr. Sharma does not come from an agricultural family nor does he have any specialised qualifications in this field. He attained his engineering degree from India and knew he wanted to do something unique in life. He came across the idea of hydrophonics, a method of growing plants without soil by using mineral nutrient solutions and knew that it could be a great business in which he could apply his engineering expertise. 
Fiji where all year food security is a challenge due to vast differences in whether patterns perpetuated by erratic natural occurrence due to climate change and Mr. Sharma saw a 
business opportunity to only make profits but to help Fijians have access to reliable supply of agricultural produce for healthy living. He found out about the Fijian Government’s Youth Entrepreneurship Scheme (‘YES’) and put in a successful application which gave him FJ $20,000 in seed funding to start up his agricultural business, The IntroGreen Distribution.
Cognisant of a growing youth population and the need to create more youth employment, the Fijian Government began YES that provides seed capital and business development assistance to young individuals with unique business ideas and scalable business operations. The YES programme began in 2016-2017 by providing individual cash grants of up to FJ $30,000 to young Fijians below the age of 30 year. Due to the success of the scheme and the fact that 60 percent of the Fijian population were below the age of 40, the YES age criteria was increased to 40 years in 2018-2019. 
It even offers assistance to youth who do not have any formal qualification but have a implementable business idea or plan. This is being done to help marginalised youth to have a shot at success in life despite the hardships they face in life. Beneficiaries of the YES, have stated how the YES funding has helped them secure additional funding from financial institutions and other investors who see a degree of assurance when businesses have been selected for YES.  
Fijian Government plans to scale up this programme in the coming years based on the success rate of businesses that are currently benefiting from YES.       State led employment creation and inclusion programmes such the Youth Entrepreneurship Scheme and the Micro Small and Medium Enterprise Grants focusing on women must be enhanced in collaboration with non-state stakeholders. Minimum wages must be progressively reviewed without causing harm to business environment and a comprehensive and evolving Labour Market Information System must be developed and made accessible to policy makers, employers and the general public.  


Build Resilient Infrastructure, Promote Inclusive and Sustainable, Industrialisation and Foster InnovationCurrent Status and Trends
Fiji recognises the importance of investment in infrastructure 	which 	includes 	transport, 	power and 	energy, 	irrigation, 	industrialisation 	and 	ICT. Infrastructure plays a vital role in linking key socioeconomic sectors of the economy, including resource based industries, education and health. Development and 	investments 	in 	infrastructure, 	sustainable industrialisation and innovation are key indicators and drivers of economic growth in developing countries. Fiji through its investment in infrastructure, industry and innovation sectors, aims to foster a more inclusive, sustainable and resilient economic growth.  
Fiji has integrated SDG 9 into many aspects of the 5-Year & 20-Year National Development Plan (NDP), in particular infrastructure, telecommunication and financial services. To achieve these goals set out in the NDP, Fiji aims to implement government led sector targeted programs.

Environmentally Sustainable Energy Sector
The strong involvement of Government in the power sector over the years has resulted in approximately 90 percent of Fiji’s population having proper access to electricity. There has been an increase in grid extension programme to reach the remaining 10 percent that do not have access to electricity. Access to electricity increased from 69 percent in 2004 to 98 percent in 2016. As highlighted in the Fiji’s NDP, over 60 percent of the electricity generated is from renewable energy sources including hydro, biomass, wind and solar energy from which 50 MW of renewable energy generation capacity has been added in the last 10 years.
Efficient and Sustainable Transport Network
Fiji’s road network infrastructure/assets are estimated to be nearly FJ$11 billion, making it Fiji’s most valuably built asset. In transforming Fiji, a modern, safe and wellconnected road infrastructure is a necessity. Fiji has already embarked on modernising the infrastructure with substantial funding to improve roads, bridges, jetties, streetlights and footpaths over recent years. For example between 2013 and 2018, the government has allocated a total of more than FJ$3 billion on restoring, upgrading and building new roads, bridges and jetties through the Rural Roads Programme. This has allowed Fijians to be more connected through ensuring access between communities and essential services like Health and Education.
Given the geographical dispersion of islands, Fiji is also progressing towards improving inter-island sea transportation by increasing the number of vessel and improving the frequency of services provided to maritime areas. Moreover, Governments Shipping Franchise Scheme (SFS) provides monthly subsidy to shipping service operators to encourage cost-effective shipping services to outer islands that are considered to be in uneconomical routes. Additionally, due to the remoteness of some outer islands and the limited access to medical services, Government has also purchased a medical vessel to provide primary and secondary medical services and respond to medical emergencies in these areas. The Fijian Government is also working with the International Maritime Organisation to retrofit vessels servicing rural areas to reduce carbon emission.
Universal Access to Information and Competitive Telecommunication Services 
Efforts are continuing to transform Fiji into a regional hub for business, transport, communications and other services. Fiji has enabled efforts to adopt new and better technologies that have encouraged digital connectivity and improved productivity and service delivery. The Telecommunication sector has grown significantly since 2008, driven mainly by the deregulation of the telecommunication market which enabled the entry of private enterprises into the sector.
Fiji has relatively good telecommunication infrastructure, and this has been matched with the continued growth in mobile phone ownership and use throughout the years. This increase in phone ownership has translated to greater investment in modern ICT technology. This can be seen in Fi ji’s local mobile phone companies’ commitment to upgrading their networks to provide 4G technology. In 2013, Fiji pledged to achieve 100% mobile network coverage throughout the county. In 2016, 96% of the population in Fiji had access to at least a 3G network.
Building on Fiji’s advancement in telecommunication infrastructure, the Government is providing tax incentives and dedicating economic development zones to stimulate ICT development. The Fijian Government has also implemented numerous initiatives to enable improved access to telecommunication services, including the “Free WiFi Zone” initiative, the continued expansion of e-Government services, the Community Telecentre project, the One Laptop per Child initiative, the Universal Service Access project, etc. These initiatives enhance connectivity of Fijians to the outside world.
digitalFIJIdigitalFIJI is the Fijian Government’s DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION PROGRAMME. This programme is also known as the Digital 	Government 	Transformation (DGT) Programme. digitalFIJI is a 4-year programme to implement a number of government applications, enhance the overall ICT infrastructure and build and develop capacity in digital transformation in the government. The DGT programme is in line with the Fijian Government’s 5 year and 20-year National Development Plan (NDP) which calls for the steady improvement of the quality and accessibility of government services. One of the key goals of digitalFIJI 
is to make more key Government services available online and through mobile applications. The slate of applications being developed are targeted at key government services that are changing Fijian lives for the better, improve the ease of access, providing 24/7 availability and giving Fijians unlimited accessibility through the country, and all over the world. 
The following initiatives have been recently launched by the government, under the DGT programme:
• Birth Registration Mobile App -  Allowing new mothers and fathers to initiate the birth registration process electronically from the hospital or at home as opposed to going to the Birth, Death, Marriage Office.
• e-Profiles – Fijians are able to create an e-Profile under the digtalFIJI app, giving direct access to the Fijian Government’s e-services.
• Company Registry – Later in the year a company registry system will be made availalbe online which allow company searches to be done online 24/7 for the companies that have been digitized and verified.Fiji has been working towards improving the enabling environment to attract investors, reduce the cost of doing business and support private sector investments 

in the country.  Fiji is also expanding its Tourism industry with a focus on increasing source markets and also meeting the developing and diverse needs of tourists. Similarly the manufacturing and service sectors are also important industries the Government is efforts to support. 
Promoting Integrated Rural Development through InfrastructureResidents of Vakabuli – a rural community in Lautoka lived in fear of crossing the flooded Vakabuli - Paipai Irish Crossing every time storm clouds would gather, and heavy rain would fall. For nearly a decade members of the Vakabuli community were unable to transport farm produce to markets, school children and university students had to miss classes, the sickly were unable to go to hospitals, and funerals had to be cancelled all because of the Vakabuli crossing being far too dangerous to cross during adverse weather conditions.
That all came to an end, when the Prime Minister, Honourable Josaia Bainimarama, opened the new the Vakabuli - Paipai Bridge Crossing in January 2019 giving more than 150 households safe and reliable access to urban centres and essential services. The high engineering standards used on this bridge crossing will also be replicated in 17 other similar projects around Fiji to enhance the climate and disaster resilience of critical public infrastructure assets.
Approximately FJ $1.6 million Environment and Climate Adaptation Levy (ECAL) funds were used from the 2018-2019 allocation for the Vakabuli - Paipai Bridge Crossing project through the Upgrading and Replacement of Bridges programme administered by the Fiji Roads Authority. A total of FJ $20 million has been used from the ECAL in the 2018-2019 financial year to fund other similar projects under this programme.
The government has been using tax incentives to encourage investment in priority areas within the tourism and manufacturing sectors, such as the development of hotels and the development renewable and energy efficient technologies, etc. In 2016, the government implemented the “Made in Fiji” initiative to promote locally manufactured products, both within Fiji and internationally. As both the tourism and manufacturing sectors rely heavily on natural resources, Fiji is considering greening both its manufacturing and Tourism industries.
Promoting Entrepreneurial Culture through Sustainable Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises
Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) play a vital role in economic development in Fiji. MSMEs constitute approximately 97% of established businesses in Fiji, contribute to approximately 60% of employment, and account for around 12%-13% of Fiji’s GDP (Reserve Bank of Fiji, 2018). Since 2008, key Government initiatives such as the Northern Development Programme, the Integrated Human Resources Development Programme and Micro and Small Business Grant have formalised over 40,900 MSMEs from all parts of Fiji. To improve MSME’s access to finance, Government aims to increase the provision of finance available through Government funded programmes, such as the Micro and Small Business Grant, SME Credit Guarantee Scheme, 

Young Entrepreneurship Scheme and SME supporting assistance through the Fiji Development Bank. Through these initiatives more Fijians now have the opportunity to make their business aspirations and innovations a reality. 
Challenges and Way Forward
The country is burdened with the task to sustain economic growth and strengthen economic base, with a focus on increasing opportunities for low-income households, while building resilience to climate change impacts and natural disasters. The susceptibility of the country to shock is owed to its considerable distance from markets, a population dispersed across a large archipelago, high concentration of economic activities and settlements in coastal areas and exposure to natural disasters which are further worsened by the impacts of climate change. Many households in the country also continue to face hardships such as lack of access to improved sanitation, quality education and health care, and employment or income earning opportunities. 
Furthermore, the country is still heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels for electricity and transportation, which has had a negative effect on balance of payments, as the economy has expanded over the last decade. Fiji has the potential to achieve green growth through increasing renewable energy generation capacity, moving towards sustainable transport systems, and developing inclusive green towns and cities.
While the Government plans to support importation and use of fuel-efficient hybrid and electric vehicles to reduce fuel importation and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, it lacks an enabling environment for mobilizing investment. The Government can explore incentives and options for switching to less polluting options, while improving reliability, safety and accessibility. This requires examination of a number of integrated planning and technology options in a short period of time and significant investment, which evidently are constraining factors in reducing the transport sectors dependence on fossil fuels. 
The climatic conditions and natural disasters have a detrimental impact on Fiji’s infrastructure. According to an independent assessment conducted on bridges and crossings throughout Fiji, it was found that, out of the 524 bridges surveyed around the country, 31 were in need of immediate attention and repair. This issue is perpetuated by climate change and natural disasters, which continues to adversely affect road infrastructure. Fiji is also challenged with the financial constraints in maintaining transport infrastructure which has led to higher costs for transport operators and users. 
As a way forward there is a need for the Fijian Government to determine an appropriate model for financing the recurrent costs. Additionally there is ongoing support needed for developing sustainable transport plans policies and regulations to incentivize cleaner and inclusive transport and mobility options for 
Fiji. 
 
Reduce inequality within and among countries 
Current Status and Trends
Reduced inequalities is the cornerstone upon which the 5 Year and 20 Year National Development Plan (NDP) has been conceptualized. “Inclusive socioeconomic development” is at the heart of the NDP and is designed to empower every Fijian. This pillar of the NDP will ensure that all socio-economic rights in the Fijian Constitution are realised. Inclusivity is at the center of growth and development, and is being spread as widely as possible to improve the social well-being of all Fijians. The NDP envisions of no one being left behind regardless of geographical location, gender, ethnicity, physical and intellectual capability and social and economic status. The NDP ensures equality for all Fijians by incorporating measures which reduce unemployment, eradicate poverty, conduce 100% access to clean and safe water and electricity for all, enhance quality education and healthcare, empower women in development and address National security for all Fijians.   
Under the Fijian Constitution, all Fiji citizens are known as Fijians and have equal status and identity, thus being equally privileged to all rights and benefits of the Fijian citizenship. The Constitution is in itself reflective of the sincere advancement towards reduced inequalities for the diverse ethnic composition in Fiji and is evident that it has eliminated all possible forms of barriers, discrimination and inequalities for all Fiji citizens. 
Progressive Achievement and Sustaining Income Growth
Fiji experienced a reduction in income inequality from 2008 to 2013, according to World Bank estimates derived from the two Household Income and Expenditure Surveys (HIES) conducted by the Fiji Bureau of Statistics (FBS) over the period. Based on HIES data, Fiji’s Gini Index (a measure of income inequality) decreased from 40.4 in 2008 to 36.7 in 2013. Over the same period, the proportion of the population living in poverty fell from 31.0 percent to 28.0 percent. 
The Palma ratio is a more intuitive way of understanding income inequality. It measures the ratio of the income share of the top 10 per cent to the bottom 40 per cent of a country’s population. In more equal societies, this ratio will be 1 or below. Fiji’s latest Palma ratio, based on the 2013/14 Household Income and Expenditure Survey is 1.62. This is a significant improvement from 2.28 recorded in the 2008/09 HIES, indicating that the richest 40 10 per cent that used to make twice as 30 much income as the poorest 40 per cent 20 are now making less and indeed more 10 income is flowing into the poorest 40 0
per cent of households.
Empower and Promote Social, Economic and Political Inclusion 
Increased spending on well targeted social welfare programmes provides a safety net for the most vulnerable in our communities, our children, women and the elderly.  Fiji’s substantial investment to provide free education and improve health care facilities, as well as increase connectivity through better infrastructure and utilities has enhanced access and raised economic opportunities for all Fijians. To boost the productive capacity of our workforce, almost $4 billion in public spending has been directed towards the education sector since 2010. This spending has been towards policies that include free tuition for Year 1 to Year 13 students since 2014, hiring more teachers to improve the teacher-student ratio, free bus fares for students, free milk for Year 1 students, and merit-based student loan and scholarship programmes for tertiary students. The intention of these policies is to provide all students, particularly those from low-income families, with the skills to secure gainful employment and earn steady incomes, which will help reduce income inequality in the long run.
Equal Opportunities and Reduced Inequalities
The Fijian Civil Service has implemented the Open Merit based Recruitment and Selection process for staff recruitment and selection which appoints staff purely on the ability to do the job, assessed against objective selection criteria which does not discriminate against or give preference to any group or individual. This is also a clear demarcation of giving equal opportunities to the people of Fiji. In addition, the Equal Employment Opportunity Policy aims to create a fair working environment by eliminating all forms of discrimination at the workplace. 
The Fiji National Disability Policy 2008-2018, provides a framework for addressing disability in Fiji and to develop a more ‘inclusive’ society, create greater awareness of the needs of people with disabilities and identify priority areas for action to dismantle barriers hindering the full participation of people with disabilities in the social and economic life of Fiji.
Gini Index and National Poverty Rate, 2008- 2013
The launch of the Fiji National Gender Policy in 2014 was further evident of Fiji’s commitment in promoting gender equality in Fiji. This fundamental policy aims to improve the quality of life of men, women, boys and girls, at all levels of society through the promotion of gender equity and equality and promote active and visible gender mainstreaming in all sectors and within civil society to ensure agency for gender equity and equality in all spheres of national life. It also aims to remove all forms of gender inequality and gender discrimination in 
Fiji.
Fiscal, Wage and Social Protection Policies for Greater Equality
The reduction in poverty and inequality is also evidential of the positive redistributive policies and progressive tax systems in Fiji that lessens the tax burden on the poor. Through reforms of the Fiji taxation system, raising the income tax threshold to FJ$30,000 is a milestone achievement that has significantly increased the takehome pay for low income households. Reduction in Value Added Tax (VAT) from 15% to 9% has reduced overall costs to Fijians. Likewise, reduction in duty on essential items including items for the disability puts more purchasing power in the hands of ordinary and marginalized Fijians.  
Fiji has also regulated its national minimum wage via the Employment Relations Regulation 2017, thus ensuring at all Fijians are able to benefit from this national right and are not left for exploitation at the hands of the employers.  A key objective of the National Minimum Wage Policy is the protection of workers who are the most vulnerable in our society, i.e. the unskilled. These are workers who are isolated by trade unions and who do not have any bargaining power. There has been a steady and progressive growth in the National minimum wage from $2.00 per/hour to $2.32 per/hour in 2015 and this has further increased to $2.68 per/hour in the year 2017. 
Financial Inclusiveness
Financial Inclusion indicators captured by the Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF), which can be defined as the proportion of the population that uses financial services, is also critical for determining the reduction in inequality, poverty and promoting inclusive economic growth. The RBF measures financial inclusion in terms of access to and usage of financial services. Supply-side indicators show that the number of cash-in and cashout access points grew significantly between 2010 and 2016. The huge increase is due to the proliferation of ATMs and EFTPOS terminals, and the emergence of non-traditional access points such as mobile money services and microfinance institutions.  
To further improve financial inclusiveness and to strengthen the financial education for the most vulnerable in Fiji and the Pacific, the Pacific Financial Inclusion Programme (PFIP), administered by the UN Capital Development Fund and the United Nations Development Programme through Bilateral Partner Funding, has helped more than two million low-income Pacific Islanders gain access to formal financial services and financial education.  PFIP’s objective is to increase the number of low-income Pacific Islanders who adopt formal financial services and achieves this objective by supporting financial service providers to innovate with products and services for mass market customers, supporting governments to create an enabling policy environment for financial innovation, and empowering consumers.  PFIP has funded projects with financial service providers who have innovated with technology and products, enrolling over two million customers in services such as agency banking, mobile wallets, micro insurance, micro loans, remittances and savings groups. Women account for 976,216 of the total clients enrolled, representing significant progress in reducing the gender gap that exists in the Pacific. At the same time, PFIP works with financial regulators in the region to develop an enabling environment for financial innovation.
Enhanced Representation and Voice for Developing Countries
Fiji has taken a lead role in voicing out concerns and views in relation to various critical issues in relation to economic growth, sustainable development and climate change in the international arena. Fiji has hosted the first ever high level United Nations Oceans Conference in June 2019, following a consensus decision by the UN General Assembly in 2015. The Swedish government has co-hosted this event with Fiji. 
Fiji also attained presidency of COP23 and were identified as champions in the fight against climate change. From the start of its Presidency of COP23, Fiji has been engaged in pursuing outcomes that will assist Fiji and the Pacific in dealing with climate change. In addition, Fiji, in its role as President of the COP23 negotiations in Bonn, guided progress on certain key aspects of the negotiations and oversaw the launch of a number of new initiatives. Fiji is also represented in the Adaptation Fund Board which provides greater opportunity to advocate for climate change and adaptation related projects within the Pacific region.   
Fiji’s representation in the international arena is also evident through hosting of the 52nd Annual General Meeting of the Asian Development Bank Board of Governors. This enabled a platform to discuss issues that ranged from sustainable tourism, the role of private sector financing for disaster risk management and climate resilience, and the importance of actions to improve ocean health. Further, Fiji has assumed the Chairmanship of the World Bank’s Small States Forum and has pledged to continue its advocacy for climate action, accessible climate finance and oceans preservation.
Safe and Responsible Migration and Mobility of People
The Fiji National Employment Centre (NEC) also facilitates transition of unskilled workers from Fiji to work abroad. The NEC works at a government to government level with signed MOUs that govern how the seasonal workers programmes are implemented. The NEC is also responsible for Foreign Employment Service (FORES) which facilitates overseas employment (both seasonal and short-term) and ensuring circular migration.
Gaps and Challenges 
There are several indicators under SDG 10 which make progress measurement quite difficult. For some indicators, the data is already captured through surveys conducted however there are significant time lags between the latest available data and the current period. It is equally important to assess future trends and analysing the level of inequality with minimal reliance on past data. Assessing future rates of inequality is strongly influenced by the opportunities that citizens have to improve their living standards today. Ensuring that there is equality of opportunity in education and work across different geographical locations, gender, age groups, etc. is a more productive focus for policy makers. 
Way Forward
Eliminating Inequalities through Financial InclusionThrough Pacific Financial Inclusion Program (PFIP) support, Vodafone Fiji has been able to deploy over 300 Mobile Village Agents – small shops or canteens in villages where Fijians are able to transact in their community.  This reduces the cost of travel and brings banking and remittances straight to the communities. At their corner shop, they can deposit, withdraw or receive money from relatives aboard. Vodafone Fiji’s MPAiSA platforms, currently has many user cases that’s helping improve the lives of Fijian.  MPAiSA is now linked to HFC Bank – so customers can easily bank at the shops and can also top up their MPAiSA account which is now used to pay for electricity, top up their bus cards (e-transport), make payments for their hire purchase accounts, school fees and even make voluntary contributions as low as $7 into their FNPF accounts (save for retirement).  Having electricity means that rural communities can now buy items like refrigerators to help keep fish fresher for fisherman, women can buy washing machines that reduces their workload at home and children are able to study longer at night.  Electricity also brings improved home security and longer trading hours for small businesses.
While traditionally inequality is measured on the grounds of income, it equally important to view the ideology of inequality more holistically which encompasses various other issues. Thus, it is important to capitalize on the quality and coverage of existing infrastructure for IT, transportation, health services, electricity and education to reach the remotest of the regions thus bringing equal opportunities to a greater number. Existing guiding policies and governing documentation pertaining to social security and welfare to be strengthened in order to ensure that it addresses pertinent current issues which affect majority of the vulnerable population.  

Current Status and Trends
Fiji has identified “Sustainable Cities and Towns” as a strategic priority area in its National Development Plan, aiming to deal with the issue of rapid urbanisation and the associated problems that have consequently emerged. These include, but are not limited to, inadequate provision of urban infrastructure and services, informal settlements, housing affordability, urban poverty, traffic congestion, and waste management. The Plan explicitly set up the target of increasing home ownership to 50% of the households by 2021, reducing urban poverty and improving access to basic services. 
According to the 2017 Census, 55.9% of Fiji’s population reside in urban areas – an increase from 50.7% in 2007. This is attributed to movement of people from rural to urban areas and extension of town boundaries. At this speed, urban population is likely to reach more than 60% of the population by 2030. Rising urban population has led to the conversion of open space and farmland for residential, commercial, office, or other developed land uses. Since 1999, the area of Suva City has been growing at 1.3% annually. As a result, the City now is 25% bigger than what it was in 1999. 
In 2017, more than three quarter of the Fijian households owned houses, while the remaining one quarter of households are rented from private landlords or the public rental boards or live in government or institution buildings. However, many of the houses are built on land with insecure ownership. During the same year, 15% of the households lived in buildings with insecure land ownership. This figure is particularly high in urban areas, with 25% of the urban households living in buildings with insecure land ownership, where many of these households live in informal settlements. It is estimated that between 110,000 – 140,000 people live in about 200 informal settlements around the country, accounting for nearly 30% of urban population or 16% of total population. These informal settlements are characterized by poor quality housing, insecurity of land tenure, lack of access to basic services such as piped water, sanitation, and electricity, as well as higher poverty rate. 
Purchasing a home is the single biggest financial commitment most Fijians make in their lifetime. To improve accessibility of affordable housing, a Housing Facility has been set up with the objectives to improve access to housing finance for low-income earners through the Housing Authority, commercial banks, licensed credit institutions and Fiji Development Bank. In rural areas, Housing Assistance program has been implemented to provide rural communities and individuals with housing assistance. The government has also provided tax incentives to encourage private sector investment in residential housing development. Additionally, the Government has introduced a First Home Owners Buyer Programme where a grant of FJ $10,000 is given to all Fijians who wish to purchase their first home. 
For households living in poverty, Fiji has set up the Housing Assistance Relief Trust (HART) to provide financial assistance to accommodate destitute families in low cost housing settlements. For people living with disabilities, the government has provided funding to develop more inclusive and disability friendly buildings to meet their needs. To tackle the issues associated with informal settlements, the government has implemented programs supporting the upgrade and redevelopment of informal settlements with basic utilities such as piped water supply, electricity, and proper sanitation and waste management facilities. In certain cases, where it was necessary, the government has provided funding to assist the relocation of people living in informal settlements.
While urban planning and management capacities have been strengthened through provisions of capital grant and town council support, budget funding has been made available for numerous schemes that support rapid urban growth within the economy in context of township development. This is being done to transform rural areas into townships that have similar opportunities and amenities as urban centres. 
Rising urban populations put strain on waste management. Waste generation has major implications for public health and the environment. It is estimated that of the 180 thousand tons of solid waste generated, only 70% of them are collected and the remaining 30% are illegally dumped. In the case of outer islands, there are no waste collection services. In 2017, 97.6% of the waste collected were land-filled, and only less than 0.4% were recycled. The government has financed the construction of new landfill spaces and waste transfer stations; implemented the annual National Clean-up Campaign to promote public awareness about littering in public places; have standardised roadside rubbish bins; and has established legal framework to encourage recycling of beverage containers.
People in Fiji in general have convenient access to public transport. According to a 2009 report by Fiji Land Transport Authority, 95% of the population in Fiji have easy access to public transport. Private cars and taxis are also important vehicles for travel. In 2017, Fiji had 84,558 registered private cars, 10,019 taxis and rental cars, and 2,444 public buses. Over the last 3 years, the government has invested approximately $1.4 billion for sustainable transportation that includes improving road infrastructure, drainage systems, and footpaths to schools and hospitals, all of which considers people with disabilities. 
In relation to safe and inclusive communities, especially pertaining to violence against women and children, the government has implemented a Zero Tolerance Violence Free Community programme, which aims to empower and educate the communities in taking action to stop violence in their communities. Moreover, to improve rural community buildings, the government has funded the building of Rural Sports Complexes.
In terms of disaster risk management, the National Disaster Management Office has installed tsunami sirens in 13 locations around the Capital as part of its ongoing commitment towards improving its state of readiness for any tsunami event. 
Gaps and Challenges
Rapid urbanisation brings with it significant social and economic challenges for the government including the conversion of open space and farmland for residential, commercial, office, or other developed land uses; inadequate infrastructures, in particular for informal settlements, including lack of power supply, inadequate water supply and sanitation, waste management, and some basic amenities; lack of affordable housing; increasing waste generation; and high unemployment and poverty in urban informal settlement.
The issues identified in the 2007 Urban Policy Action Plan are still relevant today, including haphazard urban growth, limited local government capacity, inadequate provision of affordable formal new housing lot subdivisions, rapidly growing squatter and other informal settlement areas, and underserviced periurban areas. These issues requires integrated urban planning and development.
Increasing the resilience of informal urban settlements 
More than half of Fiji’s population live in urban areas (2 cities and 10 towns) and this number is fast increasing. There has been an increase in the number and density of informal settlements in Fiji. During the 2016 Tropical Cyclone Winston, damages in urban informal settlements were particularly severe. Increasing the resilience of informal urban settlements in Fiji that are highly vulnerable to climate change and disaster risks is Fiji’s first Adaptation Fund project that targets 16 most vulnerable settlements which have an estimated 1,249 dwellings and a total population of 6,242. Implemented by the UN-Habitat and a local Ministry, the project combines horizontally and vertically interrelated resilience strengthening of institutions, communities and physical, natural and social assets and ecosystems. The specific needs of women, indigenous people, people with disabilities and youth are being considered at all stages of the project.There is a shortage of affordable quality housing and housing lots for many families who wish to migrate into the urban areas. This situation is likely to get worse as urbanisation increases.  As a result, many low-income households live in poor conditions in informal settlements, which typically lack access to basic services, such as electricity, water and sanitation, and are susceptible to various environment hazards and disasters. The government is tackling problems associated with informal settlements through various policies and programs aimed at improving living conditions. 
To increase the climate and disaster resilience of urban infrastructure, more effort is required to improve urban adaptation planning, and to take into account long term climate projections in urban planning processes to ensure climate-resilient infrastructure. 
Finally, as Fiji’s economic performance improves with urbanisation and population growth, the increased activities in all sectors will ultimately lead to increased waste generation. 
Way Forward
Fiji, in its efforts to achieve SDG 11 and create vibrant and sustainable urban centres, aims to focus on strategies for better urban development, identification and development of future growth centres, town boundary extension, proper urban waste management, beautification, disaster planning and awareness, upgrading and relocation of informal settlements and improved traffic management.
A review of the 2007 Urban Policy Action Plan (UPAP) will be undertaken to promote institutional reforms so as to support a more efficient, effective and sustainable urban development that would contribute to the social, economic and environmental development of Fiji. Fiji is also in the process of reviewing and updating National Housing Act.
Fiji, in its long term vision of keeping up with increased modernisation and rapid growth aims to develop smaller urban centres in the quest to relieve pressure on basic infrastructure and the environment in urban centres. The government has also been promoting integrated urban planning which includes development of urban planning and Urban Growth Management Plans. In the 2018-2019 financial year, Government aims to commence work on master plans for the Greater Suva Area (GSA) and Nadi region through its urban planning programme.
              

SDG 12: SUSTAINABLE 
CONSUMPTION AND 
PRODUCTION
Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns

Current Status and Trends 
Fiji, as a developing island state, is continuously working towards sustainably achieving economic growth whilst ensuring the ecological footprint of consumption and production of goods and resources are significantly minimised. This is the vision of Goal 12, which explores the principle of sustainable consumption and production (SCP) patterns. 
Energy consumption, availability and renewables: Per capita energy consumption has increased substantially over the past 10 years, largely due to increased access to electricity and market demand. Much of this demand has been met by non-renewable resources. However, energy efficiency has increased and plans are in place to increase renewable sources of electricity above the current 66%.
Solid waste: Waste management, recycling and collection 	is 	improving, 	but 	currently 	collection and recycling rates do not keep up with increasing generation rates. Only 80% of waste generated makes it to landfills. Most landfills lack segregating facilities for separation of recyclables and hazardous waste, and in many cases, waste is still burnt.
Fiji has implemented many initiatives to improve efficient production and consumption. For example, Fiji has implemented the Minimum Energy Performance Standards and Labelling scheme to ensure the deployment of energy efficient technologies. The Fiji government has also set up tax incentives to encourage the use of renewable energy and energy efficient technology. Additionally the building code and standards are being reviewed and updated to comply with energy efficient principles. Many tourism operators have also deployed energy efficient technology and practices in their businesses. Similarly, the Water Authority of Fiji has set up targets to improve water use efficiency and has conducted national campaigns on water conservation.
The 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns
In 2012, Fiji joined other countries in adopting the 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns (10YFP) during the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20). This document has been instrumental in providing overarching guidance on global action taken towards SCP. 
In alignment to the 10YPF, Fiji has incorporated the principles of sustainable consumption and production patterns into its key national policies. Concepts such as resource efficiency and green economy are reflected in the Green Growth Framework for Fiji (GGF). This is further echoed in Fiji’s 5 Year and 20 Year National Development Plan (NDP), which emphasises, the need for environmentally sustainable food production to ensure inclusive socio-economic development. The Fiji National Adaptation Plan (2018) also supports efforts to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns. It seeks to enhance the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources. It also seeks to improve waste management including reducing waste generation. 
A recent study of Fiji’s development minerals, which consists of mainly gravel, sand and stone, revealed that the actual volume extracted were eight times higher than officially reported figures and seven times the value reported (UNDP, 2018). The study helped shed light on the true levels of natural resource consumption in the country, and in the process raised the awareness of the Fijian Government to commit due attention and care to effectively monitor natural resource extraction for the sustainable development of the country and for the benefit of Fijians.
International Commitments
In addressing hazardous waste, there are 4 main international multilateral environment agreements, namely the Montreal Protocol, Basel Convention, Stockholm Convention and the Rotterdam Convention. 
Fiji has ratified the Montreal Protocol and has since developed regulations (e.g. Ozone Depleting Substances Act 1998) to assist in achieving its commitment under this convention. In 2013, Fiji successfully reached its target in eliminating production and consumption of ozone depleting chemicals through better cross border control. The Fijian Government continues to be committed towards the protection of the earth through better protection of the ozone layer and as such, is working towards ratifying the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol. 
In addition to this, Fiji has also ratified (June 20, 2001) the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollution. Since its ratification, the Fijian Government has also developed a plan (National Plan for Implementation of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants in Fiji Islands, 2006) to aid in achieving its commitment under this convention. 
Fiji is working towards To date, Fiji is yet to ratify the Basel Convention and the Rotterdam Convention. 
Agricultural Production
Resilience to climatic conditions is relatively high for traditional crops and production systems. However food production systems have become more vulnerable to climate variability threatening food security in Fiji. In the last 16 years the agriculture sector has suffered damages and losses from cyclones and floods amounting to about FJ$791 million. Cyclones cause destruction to crops, trees, farming and fishing infrastructure. In particular Cassava which is one of the main subsistence cash crops in Fiji is highly sensitive to tropical cyclones. Floods also have detrimental effects causing crop damage due to inundation. These damages lead to negative impacts on productivity and thus implications for food security and economic loss. 
In light of long term impacts of climate change, increased 

shoreline erosion and inundation and reduced surface water, represent a major threat to food production in low lying areas. 
Waste Management
Currently, a National Solid Waste Management Strategy guides the efforts undertaken in Fiji to address sustainable solid waste management.
As part of efforts to reduce plastic pollution, the Fijian government has introduced a tax on retail use plastic bags. This levy of 20 cents is part of the Environment and Climate Adaptation Levy that is used to fund environment and climate change related projects in Fiji. As of mid-2018, the tax on plastic bags has collected over FJ$3 million. Further to this, the Fijian Government is working towards phasing out single-use plastics. 
To improve waste recycling, several    major  bottling companies  have  established  collection  and  recycling systems  with  civil  society  and  community initiatives, mainly focused on promoting civic responsibility and specific clean-up campaigns in urban centres.
According to Fiji’s Experimental Environmental Account, solid waste generation increased by nearly 20% between 2006 and 2016, increasing from 150 thousand tons in 2006 to nearly 180 thousand tons in 2017. The data clearly reflects the opening of the Naboro landfill that services 5 municipalities (It is also the first sanitary landfill in the country). Solid waste that would otherwise have been left at dumpsites is now disposed using international best practice standards for landfilling waste. 
Fiji recognises that there are challenges that need to be addressed in confronting solid waste management. As better practice for disposal is implemented, innovative procedures are needed that encourages more recycling and re-using of materials that eventually translates in reducing the amount of waste that is disposed. On this note, Fiji’s National Development Plan sets out plans for a Waste Management Authority that will ensure that waste management is efficient, effective and financially viable. 
Fiji, and Suva City, in particular, has achieved important improvements in SWM in recent years. The new landfill

in  Naboro has significantly reduced environmental and public health risks. Waste collection services provided by the SCC are reasonably efficient, well-managed, and financially  self-sustaining.
Challenges and Way Forward
The key challenges for Fiji in implementing SDG12 is the limited public awareness on the importance of sustainable consumption and production practices. At the consumption end, there is a need for improved consumer awareness, building and shaping sustainable habits, and enabling or encouraging more sustainable choices. Due to the non-existence of a sustainable consumption and production strategic plan and accompanying policies to govern economic actors, effectively monitoring and regulating consumption and production patterns continue to be a challenge. 
Switch and SaveThe Consumer Council of Fiji has been able to secure funding for the Consumer International (CI) initiated campaign, funded through the CI’s Green Action Fund and the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation (SSNC) on sustainable consumption, focusing on promoting energy-saver bulbs under the campaign slogan “Switch and Save”. The Council also carried out and extensive research on the Energy Saver light bulbs. An issue paper was developed and a factsheet was also designed 
In ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns among consumers, the Council continues to carry out rigorous research and awareness campaigns on sustainable consumption

Consumer Council of Fiji Implementation of SDG Submission (2019)Moreover, illegal dumping and burning of wastes continue to be problems due to inadequate enforcement. Recent amendments to the Litter Decree 2010 have helped to deter littering through the imposition of onthe-spot fines. Key priorities for strengthening the management of solid waste will be greater efforts to promote recycling, particularly through the planned introduction of a container deposit scheme. The proposed new transfer station will also support improved recycling efforts by reducing the volume of recyclables that enter the landfill

SDG 13: Climate Action 
Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts
Current Status and Trends 
As a small island country, Fiji is one of the countries most affected by the impacts of climate change. Combatting climate change for Fiji is primarily in the context of building resilience and adaptive capacity which is the first overriding priority in light of the climate impacts Fiji is exposed to.  Fiji has high exposure to multiple natural hazards, including tropical cyclones, storm surge, severe storm, flooding, landslide, drought and extreme temperatures. According to the Climate Vulnerability Assessment (CVA), between 2000 and 2016, a total of 41 climate related disasters occurred in Fiji, which have resulted in a total of 237 deaths, affecting 1.6 million Fijians, and causing a total loss of FJ $3.2 billion. Moreover, Tropical cyclone and flood losses also translate into an average of 25,700 Fijians being pushed into poverty every year (CVA, 2017). What is concerning is that climate change is expected to amplify these risks, threatening the development objectives of the country’s Development Plan and affecting daily livelihoods of the Fijian people. 
Fijian Action
Fiji’s commitment for climate action is demonstrated through the ratification of many relevant international policies and conventions. Fiji was the first country to ratify the Paris Agreement and has also been a signatory party to other relevant international conventions, such as the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, Convention for Biological Diversity, Hyogo Framework for Action and Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. Fiji’s COP 23 Presidency and Co-Presidency of the First United Nations Oceans Conference in 2017 was an important stride in the endeavor to seek climate justice for not only Fijians but the Pacific as a whole. More so, it has enabled Fiji to create awareness of the ocean and its importance for sustaining livelihoods in Small Island Developing States. Thus, the Ocean Pathway launched under the Fijian Presidency at COP23 calls for Oceans to be an integral part of the UNFCCC processes recognizing that oceans play a crucial role in regulating earth’s climate as well as the link between healthy ocean and its role in mitigating the impacts of climate change on already vulnerable Pacific Island Countries.
Climate Change Adaptation 
Recognizing that climate change is a perplexing development challenge of the this era, Fiji has committed much effort in reforms, strategies and policy shifts  to better understand and mitigate the impacts of climate change and natural hazards. Fiji’s National Development Plan (NDP) is aligned to the Paris Agreement and mainstreams climate change in all areas of development. Moreover, it is realised that if Fiji is to achieve the objectives and targets set out in its NDP then it must adapt, underlying the importance of achieving SDG 13 as a precursor to achieving the other SDGs. In  response  to  national  needs to build resilience of all Fijians and international  commitments,  the  Fijian Government  has  prepared  a  National  Adaptation Plan (NAP) 2018. Through the NAP Fiji has identified 160 adaptation measures to be prioritised over the five-year period of the NAP. The actions chosen have benefits for climate resilience, but also have additional benefits in terms of development outcomes. 
Fiji has made significant efforts to reduce climate and disaster risks, better prepare for natural disasters, and respond to major shocks. The Fijian Government spending on investments to strengthen resilience has significantly increased from 3.74 percent of the total budget in 2013 to 9.85 percent in the 2016-17 fiscal years (CVA, 2017). This has been invested on the rehabilitation of flood retention dams, constructing protection barriers against coastal erosion, conducting environment impact assessment to mitigate flood risks, strengthening of the early warning system and the installation of water level and rainfall telemetry instrument in all hydrological stations to effectively monitor the river levels.  Among these different approaches, communities have also had to be relocated due to the effects of climate change with the first ever relocation of an entire village in 2014. Community relocation is a relatively new response to the effects of climate change for Fiji and is one that is viewed as an option of last resort. Apparently, more than eighty communities have been earmarked by the Government for potential future relocation. Permanent relocation stands to preserve the livelihoods, avoid tragedy, save lives and prevent social disruption as vulnerable communities continue to be threatened by sea-level rise, inundation of tides, increased intensity of storm surges, and coastal erosion  and extreme weather events such as cyclones. To ensure that relocation efforts are well guided, Fiji has devised a Planned Relocation Guideline (PRG) 2018. This will enable the Fijian Government to effectively respond to climate induced relocation needs, ensuring that the well-being and rights of the vulnerable members of any community being relocated is also well protected. 
To better understand the extent of Fiji’s vulnerability to the impacts of climate change and to better prepare and manage the associated risks, the Fijian Government conducted the Climate Vulnerability Assessment (CVA), and is in the process of developing a National Disaster Risk Reduction Plan. 
Fiji has also partnered with the ADB and the GCF to fund an Urban Water Supply and Wastewater Management Investment Program to benefit more than 300,000 Fijians living in the Greater Suva Area. The project is expected to be completed in July 2025 and represents a total investment of US $405 million. This project exemplifies the urgent need to boost the resilience of our water supply and wastewater infrastructure to withstand severe weather events. This is the largest climate investment project in Fiji which sets a promising tone for more blended funding initiatives in the future. 
The Fijian Government has also established a Ministry of Waterways to address the growing threat that flooding poses to Fijian communities, a threat that is projected to worsen due to the effects of climate change. The Ministry is responsible for the maintenance of drainage systems and management of waterways in Fiji, including creeks, tributaries and rivers. In its work to improve storm-water management, mitigate flooding and improve irrigation, the Ministry will incorporate aspects of hydrological forecasting, drainage surveillance and realignment, waterway dredging and river-embankment management.
Climate Change Mitigation 
Despite the fact that the country contributes a mere 0.006 percent of global emissions, Fiji has shown its commitment to the Paris Agreement with an ambitious Nationally Determined Commitments (NDCs) of 30 percent reduction in energy sector emissions. Fiji’s current Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) is specific to the energy sector both in terms of a greenhouse gas (GHG) baseline, with 2013 as the reference year, and in terms of potential mitigation actions. The overall mitigation target in the NDC is to reduce CO2 emissions by 30% from a BAU (Business As Usual) baseline scenario in 2030, 10% of which is unconditional and achieved through implementation of the Green Growth Framework for Fiji 2014, while 20% is conditional on external funding estimated at USD 500 million in 2015. The 30% emission target will be achieved by striving to reach 100% renewable energy power generation and through economy-wide energy efficiency. Fiji devised the NDC Implementation Roadmap with the support of the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) to operationalize Fiji’s NDC commitment. The Fijian Government is currently working with the GGGI to develop bankable investment proposals for the interventions and investments outlined in the NDC Roadmap.

An aerial shot of the solar panels on the roof of the Coca-Cola Amatil Fiji’s manufacturing facility. A great example of private sector initiative in Climate Action.Recognising Fiji’s promising renewable energy potential and the ambitious renewable energy target, Fiji launched the Fiji Rural Electrification Fund program on the margins of its COP23 Presidency, working in cooperation with the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, Sunergise, the Fiji Locally Managed Marine Area Network and Energy Fiji Limited. The fund is a non-profit and charitable organisation aimed at facilitating investments in renewable energybased power generation in Fiji, which will support the socio-economic development of the country and enable the use of renewable energy resources and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Fiji. At present the fund has provided upfront capital cost bringing in clean and renewable energy to off-grid communities in Fiji, with Vio Island just off the coast of Fiji’s mainland Viti Levu being one of the first communities to be electrified under the FREF program.
Furthermore, Fiji has achieved its NDP target of developing a mid-century long-term low GHG emission development strategy which is also in accordance with Article 4, paragraph 19, of the Paris Agreement. The overall aim of the Fiji’s Low Emission Development Strategy is to enhance the Fijian Government’s ability to plan for decarbonization of its economy in the longterm by providing a framework and a pathway for a progressive revision and enhancement of targets under its NDC to reduce CO2 emissions to 2030 and beyond. The overall impact of the project is that Fiji will continue to take the lead in setting a pathway to a low carbon future and will be able to effectively plan to reduce its GHG emissions and contribute to the implementation of the Paris Agreement.
Climate Finance
Fiji has completed a Climate Public Expenditure and Institutions Review (CPEIR) 2015, to examine how public and private climate change and disaster risk management-related expenditures are integrated into national budgetary processes and how this process can be improved to attract more climate finance from both domestic and international sources also exemplifying how to better utilize it. 
Fiji is also seeking to increase climate financing from both domestic and international sources. Domestically, Fiji has increased the rate of ‘Environment & Climate Adaptation Levy’ (ECAL) from 6 percent to 10 percent to mobilize more finance for climate change related projects. The revenue from ECAL is deposited into a dedicated bank account and solely used to fund climate adaptation and green projects. The participation of the private sector in Climate Change and Disaster Risk Management related activities has also been encouraged through both policy advocacy and tax incentives. For example there is a 55 percent tax incentive for any purchase of electric vehicles and also as a complementary measure, the minimum capital investment for setting up of electric vehicle charging stations has been reduced two fold to pave a pathway towards a low carbon future.  
Fiji is also exploring new financing mechanisms for climate financing. In 2017, Fiji issued the Fiji Sovereign Green Bond, the first developing country green bond, raising FJ$100 million for climate resilience actions. The proceeds from the bond has been utilized in financing the rural water supply programme, rainwater harvesting programme, rehabilitation and construction of schools damaged by Tropical Cyclone Winston, emergency works, rural electrification programme and construction of landfill. Fiji’s Green Bond is largely adaptationfocused, with 90.6% of spending on adaptation-centric projects and 9.4% spending on mitigation-centric projects.   
Fiji also acquired direct access to Green Climate Fund (GCF) through the accreditation of the Fiji Development Bank. This is the first development bank in the Pacific region to be a “direct access entity” for up to and including US $10 million for an individual project or an activity within a programme. Currently initiatives are ongoing for the development of three project proposals to access the fund allocation. Fiji also underwent a Legal Readiness for Climate Finance which was a major study supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to assess the barriers that exist in accessing global public finance and attracting private sector finance in climate action. This will ultimately enable the country to better prepare to access and manage climate finance. 
Challenges and Way Forward 
Fiji is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and faces some of the most devastating consequences of climate change. Climate related disasters have already had substantial impacts on all aspects of Fiji’s social and economic development despite being one of the smallest contributors to global carbon emissions. Consequently, Fiji’s action itself would contribute very little to tackle the climate change problem, emphasizing global collective actions are required to effectively deal with climate related issues.
While progress has been made and Fiji has strategies for how to meet adaptation and mitigation ambitions, challenges remain in accessing resources because of capacity constraints. As a small developing country, Fiji has limited financial resources available for climate actions not to mention the significant economic losses Fiji incurs due to natural disasters. For example, Fiji suffers an average annual asset losses of F $500 million from natural disasters which is more than 5 percent of the GDP and is concerning since the prospect that climate change related disasters are likely to increase in the future. Moreover the Climate Vulnerability Assessment of the country reveals that the Fijian Government will require about F $ 9.3 billion which is almost 100% of GDP, in investment over the next 10 years to strengthen resilience. 
Consequently, Fiji may have to seek climate finance from all potential sources and further explore blended finance options. While the government encourages the participation of private sector investment in adaptation and mitigation projects, private sector investment is still limited due to low returns and high investment risks in this area. Fiji may have to explore workable models and develop targeted policies for promoting private sector investment. It will be worthwhile, however lacking due to limited capacity, to investigate innovative ways of making climate change projects bankable. This may involve accurately assessing risks and finding solutions to minimize these risks, and creating practical finance models. Moreover, what will be important for Fiji is to create an enabling environment to fully capitalize from carbon market mechanisms which though is mitigation centric, contributes towards adaptation co-benefits. 
Given the on-going focus on building resilience, the Fijian Government has seen it fit to consider tapping the disaster insurance market as a potential means of building up capacity and contingencies for postdisaster financing. Preliminary consultations have been undertaken with the World Bank on a potential financing mix and appropriate modality. As a way forward having an insurance cover could increase our financial resilience against natural disasters that is by improving our financial capacity to meet post-disaster funding needs (Green Growth Framework, 2015). Moreover building capacity within the domestic insurance industry to provide catastrophe risk insurance for buildings will help to reduce the rebuilding cost faced by the Government and private households while providing incentives to ensure that building codes are followed and assets are maintained to an insurable quality.
Additionally to implement the climate action plans and strategies and to adopt the technologies proposed in key strategies and plans, requires building appropriate implementing capacity. The consideration to conduct a proper assessment on Fiji’s capacity and technology needs for climate actions, identifying gaps, and take steps to carry out capacity building and technology transfer for climate actions will be an important in bridging the gap between policy and implementation on the ground. 
There is also a need to strengthen the integration of climate actions into decision making at all levels of governance. Climate action cuts across many areas, which warrants the integration of climate change and disaster risk management into government decision making. One option is to develop a framework to assess the relevance of different government programmes to climate change and disaster management and integrate it into decision-making and also to be mindful of the decisions’ climate impacts. Additionally there is a need to improve inter-institutional coordination. Climate Change and Disaster Risk management coordination need to be strengthened across all relevant stakeholders which includes national and local government agencies, private sector stakeholders, development partners, NGOs, and local communities. 
Effectively improving institutional arrangements amongst relevant stakeholders will also improve the issue of predisposition of data with key planning and development agencies not having quality and reliable data readily available for informed decision making, disaster preparedness, and policy and strategy development. This further need to be aligned to a robust and transparent bottom-up monitoring, reporting and verification system that evaluates whether national and international support provided for climate action in the country is adequate, identifying where more efforts are concentrated as opposed to other areas and where efforts are still lacking, also identifying and learning how to direct resources where they are most needed.  
Another key element in implementing climate action is empowering local community for climate actions. While some communities have been supported in terms of capacity and resilience building, there is still a need for outreach to empower more communities and mobilize their participation for climate actions.
To summarize, Fiji continues to suffer significant economic losses from natural disasters because key sectors are still not well protected against climate adversities, noting the lack of implementing capacity of appropriate adaptation and mitigation measures and resilient infrastructure. Climate change presents new development complications which require drawing cross sectorial links and strengthening institutional arrangements with all key players. 
Model Town’s Resilience to Climate Change ImpactsModel Town Charitable Trust is a registered Charitable Trust in Fiji that provides cyclone proof housing in an engineered and fully serviced subdivision, and family advancement for severely poor families selected from the lowest income strata of society and mentally ill and disabled people. Koroipita Model Town consists of 241 houses providing shelter to over 1100 people. In parallel the Trust has built 738 homes in rural areas in the western division and housed a total of 4400 people. Evidently, there was zero damage to infrastructure and houses from T.C. Winston, which makes this town, a success story and an excellent climate resilient model.
The model also runs a community development programme covering education support, self-sufficiency in food production and income generating projects. Average family income increased from $200/month in 2016 to $533/month by 2018. There are 108 small enterprises of which 80% are run by women. Total of 368 kids graduated from kindergarten run by the model trust, 973 students graduated high school and 90 are now in to their tertiary education. There is a 100% school retention rate within Koroipita model town. 
The Model Towns concept provides a truly holistic solution for managing rural/urban drift, reducing squatter populations and resettling and assimilating climate change refugees. Koroipita scores highly on all the sustainable development goals, especially for   environment, empowerment of women and inclusive management. 
This model town was first established in 2007 and has been funded by the New Zealand Aid Programme, the Fiji Government (land acquisition) and from Rotary Clubs and the tourism sector, and individuals.
Fiji’s climate action exemplifies the seriousness of the issues of climate change and disaster risk faced by the most vulnerable Fijians, at the same time revealing the need for more urgent climate action from all nations of the world. Fiji’s efforts in the directions set out in key policy documents will be instrumental to guiding the process for climate proofing the nation and making all Fijians more resilient to the present and future unprecedented impacts of climate change however the key to curbing future climate impacts and its impact on our survival still lies in the hands of the rest of the world. 

SDG Goal 14 calls for the conservation and sustainably use of oceans, seas and marine resources. Oceans and seas regulate the world’s climate and underpin the water cycle. People close to the shores and especially Pacific Small Island Developments States, rely heavily on seafood for livelihoods. The Ocean is under threat with climate change exacerbating the already significant threats of over harvesting, habitat loss and pollution. With climate change, huge loses in this ecosystem has been stressing food availability. Marine pollution, an overwhelming majority of which comes much from land-based sources, is reaching alarming levels, with an average of 13,000 pieces of plastic litter to be found on every square kilometer of ocean. Coral Reefs, mangroves and other critical habitats are lost every year and our fisheries are being over exploited - both coastal and offshore. The Pacific tuna industry alone has a net value of over US$400 million. Fiji is committed to maintaining “sustainable island and ocean resources” as a priority area in its Green Growth Framework, and has proposed to develop the sector with “Sustainably managed fisheries resources” in its National Development Plan (NDP). The NDP and Green Growth Framework has explicitly set the target of achieving 30% Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), which exceeds the international commitment under Aichi Target 11 under the Convention on Biological Diversity.
Currently, Fiji does not have data on coastal eutrophication. Research on microplastics in marine species has been conducted by scientists at the University of the South Pacific. The study found plastic fibers from fishing net and fishing gears in fish guts. To address this issue, Fiji has a plastic bag levy to reduce plastic pollution and will implementing a complete ban on single-use plastic bags by 2020. Through the Fisheries Ministry and locally-based NGOs, Fiji is increasing its scope in ocean management to all of its EEZ. According to the Protected Planet Report 2018, Fiji currently has a total of 11,956 km2 of marine area being formally protected, increased from 10,952 km2 of marine area in 2014. However, this only accounts 0.93% of Fiji’s total marine area, well below the 10% Aichi Targets on the Convention on Biological Diversity or national commitments of 30% protection. 
In addition to formally-established MPAs, Fiji also has community managed areas within the iQoliqoli areas (traditional fisheries management areas). In 2013, the Fiji Locally Managed Marine Areas (FLMMA) network included 415 tabu (protected) areas within 143 iQoliqoli, covering about 965 km2 of marine areas. The Fiji LMMA Network commits to empowering communities to scale up their current  analysis of 2017 ocean conference voluntary commitments efforts to an effectively managed and governed network of LMMAs in all Fijian communities covering 100% of Fiji’s customary marine areas by 2025.The FLMMA are implemented by local communities, working together NGOs, government departments and academic institutions, to promote and encourage the preservation, protection and sustainable use of marine resources. In some cases, private sector players, such as local tourism operators working directly with local communities, have also engaged in protecting and conserving the marine resources by establishing MPAs through Marine Conservation Agreements (MCAs).
These efforts are complemented by the work of The Women in Fisheries Network – Fiji whose mission is to facilitate the role of women in sustainable fisheries, at all levels. Together with FLMMA, this mission ensures community engagement and decision-making in the fisheries sector is inclusive.
Fiji faces the danger of reduction in marine diversity; a number of marine species are endangered. According to a report from Fiji Parliament (2015), 8 out of 12 marine mammal species are endangered, 3 out of 10 marine reptile species are endangered, 49 out of 1198 marine fish specifies are endangered, and 2 out of 161 freshwater fish species are endangered. Fiji’s coral reefs are also under stress from increased sediment and other land-based sources of pollution, natural disasters such as cyclones, as well as elevated sea temperatures.
In order to safeguard customary areas in Fiji from commercial fishermen, the Fisheries Act, recognises the Fijian people’s customary right to fish in traditional fishing grounds (qoliqoli), and allows the owners of customary fishing rights to advise the District Commissioner and Fisheries Division which commercial fishermen shall be allowed to fish in their area and to impose restrictions on commercial fishermen. Licences to fish in customary fishing rights areas are only issued to fishermen who have already obtained a permit from the head of the relevant ownership unit. Over 500 fishing licenses have been issued for the year 2018 and this continues to grow in various parts of Fiji. Fish production remains stable for Fiji; however fishery industry’s contribution to Fiji’s GDP has been declining. Between 2000 and 2017, Fiji’s fish production remains stable at around 45 thousand metric ton annually. However, fishery sector’s contribution to GDP has been declining. In 2017, the fisheries industry accounted for 1.5% of GDP, declined from 3.2% in 2000. Fishery’s share in Fiji’s export has been declining as well. 
Gillett et al. (2018) has assessed 39 finfish groups in Fiji and has found that 10 of them are being or have been over exploited. Scientists from the Ministry of Fisheries, WWF and Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), assessed 16,404 fish from 180 species. Of the 29 most commonly caught and sold species, more than half of the species had stocks that were less that was needed to avoid long-term stock declines. Fourteen species were unlikely to have sufficient numbers to successful reproduce to maintain natural populations. Regulation and revision of minimum size limits and mesh sizes needs are urgently needed to restore these populations.
Some fish groups are even considered 

 Fishery production as % of GDP, 2000-2017 (RBF Quarterly Reviews)
to be locally extinct. With support from the WWF and the NZ AID, Tuna stocks are being managed under the Developing Sustainable and Responsible Tuna 
Longline Fisheries in Fiji which employee over 3,800 of the fisheries workforce. Fiji is also committed to the Fisheries Doha Development Agenda. With Fiji being a member of the World Trade Organisation since 1996, an equal and fair Fisheries tariffs and trade policies are being negotiated to ensure international compliance and at the same time a level playing field for the Pacific. This also prohibits certain Fisheries subsidies which eliminates some form of illegal, unidentified, and unreported (IUU) fishing. 
Currently, the total Official Development Assistance (ODA) for oceans from the year 2011-2018 is approximately FJ$7,036,504 which is only about 1% of the total ODA received by Fiji (Pacific Ocean Finance Programme, 2018). The Fisheries Ministry received about FJ$4,580,100 for marine training and research with capacity building in grant from Government Budget from Aug 2017 to July 2018 which is limited given the contribution of over US$1.7M from the marine ecosystem services (MACBIO, 2018).
Policy remains in place for various activities and the major legislations are the Fisheries Act 1942; Ports Authority of Fiji Act 1975; The Marine Spaces Act 1978; Marine Act 1986; Sea Ports Management Act 2005; Maritime Safety Authority Decree 2009; 
Coastal ProtectionOver the past decade, over 100 residents of Lamini Village on the island of Taveuni have often had their homes and village grounds inundated by strong tides and cyclone induced waves. When the first village seawall was built in Lamini in 1995, the effects of climate change were not as apparent as they are today. As a result, when the seawall was built, it was built only slightly above ground level. 23 years later, sea level rise and more ferocious cyclones have decimated the old Lamini village seawall. 
As the effects of climate change continue to threaten national development, livelihoods, natural resources, food security and health, there is an urgent need to build climate resilience, particularly in low-lying coastal communities who are the most vulnerable to rising sea levels and storm surges. Moreover, coastal erosion induced by climate change can wash away precious land, inundate cultural sites and burial grounds, and ruin arable farm land. Needless to say, climate change is an existential threat to the way of life we Fijians hold dear. 
The Lamini village seawall project is one of 25 costal protection projects earmarked in Fiji’s 2018-2019 financial year. These coastal works are expected to utilise environmentally friendly infrastructure solutions to prevent coastal erosion, prevent coastal inundation during storm surge events, protect existing village infrastructure, and enhance the overall safety of coastal communities. National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 20172024; Offshore Fisheries Management Decree 2012; International Seabed Mineral Management Decree 2013; and the latest Tuna Management Plan (2010). Various other policies and documents are in development phase and include; the National Fisheries Policy (draft), Fiji Aquaculture Strategy (draft), Fiji Inshore Compliance Strategy (draft) Inshore Fisheries Policy & Framework (draft), the Inshore Fisheries Data Sharing Policy (draft) and the Ocean Policy. 
Fiji has registered a total of 17 voluntary commitments towards the Protection and Sustainable Management of the Ocean with the United Nations. 
Gaps and Challenges 
SDG 14 indicators for Fiji do not have clear methodologies developed yet hence there is a lack in baseline data to start with. The System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) methodologies are being piloted with the UNESCAP and the Fiji Bureau of Statistics and will help overcome this issue but with little progress into the 2030 agenda, there is an urgent need for identifying and overcoming the skills and tools gap for Fiji. While Fiji is leading the Ocean Pathway Partnership with Sweden, there are very recent discussions around NDCs and a whole set of reason why ocean finance, governance and regulations are still in early development phases.
The Pacific Community (SPC), has also installed Realtime wave buoy data supported mooring, including 15 temperature sensors and 3 pressure sensors, coastal baseline data (Bathy-Topo) for Coral Coast (60 km of coastline) as well as the New Fiji Global Navigation 

Satellite System (GNSS) Continuously Operating Reference Station (CORS) installed for precision positioning. However, there is need for world class research facilities in order to monitor data over a period of time and many monitoring toolkits are not available in Fiji to carry out such measurements including ocean acidification. The Fiji Ministry of Fisheries is also putting in place a program to deploy more coastal and offshore fish aggregating devices (FADs) to encourage people to move seaward outside of the reef systems; fishing around FADS which will relieve fishing pressure within the reef system, and ensure that damaged coral colonies or depleted reef systems recover. Fiji is set to develop an Ocean Policy that integrates the UN Law of the Sea including MPAs, other effective area-based management measures, and coastal conservation. Finance for ocean activities has been increasing through the Global Environment Facility, Green Climate Fund, and other bilateral and multilateral funding.
Way Forward
The SDGs aim to sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems from pollution, as well as address the impacts of ocean acidification. Enhancing conservation and the sustainable use of ocean-based resources through international law will also help mitigate some of the challenges facing our oceans. It is important that all stakeholders continue to work together in preserving our precious ocean, seas and marine resources.  For the tourism sector in the Pacific, it is vital that Government and private sector are equally committed to ensuring Environmental Impact Assessments are carried out before major tourism developments take place.  Existing tourism businesses also must ensure compliance to minimum standards, which eventually contribute to the longer term preservation of natural resources, the sector depends on.  Economic benefits from the ocean, seas and marine resources would only be sustainable if current and future development is sustainable. Fiji’s ocean is part of the wider western and central Pacific Ocean. More collaboration with the countries within the region is required so as to tackle the challenges of IUU fishing, over-fishing on the high seas, etc. JICA has invested in local training in this regard for the Ministry of Fisheries and is expanding technical expertise for the Fisheries sector. More regional collaboration can also raise Fiji’s voice in regional marine decision making, facilitate the sharing of common facilities, both physical and informational, and may encourage Fiji businesses to develop services with a wider market. Some of this can be addressed by the current Pacific-European Union Marine Partnership for Fiji.
Current Status and Trends
In 2015, the total estimated hectares of forest were 1.1 million, covering 55.7% of Fiji’s total land area. This represents a 3.5 percentage point increase since 1990.  The total hectares of forest include 526,453 ha of native forest, 76,171ha of pine forest and 54,000 ha of mahogany forest. The Global Forest Assessment Report (FRA) 2015 reported a decrease in the area of closed forests by 7,500 ha, while an increase in the area of open forests by 13,790 ha, each year based on the recorded trends between 1991 and 2010. The report forecasted that by 2015 the area of closed forests would stand at 524,476 ha with the open forest area increasing to 483,634 ha. 
There has been a loss of certain forest types, some of which were once extensive in Fiji. Fiji’s remaining native forest is now mainly confined to areas of high rainfall, high elevation and steep slopes, with much of the accessible lowland forest cleared by loggers or converted to plantations or agriculture. The exploitation of forests for timber has played a major role in deforestation and significantly affected forest quality and diversity. 
According to the Protected Planet Report 2018, Fiji currently has 146 protected areas (both territorial and Marine) that has increased by 4 since 2014. Protected territorial areas cover 1037 km2 of territorial areas, accounting for 5.7% of Fiji’s land area. The total terrestrial land protected has increased by 549 km2 since 2007 and 189 km2 since 201427. The national goal under Fiji’s 2017- 2024 National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan is to achieved 17 % of total protected terrestrial land. 
27 See National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan for Fiji 2017-2024
Terrestrial land is home to diverse species of plants and animals. Much of Fiji’s biodiversity is unique to Fiji. There are 1,769 recorded native vascular plant species in Fiji of which 50% are endemic. Current best estimates suggest that Fijian flora consists of 310 pteridophytes and at least 2,225 seed plants. Over 90% of some insect groups, such as cicadas and marine insects, are all endemic. Out of a total of 27 reptile species, 12 are endemic.
According to the Red List Index, Fiji has experienced loss of diversity with Fiji’s Red List Index declined from 0.71 in 1993 to 0.67 in 2016. Fiji’s loss of biodiversity is also more serious than the global average, which has the Red List Index at 0.74 in 2016, and the Pacific average, which has the Red List Index at 0.79 in 2016. The baseline assessment on SDGs in Fiji revealed that of the 2543 known plants species in Fiji, 281 plant species are endangered; of the 68 bird species, 17 are endangered; of the 1198 known marine fish species in Fiji, 49 species are endangered; and both species of Amphibians in Fiji are endangered.
Gaps and Challenges
In the absence of a national land use plan, major constraints are placed on resource allocation and management in the rural sector. It is of critical importance to ensure rationalised infrastructure development that considers the impacts on all landbased resources such as forest agriculture, minerals, rivers and streams. The government continues to seek a balance between economic development and environment integrity through Environment Impact Assessments, establishment of protected areas and project feasibility studies. Fiji’s 5-year and 20-Year National Development plan emphasises that natural systems are critical for food and nutrition security, sustaining endemic flora and fauna, and maintaining the natural balance in nature. 
Further to development led stress on the natural environment, is the human attitude and behaviour towards the natural environment. Discussions arising during stakeholder consultations stressed that the human behaviour is a crucial element to the preservation of life on earth. Education and awareness play key roles in instating behavioural changes in the society however it has been observed that posing legal measures are more successful in creating responsible citizens. The Government’s decision to implement the Plastic Levy and the ban of single use plastic by 2020 are commendable steps towards biodiversity preservation. 
Way Forward 
Fiji is participating World Banks emissions reduction programme. The Emissions Reduction Programme Document (ERPD) is one of Fiji’s major projects in progress under the REDD+ programme to protect and enhance Fiji’s forests and determine the value of carbon credits. The overall approach and design of the ERPD to address the drivers and underlying causes of forest loss and barriers to sustainable forest management, forest conservation and enhancement to build on and support implementation of the current ambitious national and sub national priorities. The ERP gives opportunities to agroforestry activities to sustain livelihoods. ERP thus builds onto the implementation of the long term decarbonisation strategy outlined in the Fiji Low Emission Development Strategy (LEDS). The 4 million trees in 4 years initiative of Fiji builds on to the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development particularly SDG 15 and supports the New York Declaration on Forests which aims to end natural forest loss by 2030. The initiative further supplements the ERP in its efforts to carry out afforestation and the Queen’s Commonwealth Canopy. The
Fiji has been receiving financial support from various sources including the GEF Small Grants Programme, PoWPA, the European Union (water management and biofuel projects) and International Labour Organization (training and funding for projects that are environmental friendly, e.g. Molituva project inclusive of piggery, catering and sites attractions for tourists). The country also received active support in the implementation of the national NBSAP from several NGOs, such as the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) to name a few. To compliment bilateral and multilateral aid, the Fijian government has shown commitment by using domestic financing vessels such as the ECAL and the Green Bonds to fund the REDD+ pilot projects. The 2014 Green Growth Framework and 20-year National Development Plan for Fiji further highlights the necessity of determining of the value of carbon credits from forests, through relevant data, surveys and information. The finalisation of the Market Mechanisms under the Paris Agreement, will allow countries with high forest cover such as Fiji to engage and forest carbon trading. Incorporating the AFOLU sector into the NDCs under the Paris Agreement will also reiterate on the much needed resources to address sustainable and managed forests.
 


4 Million Trees in Four Years
The four million trees initiative includes plans to plant all types of trees from timber to fruit and ornamental trees. The “Plant 4 Million Trees in Four Years” initiative was launched in Silana Village in Dawasamu in February 2019. It is also part of the Fijian Government’s commitment to grow the Fijian economy through the forestry sector in partnership with the Fiji Development Bank and the iTaukei Affairs Board. It is indeed through such partnership that the future generations of Silana will live in a healthy and environmentally safe Fiji. The 4 million trees initiative not only reflects visionary leadership but it also reflects a deep sense of responsibility that we could leave our beloved nation in a better state then when we found it. Most importantly this initiative would mean that the Forestry sector could significantly increase its contributions to our economic growth.Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels

Current Status and Trends 
Fiji’s system of governance is based on the principle that all Fijians are equal under the law. Preserving this system warrants a strong commitment to upholding the rule of law, national security and maintaining and strengthening public institutions that are effective, fair, inclusive and accountable to the people. Thus, the rule of law is considered to be both an enabler of the SDGs and an outcome of development in its own right. Fiji is committed to promoting peaceful and inclusive society for sustainable development demonstrated through expanding legal services to improve access to justice for all Fijians, provision of resources for legal aid services, court sittings in rural and outer islands, greater decentralisation of services and improvement in infrastructure and design of prison facilities that is conducive to rehabilitation and security. 
Reducing Violence 
Fiji has put much emphasis to deal with issues relating to violence and related death rates weather its violence against women or children or homicide cases. Working with relevant stakeholders, Fiji has kept the intentional homicides relatively low. Fiji has incorporated significant elements of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) into its laws and policies and is implementing the National Gender Policy and the Women’s Plan of Action. Domestic violence legislation has been developed and utilised by the Fiji Police Force (FPF) and courts as an overarching approach to reduce violence experienced by women and children.
Complementary to this is the establishment of a 24hour toll free helpline, administered by the Fiji Women’s Crisis Centre to provide counselling and appropriate referral for survivors of domestic violence as well as to avenues for redress. These and other measures backed by vibrant Fijian NGOs, are leading the way in the region in best practice in service. 
Ending Abuse and Exploitation of Children 
In Fiji, a child’s right to live free from violence and to be protected from all forms of violence, abuse and exploitation is enshrined in the Constitution. In addition to “the right to security of the person”, which applies to every Fijian, children’s rights are further defined as “to be protected from abuse, neglect, harmful cultural practices, any form of violence, inhumane treatment and punishment, and hazardous or exploitative labour”. 
Fiji has ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Child (UNCRC), Optional Protocol to Convention on Rights of Child (child trafficking, prostitution, pornography), Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punishment of Child and the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime. The FPF has established a cell within its Internal Affairs Directorate to attend to these Conventions using established national or agency frameworks and platforms. 
As the agenda is cross-sectoral, the FPF draws assistance and collaborates with various Government agencies, UN agencies, a large number of civil society organisations, community and children/women support groups, faith-based organizations, municipal councils and the Fiji Human Rights and Anti-Discrimination Commission for action, awareness, advocacy, enforcement, investigation and training of its own staff as well as those in the community, i.e. child victims/ witnesses, parents, guardians and counsellors.
At national level, children’s right to care and protection has been addressed under a variety of national laws. For example child abuse and exploitation has been dealt with in the Crimes Act 2009, Domestic Violence Act 2009, Juveniles Act 1974 (on child pornography) while child victims and witnesses in criminal proceedings has been dealt with through Juveniles Act 1974, Criminal Procedure Act 2009, Standard Operating Procedures for Handling Children in Contact with the Law, Child Protection Guidelines for Public Prosecutors and violence in school has been dealt with Policy on Child Protection in Schools 2015 and  Guidelines Banning Corporal Punishment. 
At the core of a Fiji’s child protection system are the services that children and families receive to reduce vulnerability to violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation. 
The child protection system comprises of the Department of Social Welfare (DSW) under the Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation (MWCPA), FPF, Judiciary and Government agencies dealing with children. DSW is the lead agency responsible for child and family welfare services in Fiji. It also supports and coordinates a range of awareness-raising and social mobilization activities aimed at strengthening family responsibilities, improving parenting practices and reducing children’s vulnerability to violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation. As child protection cuts cross the activities of many agencies, Fiji has established a National Coordinating Committee on Children (NCCC), which is mandated to monitor and coordinate the implementation of child-related laws, policies and programmes.
The FPF’s Juvenile Bureau under the Sexual Offences Section investigates child trafficking and exploitation including child labour cases in Fiji, as well as across our borders. The FPF provides information/intelligence of any kind to the regional and international counterparts. The assistance from INTERPOL and the FPF’s Cyber Crime Unit is specifically assigned to use sophisticated software and online applications for surveillance and investigation of child related cases, either probable, and/or on-going.
The FPF has strengthened its statistics section, with more scope and expertise to capture, analyse child and other related data for trend analysis, decision-making support, dissemination and sharing with executives, and stakeholders in the quest to safeguard interests of the child. Working with the Judiciary, the FPF safeguards the interests of a child victim by ensuring that the evidence and testimonies by law are adduced in the private space of child in courtrooms. Even video conferencing, and video recorded interviews of the child victim is adduced as testimonies. Further, Fiji has established one dedicated Juvenile Court in Suva and the Magistrates Courts in other areas are declared Juvenile Courts when hearing children’s matters. 
Fiji’s ratification of the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (UNCAT) in 2016 and the journey to its implementation was an opportunity for Fiji to review existing procedures and overcome ineffective practices in law enforcement and detention sectors, in line with SDG 16. 
Since ratification, Fiji embarked on a First Hour Procedure Project aimed at improving the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the law enforcement and detention sectors in delivering access to justice in a manner that is transparent with a substantially reduced risk of torture and ill-treatment through imposed accountability and an improved remedial recourse against violations of detained persons’ rights in the initial period. 
To end torture as an investigative tool, and to guarantee everyone the right to a fair trial, ensuring access to competent lawyers as early in the legal process as possible is critical. The First Hour Procedure Project ensures the provision of counsel to every suspect at the police station, within one hour of arrest, with a protocol guiding the conduct of both police and lawyers in relation to the implementation of this right. Besides providing access to counsel, under the First Hour Procedure project, Police Stations are also recording interviews of persons in custody. These new procedures and the various reforms undertaken by the police force have not only reduced coercive forms of interrogation, they have also led to real efficiencies and attitudinal changes in the police force.’
Equal Access to Justice 
Ordinary people who cannot afford to pay for legal services are often left behind or become lost in the justice system without protection or access to a lawyer, making them vulnerable to systematic pre-trial detention, mistreatment, or forced confessions. Fiji makes its commitment to justice through its Constitution. The access to justice has made more accessible in recent years through increasing the number of Judges and Magistrates, and having more court sittings in rural areas and outer islands in the maritime zone and building capacity through the upgrading and construction of court facilities, improving access to services through the Internet, training programmes for judicial officers and adoption of case management practices to improve efficiency.
Another mechanism to ensure the access to justice by all Fijians is through the Legal Aid Commission (LAC), which is established to provide legal services to members of the public who cannot afford the services of a private legal practitioner. The Fijian Constitution gives the Legal Aid Commission constitutional recognition, guarantees its operational independence, and ensures adequate funding by the Government. 
The LAC is guided by Fiji’s commitments to international standards and guidelines, principal amongst these, are the UN Principles and Guidelines on Legal Aid in the Criminal Justice Systems and the UN Sustainable Development Goals. In the area of Criminal Law, the LAC provides legal  advice,  assistance  and  representation  for persons  detained, arrested  or  imprisoned,  suspected or  accused  of,  or  charged  with  a  criminal  offence and  for  victims  and  witnesses  in  the  criminal  justice process, ensuring that all aspects of the criminal justice system are compliant with the Constitution of Fiji and international standards. The LAC is the largest law firm in Fiji and has 17 branches spread across the country including branches in outer islands. The Commission is therefore taking active steps to take its services to the doorsteps of the communities. The LAC’s scheme and various services not only include litigation work and advice but engagements in partnership projects and robust awareness programmes in order to enhance greater access to justice for all Fijians.  
The Rights, Empowerment and Cohesion (REACH) for Rural and Urban Fijians Project—a partnership of government agencies and international organizations through cost, information and resource sharing— conducts awareness raising of the social, economic and legal rights enshrined in the Constitution. A mobile service delivery approach is undertaken to reach communities throughout Fiji with the focus to reach the furthest behind first. In 2018, the project set out a target of reaching 4,000 Fijians but managed to reach 8,787 Fijians who could access essential government services.
The achievement and success of the Legal Aid scheme in providing greater access to justice can be measured by the continuous numbers of new applications every year to the Commission. For example, the total number of new applications received by LAC in 2017 was 16,418 and in 2018 it totalled 20,504. This represents a 20 percent increase in new applications from the previous year.
The Fiji Access to Justice Project which is funded by the European Union and implemented by the UNDP Fiji office is another example where donor agencies acknowledge the importance of the LAC to be able to reach out to the most vulnerable groups and empower them through ensuring easier or rather equal access to justice. The project supports access to justice for impoverished and vulnerable groups through empowering people to access legal rights and services through the relevant key justice institutions, in conjunction with strengthening those key justice institutions to undertake improved service delivery. Some of the initiatives under the project include piloting online case management and e-filing systems.  
Reducing Illicit Financial Flows
Fiji ratified the United Nation Convention against Transnational Organized Crime in 2017 and has since been implementing certain elements of the Convention prior to the accession through legislations, such as the Proceeds of Crime Act, Crimes Act 2009, Fiji Independent Commission against Corruption Act, Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Act, Extradition Act and Financial Transactions Reporting Act (FTRA). The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), (FPF), Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), and the Fiji Revenue and Customs Services (FRCS) are the agencies responsible for monitoring and detecting, investigating and prosecuting of illicit financial flows, money laundering and financing for terrorism cases within Fiji. The national coordination on anti-money laundering issues is handled through the National Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Council, comprising of the Reserve Bank of Fiji, FIU, Ministry of Justice, ODPP, FRCS and the FPF. The National AML Council has conducted a Fiji Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism National Risk Assessment between 2014 and 2015. This assessment has estimated the scale of different illicit financial activities and identified the risk for money laundering and terrorist financing in Fiji. This assessment enables Fiji to apply a risk-based approach (RBA) to ensure that measures to prevent or mitigate money laundering and terrorist financing are commensurate with the risks identified.
FIU leads the anti-money laundering framework in Fiji and is responsible for implementing the FTRA, monitoring and detecting money laundering activities, and disseminating information on suspicious financial activities to relevant law enforcement agencies. A key function of the FIU is to analyse reports of financial transactions that it receives from financial institutions and other agencies in Fiji. FRCS is responsible for identifying of tax evasion, customs fraud, and illicit cross border trading activities. A number of initiatives have been implemented to improve the efficiency of FRCS and to improve tax and custom compliance, including the gradual adoption of Customs Modernisation Approach in customs process, promoting online registration, electronic transaction systems, and online payments through a new National Tax Information System (NTIS), information sharing between FRCS and FIU, the development of annual Compliance Improvement Strategies and the Risk Management Framework including the launch of intelligence database. The FIU is also reviewing the Cash Transaction Reporting framework to possibly widen the type and threshold value of transactions that will allow it to more comprehensively monitor illicit financial flows, including tax evasion activities.
Reducing Corruption 
In its efforts to substantially reduce corruption and bribery in all their forms, the Fijian Government established the Fiji Independent Commission Against Corruption (FICAC) as an independent legal institution mandated under Chapter 5, Section 113 of the Constitution to investigate, institute and conduct criminal proceeding against corruption and is guided by the standards established under the United Nations Convention against Corruption. Between 2007 and 2017, a total of 366 persons have been convicted of corruption related crimes and more than 67,000 complaints have been made to the FICAC, which has started to collaborate with NGOs in fighting corruption in Fiji. 
Aiming to instil anticorruption values in the education system, Fiji has developed and implemented the National Anti-Corruption Curriculum for secondary school students in four subject areas including Accounting, English, Mathematics and Social Sciences. For the primary school students a Good Kiddo programme has been initiated that educates young children on anticorruption practices. Participants are explained the functions of FICAC, how to identify corruption and its effects and are also taught the Good Kiddo values of trust, honesty, obedience and respect. 
Accountable and Inclusive Institutions 
The Fijian Constitution lays down the fundamental principles and the framework for the separation of powers between the three arms of the State – the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary allowing for checks and balances. 
Participation in Institutions of Global Governance 
In 2018, Fiji was elected to the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC), an inter-governmental body within the United Nations system made up of 47 States responsible for the promotion and protection of all human rights around the globe. Fiji vied for a seat in the Asia Pacific category alongside Philippines, India, Bahrain and Bangladesh and received 187 votes indicating a strong statement of confidence in Fiji. The membership of the UNHRC is for a period of three years beginning 1 January 2019. Fiji has also been appointed as one of four Vice Presidents of the Human Rights Council and is a member of the UNHCR Bureau. As such, Fiji is required to chair various meetings of the UNCHR, including Council sessions and Universal Periodic Review sessions.   
Providing Legal Identity for All 
Civil registration systems are government-administrated systems used to record vital events including live births, deaths, foetal deaths, marriages and divorces. These permanent records have two main uses. First, they are personal legal documents that confer individual rights of identity, property and status. Second, and most importantly from a demographic and epidemiological perspective, they provide data that have the potential to serve as the main source of national vital statistics.
In the quest to provide a legal identity for all Fijians, Birth, Death and Marriage (BDM) registration services have been decentralised and are now offered in many locations across the four Divisions of the country. Recognising the importance of birth registration, the Fijian Government announced an amnesty for people that have not registered their births with the waiver of the standard fee for late registration. Consequently, adults that never had a birth certificate got themselves registered for the first time. Families have also been encouraged to come forward to report the deaths of any family members for whom death certificates had never been issued.
In 2019, the Fijian Government under the digitalFIJI initiative launched a birth registration application that allows citizens to initiate the birth registration process electronically from the hospital or at home as opposed to going to a BDM office. Once the birth is registered, an appointment can be made with the BDM office for collection without having to wait in long queues for BDM services. 
Access to Information and Transparent Government
The transparency of Government agencies is demonstrated through disclosure and publication of annual plans, annual reports and audit reports. Inclusive and transparent policy dialogue such as the one carried out in the preparation of the 5-Year & 20Year NDP and the annual budget consultations are a permanent feature of Government administration. The Fijian Government is also implementing a digitalFIJI programme, aiming to make more Government services available online and through mobile applications. The Information Act 2018 also gives effects to the rights of a person to access to information held by a public agency. The work of the Parliament is central to the transparency and accountability of the Fijian Government. Parliamentary sessions are broadcasted live, and Hansard reports are available on the Fijian Parliament website for anyone to read. The existence of the Public Service Commission and the Auditor-General add to the capacity of the Fijian Parliament and Fijian people to hold the Government accountable. 
Gaps and Challenges
While Fiji has made many advances in promoting peace, justice and strong institutions, there remain gaps and challenges that hinder the relevant agencies to meet the KPIs under the SDG indicators. 
Lack of awareness or knowledge on the applicable laws and legislations are becoming major excuse for non-compliance. Lack of capacity of national courts to hear matters on a timely basis is resulting into prolonged court dates and delayed justice. This is in fact discouraging citizens from taking matters to courts. Also, the social stigma associated with sexual crimes discourages victims of sexual offences to report matters. Traditional means of settlement and reconciliation hinders the justice system.
Geographical isolation of communities and isolation in domestic household (family) or secret/close environment is also a major challenge in providing the best available services. The primitive mentality makes it challenging to implement modern laws and services whereby some people reject to adapt to the transforming economy. 
Increase in digital services also warrants the need for an upgraded cyber security. While services are becoming more available, more training and professional development are needed for relevant staff to make use of the available services. 
Inter-agency and cross-national collaboration and coordination has also become a challenge due to CSO’s and other international agencies working in isolation, such as for project work, research or short-term focus.
Way Forward
To ensure that we effectively meet SDG 16 targets, improvements can be made in many areas to bridge the identified gaps. Firstly, data is essential in order to address the challenges therefore a robust national analysis on access to justice and on inclusiveness of societies for sustainable development is critical. More support services need to be developed for victims of sexual offences in order to encourage them to report the crimes committed.
Government will continue its efforts to further improve access to justice. Correctional services and rehabilitation of inmates for re-integration of inmates into society will continue. This will help maintain the current low recidivism rate by providing inmates with opportunities to learn skills for income generation and through other personal support. Allocation of more resources to the legal aid commission and also to the judiciary will boost legal aid services and assist in more court sittings in rural and outer islands to clear the back log of cases.
The FPF will be strengthened to ensure security and effective crime prevention. Resources will be channelled towards recruitment and training, provision of vehicles and equipment, and decentralisation of services for quick and effective response. Programmes will be established to promote community engagement and public awareness on laws and modern services. Border security will be maintained and further enhanced through improved coordination and ensuring availability of adequate resources. Fiji will develop and ensure effective implementation of its National Security Strategy and support for UN Peacekeeping operations.


Providing greater access to justice for all Fijians
“Access to justice is a basic principle of the rule of law which enables Fijians access to the formal justice system and allows them the opportunity to be heard. In supporting the Fijian Government’s commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals, in particular, Goal 16 by promoting just, peaceful and inclusive societies, the Legal Aid Commission has implemented policies and activities aimed at achieving this Goal.
The Legal Aid Commission is a statutory body established by the Legal Aid Act of 1996. It has been given constitutional recognition under the Fijian Constitution which guarantees is independence, autonomy, and adequate funding by Parliament. The Commission provides a range of legal services in the area of Civil, Criminal, and Family Law matters. All its services are free for those who cannot afford the services of a private legal practitioner.
In its pursuit to “providing greater access to justice for all Fijians” and in strengthening access to justice, the Commission also undertakes community education awareness programs by reaching out to those in the rural, remote, and maritime areas of Fiji. Through such programs and roadshows, we are taking our services to the doorsteps of the community which is aimed at empowering all Fijians, especially the vulnerable members of society, such as women, children, and those with special needs.
 In accordance with the United Nations Principles and Guidelines on Legal Aid in Criminal Justice Systems, the services provided by the Legal Aid Commission ensures a fair and equitable justice system which allows equal access to justice for all Fijians.”Partnerships for the Goals – Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development

Current Status and Trends
The SDGs can only be realised with strong global partnerships and cooperation. Fiji recognises the importance of our international, regional, domestic and non-state stakeholder partners as crucial conduits in our continued development trajectory in accordance with the 5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan. There is a need to continue to forge partnerships to enhance better informed decision making in respect to the SDGs. Fiji intends to maintain collective progress on SDG 17 through prudent reforms and strategic relations with bilateral and multilateral partners. There is a need to better map out domestic and international partners critical for substantial financial support, technology and knowledge management and capacity building to achieve the SDG targets. Fiji alone will be unable to deliver on all national development aspirations thus we look towards nurturing existing international relations and forging new ones with domestic and international partners alike to create development momentum, address emerging risks and maintain economy wide sustainability.
Finance and Economic Growth 
Fiji’s revenue as percent of current GDP stands at 28.6% in 2017-2018 compared to 27.2% in 2013 indicating that revenue collections have grown with GDP. Domestic taxes make up 87.3% of Fiji’s revenue in 2017-2018 which has declined from 89.6% in 2013. This is largely due to increase in share of non-tax revenue from government services and dividend returns from state owned enterprises as a diversified revenue portfolio will help improve fiscal stability. Further to progressive fiscal measures, the Fiji Revenue and Customs Services (‘FRCS’) is being provided with increased resources and legal mandate to enhance tax collections. The

Tax Authority has been simplifying its tax service and has implemented an income tax system that removes the burden of tax paper work from employees and has gradually modernised its tax and custom services. 
Through strategic institutional reforms, prudent public financial management and improved revenue collections, Fiji has managed to dramatically reduce its Operational Expenditure to Capital Expenditure ratio. This reform has enabled Fiji to leverage financial support from development partners for numerous socio-economic programmes. Fiji is currently working closely with selected development partners on Public Financial Management Reform programmes to develop a more robust financial reporting systems to that will ultimately enhance accountability and transparency and strengthen investor confidence. Fiji is also exploring options to integrate tracking systems into the reform process to better track its development progress and fund utilisation. Fiji is leading the Pacific to develop affordable, scalable and transparent climate finance solutions for vulnerable segments of society. However, such research and innovation need technical and financial assistance/engagement from external financiers, particularly the private sector (investors, insurance and reinsurance companies).
Noting that Fiji is not an aid dependent country, we are nonetheless ever grateful for the continued support from the various bilateral partners with their assistance in critical areas of national interest such as education, agriculture, climate resilience projects, private sector development, disaster management, capacity building and empowering women. Development assistance has also primarily financed the work and programmes of many civil society groups in Fiji which has effectively enhanced public policy discourse and has better influence development partner projects in Fiji and the region. Classic example of such partnership is the Australian Humanitarian Partnership which facilitates partnerships between the Fijian and Australian Humanitarian Non-Government Organisations to actively support disaster risk resilience. Such partnership has allowed improved co-orindation at an international level.
Technology for Enhancing Economic Growth
As Fiji transforms itself into a modern nation and reaffirms its status as the hub of the Pacific, increased emphasis is being placed on bridging the technological divide between rural areas and urban centres, introducing state of the art technology in the public and the private sector to improve productivity and using technology to implement development targets in a bigger, better and faster way. Fiji is considered one of the most connected nation in the South Pacific. 
Currently, there are efforts to improve the access to ICT services, and to develop ICT based services, which to boost economic development, create ICT jobs, improve access to education and contribute to national security.
To further improve ICT penetration on Fiji’s second largest island Vanua Levu, the Fijian Government is working with the World Bank to extend the Southern Cross Cable that will run from Fiji to Samoa (a great example of south-south partnerships) to the southern tip of Vanua Levu. De-monopolising the ICT sector to introduce productive competition allowed greater private sector investments in communication infrastructure and introduced tailor-made IT services that never had been provisioned for before. Moreover, through partnership with the Singapore Cooperation Enterprise, Fiji is implementing various ITC applications to create a more connected and smarter country. This drive for digital transformation has seen the launch of the Digital Fiji Programme. Other technological advancement in Fiji include the introduction of the digital television (Walesi), E-ticketing on busses creating a seamless public transportation system and tax incentives and state funded start-up capital for ICT business. While investments in technology is being rigorously perused by Fiji, we are cognisant of the need for robust policies that prevent cybercrime and Fiji is working on improving cyber security by fostering international cooperation through the Asia Pacific Computer Emergency Readiness Teams (CERT).
Trade and the International Spectrum 
International trade plays a crucial role in promoting growth in a developing economy like Fiji. Fiji continues to negotiate for fair and equitable trade agreements that take into account our unique challenges and constraints, as well as our comparative advantages in key strategic sectors. This strategy is necessary to protect the nation’s interests and ensure Fiji continues on a path of sustainable growth and development in the future. The Fijian Trade Policy Framework (2015-2025) lays out a comprehensive course of action to boost the trade performance.  Further, to better facilitate trade and simplify the flow of goods and services with its trading partners, Fiji has entered into a number of trade agreements to reduce trade barriers. Some examples of these treaties are the Melanesian Spearhead Group Trade Agreement (MSG), Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement (PICTA), Interim Economic Partnership Agreement (IEPA), The South Pacific Regional Trade and Economic Cooperation Agreement (SPARTECA) and Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations (PACER). Fiji uses these agreements to gain a competitive edge over global market players and to better establish the country’s trading facilities. 
Modernising the Fijian Health SystemIn January 2019, the Fijian Government formalised the Public Private Partnership arrangement in its quest to increase private sector participation in improving the efficiency of health services in Fiji. The Aspen Medical was the successful Selected Bidder for the provision of health services under this new arrangement. They will partner with Fiji National Provident Fund with the aim to support Fiji’s strategic objective to modernise the Fijian health system, particularly in the areas of primary and tertiary healthcare. The arrangement will involve developing, financing, upgrading, operating and maintaining the Lautoka Hospital, Fiji’s second largest hospital, and the new Ba Sub-divisional hospital, as well as offering more specialised health services to the population.
The public private partnership is aimed at utilizing private sector expertise and efficiencies in providing specialised clinical services and recruiting and retaining health staff. This will also seek to increase the access of specialist services available within the country and counter the increasing expenditure being incurred on overseas patient referrals. National Health capability development and capacity building will be the foundation of this partnership. Monitoring and evaluation frameworks will be in place to ensure utilization of services are accessible at minimal costs. The contracts’ duration is 23 years, during which it will deliver enhanced clinical services across a range of specialties including Renal Dialysis; Chemotherapy; Maternity; Oncology; Coronary Care, Intensive Care, as well as the usual mainstream services such as Emergency Department; Maternity Services; Neonatal and Children’s Services; and Operating Theatres.    
Capacity Building and Systematic Issues
The 5 Year and 20 Year National Development Plan (NDP) has aligned the strategic priorities for all Ministries towards the attainment of the SDGs however there remains room to place more emphasis in facilitating the implementation of the goals at an agency level. It is noted that there is room to further strengthen capacity building to better include the various stakeholders, such as Civil Society Organisations and Private Sector partners, in planning and implementing the SDGs. The inclusion of the Private Sector must be significantly heightened. Increased awareness and encouragement for the Private Sector to better incorporate the SDGs in their priority list of Social Responsibilities will further assist implementation. Comprehensive collection of national statistical data is vital for tracking progress of the SDGs. There is room for strengthening Capacity Building in the area of Monitoring and Evaluation and an innovative approach through partnership and programmes to be formulated that could better include the core stakeholders in this activity. There must be collective efforts by all in realising the SDGs. 
Gaps and Challenges
The availability of quality, accessible, open, timely and disaggregated data is vital to plan, implement and track progress toward the SDGs and indicators that are key in driving economic growth for the country. There is an urgent need to improve data gathering, standardisation and dissemination in relation to Fiji SDG’s indicators. While there is initiative to creating policy coherence and building institutional capacity to deliver on the SDGs, it is crucial that subnational governments and communities take ownership and understand the fundamental role they play in the successful implementation of the SDGs. 
Way Forward
Global Partnership: Fiji-Australia Aid Programme 
Global partnership for Fiji is indeed reflected in the many bilateral relations which our country has nurtured and expanded, one of which is our ties with Australia. Fiji and Australia share an enduring relationship, underpinned by strong people-to-people links and long-standing trade and investment ties. 
Australia is the largest bilateral partner to Fiji. Australia’s aid to Fiji focuses on supporting inclusive economic growth to reduce poverty through targeted investments in private sector development and human development. Working in partnership with the Fijian Government, Australia’s assistance provides support to Fiji’s most vulnerable communities, including persons with disabilities. Australia’s major investments in education, effective governance, private sector development, health and gender equality contribute towards achieving objectives in Fiji’s National Development Plan and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 
Australia’s aid objectives include: 
• supporting increased private sector development; 
• improving human development; and      
• building Fiji’s climate and disaster preparedness and response. 
In the aftermath of Tropical Cyclone Winston in 2016, Australia was one of the first respondents to provide assistance to Fiji. Support included repair and rebuilding of health and education facilities that suffered significant damage in the Ra and Koro regions, and the rebuilding of the Rakiraki municipal market to improve livelihood opportunities for those affected by TC Winston, particularly women.Fiji is yet to reach its full potential due to fundamental issues of limited fiscal resources. We look towards our development partners to drive progress in fundamental areas of national development and progress. Existing partnerships need to be significantly strengthened and new ones need to be actively pursued to ensure that Fiji accelerates towards its SDG targets. Fiji is mindful that national development ambitions will require substantial mobilisation of finance far beyond its current fiscal capacity. However, in true Fijian spirit of dedication and perseverance, we plan to mobilise domestic finance towards SDGs and climate change through targeted fiscal spending and utilising innovative financial solutions.



Finance for SDGs
To achieve SDG ambitions through the 5-Year and 20Year NDP, Fiji requires significant mobilisation of both public and private sector finance. It is estimated that over FJ$20 billion is required from Fiji’s public and private sector during the period between 2016 and 2021 to implement the 5-Year NDP. To implement its 20-Year NDP it is estimated that around FJ$50 billion is required from the Fijian Government alone that suggests the need to explore new and innovative development financing.
The current and future financial resources available to meet Fiji’s financial demand for its development and achieving its SDG goals originate broadly from four sources:
a) Domestic - private: domestic gross savings, as well as the increased credit from domestic financial market due to the deepening of the financial market;  
b) Domestic - public: tax revenues and other public revenues;
c) International - private: remittance, foreign direct investment (FDI) and portfolio investment, philanthropic finance as well as borrowing from international capital markets; and 
d) International - public: Official Development Assistance (ODA), Other Official Flows (OOF) and South-South Cooperation (SSC).
The mobilization of these financial resources has been made possible through the public finance management system and the public policy influenced financial system. Through the public finance management, the government raises funds from both domestic and foreign sources and allocates them for economically and socially productive investments. The evolution of the main flows that have been utilised by Fiji from 2005 up to 2017. The four main flows constitute the financial flows that were available for Fiji’s development between 2005 and 2017. It shows that these four categories of flows amounted to 50 - 60% of GDP since 2010. 
Domestic public flows include mainly public revenue from domestic sources. Since 2005, Fiji has gradually improved its public revenue collection. The volume of domestic public revenue has increased from 23.9% of GDP in 2005 to 30.5% of GDP in 2017. This improvement has been achieved through transforming into broad based tax system, modernising the tax and custom services, and improving compliance. Fiji is implementing public sector reforms to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of public sector expenditure through reducing inefficiency in the public sector, including reducing subsidy and transfer to SOEs and improving SOE performance, better aligning with national development priorities, and improving public finance management. Fiji is also leveraging public finance to attract private sector investment, such as promoting PPP projects in providing public service and in reforming SOEs.
Domestic private flows include mainly domestic gross saving, which are mobilized through domestic financial sector for private sector investment. Since 2005, the volume of domestic private flows has been increasing as well. In 2017, gross domestic saving accounts for 15% of GDP in 2017, rising from 7.1% of GDP in 2005. 
Compared globally, Fiji’s gross domestic saving rate is still low, especially when compared with East-Asia and upper middle income countries. A number of factors may contribute to the level of domestic saving, including the level and growth of the economy, financial stability, level of real interest rate, the depth of financial sector, financial inclusion, financial literacy, coverage of social security etc. Policies are needed to encourage domestic saving and investment through financial inclusion and deepening of financial services that can initiate a virtuous growth-saving circle by fostering growth through fiscal consolidation, structural reform, financial liberalisation as well as the development of long-term saving instruments.
Foreign Private flows include remittance, FDI, Portfolio investment, and Impact Investments. This flow has witnessed some degree of decline since 2005. In 2017, the volume of foreign private flows amounted to 11.3% of GDP, dropping from 16.5% of GDP in 2010. This is mainly due to the decline in foreign investment in recent years, while the volume of remittance has been increasing. This flow represents the biggest opportunity for Fiji to increase its finance available for development from external sources. Fiji has already put in place tax incentives, established economic zones, and simplified business registration processes to encourage FDI and will be reviewing the foreign investment legislation to address barriers and encourage FDI. With initiatives in place to promote remittances, further work on policy and financial products space is required including the need to develop programs to utilise Fiji diaspora’s human capital and business networks developed while working overseas.

and SSCs, greater donor coordination Domestic Credits to Private Sector and Public Debts (% of GDP), 2000-2017 and alignment with national development priorities is required. There is also a need to develop mechanisms to blend ODAs and SSCs with other types of finances to fund development projects when appropriate. 
In addition to these four main categories of development financial flows, both the public sector and private sector can also seek finance from domestic and international financial markets, which also include multilateral 	or 	bilateral 	concessionary loans. The evolution of domestic credits to private sector and the level of public sector Foreign Public flows include ODA and SSC. This flow has fluctuated around 3% of GDP, which may remain at this level in the short term and may decline in the long term as Fiji improves its economic development. The current ODA and SSC are in general fragmented and donor led, and around 50% of them are not on the budget. To improve the effectiveness of ODAs debt. Both flows are debt generating flows, which tend to increase private and public sector’s risk profiles and affect their financial stability. 
Public debt level at 47% of GDP until 2021, and then reduce it gradually to 45% by 2026, 40% by 2031, and 35% by 2036. As a result, Fiji may have to reduce its public debt level in the next 10-20 years, which leaves the government of Fiji little space to utilize debt generating financial instruments.
On the other hand, the depth of Fiji’s financial sector is comparatively shallow. The ratio of Fiji’s domestic credit to private sector to GDP is low when compared with upper middle income countries on average and OECD countries. In 2017, Fiji’s ratio of domestic credit to private sector to GDP was 20 percentage points lower than the average in upper middle income countries. This indicates that domestic private financial resources are underutilized, which may represent opportunities for the private sector to utilize this resource more intensively and extensively through deepening financial sector and improving financial sector performance, which will facilitate the allocation of resources to the areas where it can contribute the most.

Climate Finance
As a country on the frontlines of climate change adversities, Fiji is well placed to explore the wider use of international climate finance for adaptation, resilience building and mitigation purposes. Assessing vulnerability to climate change therefore is important for defining the risks posed by climate change and provides information for identifying adaptation measures. It enables practitioners and decision-makers to identify the most vulnerable areas, sectors and social groups. This in turn means, climate adaptation options targeted at specified contexts are developed and implemented.
Fiji’s Climate Vulnerability Assessment (CVA) developed with technical assistance from the World Bank highlights that the Fijian Government must make interventions in five key areas to reduce vulnerability. The CVA proposes an adaptation and resilience plan with cost estimates and a comprehensive list of interventions that can help connect the adaptation challenge to investment needs and financing options. The interventions are (i) Building inclusive and resilient towns and cities; (ii) Improving
