EXECUTIVE  SUMMARY 
Introduction
 	 
Lesotho	is	highly	committed	to	the	implementation	of	the	2030	Agenda	for	Sustainable	Development.	This commitment is operationalised through the National Strategic Development Plan II (NSDP II), 2018/19	–	2022/23.	The	NSDP	II	is	also	aligned	with	the	African	Union	Agenda	2063	and	the	SADC	Regional	Indicative	Strategic	Development	Plan.		SDGs	reflect	the	aspirations	of	Basotho	as	articulated	in	the	National	Vision	2020,	living	in	a	country	of	stable	democracy,	united	and	prosperous	nation at peace with itself and its neighbours, with a healthy and educated human resource base. Access to inclusive and quality education and health services, safe drinking water and basic sanitation will be guaranteed. The principle of “Leave No One Behind” is core to national values and development imperatives.
Lesotho	recognizes	the	transformative	goal	of	2030	Agenda	for	Sustainable	Development.	The	country is also committed to other global frameworks including the Paris Agreement, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, Istanbul Programme of Action, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR). Lesotho has domesticated (nationalized) SDGs and mainstreamed them in the country´s new development framework. Therefore, the implementation of SDGs will be part and parcel of accelerating the following: i) decent and productive employment creation and inclusive economic growth; ii) a further energized and dynamic private sector; iii) a modernized public service that supports the private sector and is anchored on the principle of “people-centred development”; and iv) good governance and accountability system. 
Lesotho recognizes that the achievement of SDGs requires effective multi-stakeholder partnerships, consultations	and	monitoring	of	and	reporting	on	progress	made	in	addressing	2030	Agenda.	The	Agenda is not just for and about government initiatives, it involves national multi-stakeholder participation including the private sector, civil society organizations, women’s groups, children, youth, academia and other special groups, communities and local government and the media. The participation of the UN and other development partners is also critical. Therefore, effective national high level leadership and coordination coupled with effective public and private institutions is key to the country´s success in the implementation of the SDGs, within the existing national frameworks.

Review Process
Led	by	the	Government,	the	Lesotho	VNR	2019	was participatory and inclusive, including all levels and sectors of government, the private sector,	civil	society/NGOs,	academia,	women	and youth, and the media for ownership and awareness creation towards SDGs. A National VNR	Conference	was	held	to	validate	the	findings of the VNR followed by a presentation to the	Cabinet	for	approval	before	final	submission and presentation at the HLPF. In the spirit of “Leaving No One Behind” the Lesotho	VNR	2019	drew	contributions	across	different sectors and institutions including government Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), development partners, the private sector,	academia,	CSOs/NGOs,	women’s	groups,	people with disabilities, youth, and children. The National University of Lesotho (NUL), played a think-tank role and was tasked with producing analytical reports on six (6) SDGS under review. International SDG VNR Consultant was also engaged to provide technical support to the review	and	guide/facilitate	stakeholders´	consultations, review and consolidate background papers	and	finally	the	Lesotho	2019	VNR	report. Policy and Enabling Environment
Lesotho has mainstreamed regional and international commitments into the national priorities.	These	include:	2030	Agenda	for	Sustainable	Development,	AU	Agenda	2063,	and	SADC RISDP. This commitment is facilitated through the National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP II) 2018/19-2022/23. The NSDP II is the instrument through which Lesotho National	Vision	2020	is	pursued.	This	is	defined	through four key priorities areas: i. Promoting Inclusive and Sustainable Growth, ii. Strengthening Human Capital through investment in Health, Nutrition, Skills development, Social protection and Migration, iii. Building Enabling infrastructure, iv. Strengthening Governance and Accountability. 
The plan puts emphasis on private sector development and gives priority to pursuing people centred development. It re-enforces the Government’s commitment to further bring development to the people of Lesotho by empowering them to participate fully in the development process, thereby preserving their dignity by uplifting their potential to partake in the prosperity that	will	be	generated	in	the	next	five	years.	The	GoL recognizes that the targets of the NSDP II, and subsequently SDGs, will be achieved only if the economy is supported by macroeconomic stability, peace and effective institutions, which are a pre-condition for economic growth and private sector development. As such, strengthening macroeconomic resilience, combating climate change, producing healthy and educated	human	capital,	effective	public	finance	management (PFM), governance and coordination, are imperatives for Lesotho`s development. 
The Government of Lesotho, through a consultation process, created Sustainable Development Coordination structure and mechanism. The national institutional architecture and coordination mechanism builds on the existing government structures and also includes accountability institutions such as the Parliament. The highest structure is the National Oversight and Advisory Committee, chaired by the Right Honourable the Prime Minister. 
The Cabinet sub-committee on SDGs chaired by the Honourable Minister of Development Planning aims to ensure effective coordination, advocacy, implementation and monitoring of sustainable development agenda. 
The National Technical Steering Committee for the implementation of sustainable development agenda is chaired by the Principal Secretary for Ministry of Development Planning, with a multi-stakeholder membership including: Ministries Principal Secretaries (PSs), UN Country Team (UNCT), Development Partners, Heads of Government Agencies, Heads of CSOs, Heads of NGOs; Chief Executives, and Heads of Trade 
Unions. Its responsibility is to give technical direction and quality assurance to the implementation, monitoring of and reporting on SDGs. 
Status of SDG Progress
Lesotho recognizes the interrelatedness and indivisibility nature of SDGs. Addressing the indivisible SDGs requires effective institutions and access to justice (SDG 16) and partnerships,	including	financial	resources	(SDG	17).	In addition to the 6 (six) SDGs reviewed in depth in this report, Lesotho decided to highlight progress made in SDGs 1 and 2 as they relate to the ultimate goal of the NSDP II.

The GoL has successfully reduced absolute	poverty	in	the	last	five	years.	Between	2002/2003	and	2017/2018,	Lesotho’s	overall	national poverty and extreme poverty headcount ratios declined from 56.6 percent to 49.7 percent and from 34.1 to 24.1 percent. A change in the level of inequality was also recorded during the same period. Gini index was 
51.9	in	2002/2003	and	fell	by	6.3	Gini	points	to	44.6	in	2017/2018.	But	about	65.4	percent	of	all	children	(aged	0-17	years)	are	multi-dimensionally poor.
Going forward, Lesotho prioritizes reducing poverty levels and inequalities (nationally and in the districts) by rolling out and sustaining	the	gains	of	the	last	five	years	using	evidence-based and result-based management. These will be achieved by, among others, enhancing food security, improving agricultural productivity through research and development, use of technology, optimizing agriculture land use, encouraging and supporting smart and	precision	agriculture/farming.

Food and nutrition insecurity in Lesotho is related to poor performance and low productivity in the agriculture sector. The population at risk of food insecurity in Lesotho varies each year	with	a	projection	of	640,000	people	to	be	food	insecure	during	the	period	of	July	2019	to	June	2020.	This	is	due	to	a	combination	of	droughts,	lack	of	financial	resources	(due	to	rising poverty) to purchase inputs to increase productivity, and land degradation. Moreover, weak management of the sector and limited extension service delivery to farmers contribute to sub-optimal application of modern agricultural methods, pest and disease outbreaks (such as army-worm infestations), limited grazing land and stock theft. Although chronic and acute malnutrition	has	declined	since	2004,	the	nutrition situation in Lesotho is characterised by high stunting rates in children under the age of five	years,	wide-spread	micro-nutrient	deficiencies in children, adolescents and adults, overweight and obesity in some segments of the population, and the growing incidence of diet related non-communicable diseases (NCDs) which are costing lives and imposing a burden on the health budget. Going forward Lesotho will focus on the following:
• Reducing poverty levels and inequalitiesacross the country, by rolling out and sustaining the	gains	of	the	last	five	years	and	using	evidence-based and result-based management.
• Enhancing food security, by improving productivity through research and development, use of technology, optimizing agriculture land use, encouraging and supporting smart and precision agriculture/farming.
• Funding, effectively implementing and monitoring the economic, social and environmental programmes articulated in the NSDP II.
• Mobilizing	financial	and	human	resources	for	NSDP II though national, regional and international partnerships.
• Balancing	social	protection/humanitarian	assistance	with	development	agenda	–	building	community and households resilience.
• Effectively implementing and monitoring of “Renewed Efforts Against Child Hunger and Undernutrition”	–	REACH-	initiatives.
• Strengthening of health systems and nutrition programmed for attainment of good health.

Lesotho recognizes that inclusive and quality education and training, together with health (SDG 3), is part of human capital development and critical enabler for achieving sustainable development in the country. 
Lesotho is almost achieving universal primary education	(UPE),	with	gender	parity	(GER	0.95	and	NER	1.0).	Pre-primary	enrolment	(children	aged	3-5)	stands	at	30	percent	(2017),	with	49.9	percent	male	while	50.1	percent	were	female. Over the years, there has been a growth in both the Net Enrolment Rate (NER) and the Gross Enrolment Rate (GER). Primary school net enrolment rate is 87 percent (female 86.9 percent	and	male	87.1	percent)	(2017).	Net	Secondary School enrolment rare is 43.3 percent with female at 52.1 percent and male 34.6 percent	(2017).	There	are	regional	variations	and disparities, with poorer districts recording lower enrolments in basic education. The situation is worse for children with disabilities, herd boys	and	OVCs	–	child	headed	households.
The Government notes concerns relating to capacity challenges of Technical and Vocational Education Training (TVET) institutions in terms of availability of space, suitability of curriculum provided and quality of assessment mechanism. In order to ensure that every Mosotho has access to affordable and quality technical and vocational education, the Government adopted	the	TVET	policy	in	May	2019.	Promoting	access to higher education is one of the policy goals of the sector.  However, this has proved to be a big challenge which needs to be addressed to ensure access to higher education by eligible people. This is evidenced by declining enrolments in almost all Higher Education Institutions (HEIs).
Lesotho has one public university and two private universities. Enrolments in registered higher	institutions	in	2015/16	decreased	to	21,586	students	compared	to	21,664	in	2014/15.	There	were	more	female	learners	at	60.5	percent	compared with their male counterparts at 39.5 percent.
Going forward, Lesotho will focus on addressing	the	challenge	of	financial	gap	and	good	expenditure mix between recurrent and development	expenditure.	It	will	also	address	efficiency	and effectiveness in resource allocation and use, in particular targeting inclusive pre-primary and secondary education sub-sectors. The country will focus on improving secondary school enrolment for boys and girls through actions such as school fee subsidies, addressing teenage pregnancy and child marriage by ensuring that girls have access to information and health services, supporting menstrual health and management, and implementing zero tolerance for violence policies at school level. Focus on improving the quality of education at all levels is also critical, through investment in teaching-learning infrastructure and facilities, teacher development and monitoring learning outcomes. It is also critical for the country to strengthen collection, analysis and use of disaggregated	data	on	education	–	including	down	to	district	level	–	as	effective	and	timely	collection of sex, gender and diversity disaggregated data is critical for analysis, monitoring, evaluation, and evidence-based policy making.

Lesotho has a potential to be a strong and prosperous nation capable of robust economic growth and jobs creation. This is demonstrated by its macro-economic policy and programmes which have been largely conducive for strong economic	growth.	In	the	1970´s	and	1980s,	the	gross domestic product (GDP) grew at annual average of 8 percent. Annual GDP has been growing by an average of 4.5 percent between 2008	and	2014,	which	was	40	percent	faster	than the average in the sub-Saharan Africa. 
Since	the	adoption	of	the	SDGs	in	2015,	Lesotho has not been able to achieve the set target of 5 percent annual growth rate.  The country’s growth rate is also below the global growth of 3.7 percent and the average growth rate sub-Saharan	African	region	of	3.1	percent	in	2018.	During	the	period	2013-2018,	the	annual	GDP	grew	at	a rate of 1.9 percent on average. This is lower than the growth rate of 2.2 percent achieved during	the	period	2013-2015.
The rate of unemployment increased from 25.8 percent	in	the	second	quarter	of	2014/15	to	32.8	percent	in	the	second	quarter	of	2015/16.	More	women are unemployed compared to men. There are also regional disparities, where there are more unemployed people in poorer districts. Young people are disproportionally affected by unemployment and experience high rates of inactivity, unemployment and low access to earning opportunities, with unemployment rate of 29 percent males and 34 percent for females.
The creation of additional decent jobs and faster economic growth are primary determiners of poverty alleviation in Lesotho. The Government is therefore committed to promote inclusive economic growth and private sector-led job	creation	in	the	next	five	years	and	beyond	as demonstrated by the Big Fast Results (BFR) approach to investment focusing on the four NSDP II priority sectors namely; agriculture, manufacturing, tourism and creative industries and technology and innovation.  Other areas of focus include: creation of enabling environment and supporting the growth of local trade, micro-and small-business in all the districts; developing policies that promote local traders; creation of a conducive socio-cultural and policy environment that is sensitive to women, adolescents, youth and people with disabilities; policies such Youth Policy and legislation such as Domestic Violence Bill and Disability Equity Bill need to be fully operationalized by the responsible line ministries. Investing more in women empowerment programmes will facilitate their entry into the labour market. This will also ensure their protection from abuse and their Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) needs are adequately met to increase their productivity. 

The GoL recognizes and appreciates the fact that there are many Basotho (children, adolescent, people with disabilities, youth, women, and elderly, and special groups like Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex (LGBTI Community)) across the country who are vulnerable.	If	these	groups	are	not	specifically	targeted they will continue to lack choices and opportunities required to actively participate and	benefit	from	development	progress.	
Lesotho has a relatively robust social protection system. These include the following: Promoting Gender Equality and Women´s Empowerment (GEWE), Child Protection, empowering Adolescents and Youth, Child Grants Programme, OVC Bursary, Programme for People with Disabilities and Migrants, Old age pension and building community and households economic resilience. Strengthening national and district coordination structures and mechanisms to effectively address inequalities and effectively manage social protection programmes across the country remain a key area of focus, together with collecting, analysing and usage of disaggregated data by age, sex, gender, regions 

and socio-economic status among others. Supporting and strengthening routine social protection and emergency response mechanisms is a critical factor. Moreover, the country will focus on addressing in a comprehensive and inclusive manner the challenges of health, HIV and AIDS and Gender Based Violence (GBV), sexual abuse and violence at home, at work and in learning institutions. The use of credible and up-to-date data; and allocation of adequate	resources	(financial	and	human)	for	GEWE programmes, including Gender Responsive Budgeting (across MDA and local government) remain critical going forward.

Lesotho is highly vulnerable to adverse impact of climate change due to its location, size and topography. Climate change and environmental degradation represent a great threat to Lesotho´s implementation of SDGs, and in particular addressing poverty, hunger and creating decent jobs and stimulating economic growth (SDGs 1, 2, 8, 9). The challenges of climate change also hinder the country from reducing inequality	(SDG	10),	promoting	gender	equality (SDG 5) and protecting the environment and promoting sustainable development (SDGs 6, 7, 11, 12, 14 and 15). In the past ten years, Le sotho has experienced successive and cyclic climate shocks such as recurrent droughts, dry spells	and	floods,	which	have	negatively	affected communities and households’ livelihoods, with serious consequences on food security. 
The droughts have also contributed to an increase in internal displacement and migration. Migration	has	been	identified	as	one	of	the	coping mechanism during the drought. There is a highly mobile cohort of women (52 percent) compared to men (47 percent) in Lesotho. Migration of women to South Africa in search of jobs means that they have to leave children behind with husband or relatives and in some cases children are left as heads of households and are exposed to abuse. 
Lesotho has established policy and institutional frameworks to address and manage climate change effects, including the development of the National Strategic Resilience Framework 2015-2025,	the	National	Climate	Change	Policy	(NCCP),	2017-2027;	Energy	Policy	2015-	2025.		Effective	implementation	of	these	policies	and	programmes	will	be	significant	in	achieving SDGs. Lesotho therefore needs continued support and partnerships to be able to effectively combat climate change and build effective community and households resilience, including capacity to build early warning systems, relevant technologies and capacity building on development of proposals for bankable projects for climate change adaptation and mitigation.

Lesotho is committed to good governance, pursuit of peaceful and inclusive societies and access to justice for all while building effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels. Albeit its chequered history of episodes of instability and political unrest, the search for peace and stable institutions that will support sustainable and inclusive development have been paramount endeavours of the people of Lesotho. Lesotho is on the road to creating lasting and sustained stability. The national dialogue and reform agenda engagements and consultations are on course as articulated in the Government’s blue print “The Lesotho We Want: Dialogue and Reforms for National Transformation – Vision, Overview and Roadmap”. 
Lesotho	has	made	significant	strides	towards	the improvement of conditions of prisons and places of detention. The country has embarked on several legal and institutional reforms in order to address different forms of Illicit Financial Flows (IFFs) and reduce corruption and bribery of all forms across the country. It is committed to ensuring that there is responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-mak ing at all levels. At the international level, Lesotho	ratified,	among	others,	the	Convention	on	the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) in 1995, Convention on the Rights of a Child (1992) and International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families	(2005).	It	has	put	in	place;	Children	Protection	and	Welfare	Act,	2011,	the	Registration of Births and Deaths Act 1973, the National Identity	Cards	Act	2011,	Education	Act	2010,	Lesotho Citizenship Order 1971 and Lesotho Passports and Travel Documents Act 1998. Article 14 (1) of the Constitution of Lesotho protects the freedom of access to information and disseminating it. But there are limitations to this clause as stipulated in Article 14(2) of the Constitution.
Going forward, Lesotho´s priorities include: Building national and local level peace architecture which include peace and stability institutions and platforms at all levels; Strengthening the judiciary: special courts including Children’s Court, increasing relevant human resources, including the number of judges and other	legal	officers;	and	addressing	the	data/ evidence challenge and fast-tracking initiatives on ending child marriage across the country.

Lesotho has learned that mobilizing partnerships from various sectors and promoting inclusive engagement and multi-stakeholder consultations and participation, is not only critical for prioritization of SDGs, but is also necessary for monitoring and reporting on progress made on implementing the goals. Such partnerships can be built through involvement of MDAs, the private sector, CSOs, UN and other development partners, and special groups like children, adolescent, youth, women, and people with disabilities.
Lesotho has partnership policy that is being reviewed and is the process of developing a national partnership and coordination strategic plan to strengthen engagement mechanisms with all partners and structures including development partners, civil society, the private sector and special groups. Processes for resuscitation	of	major	financing	arrangement,	Millennium challenge Corporation in the US, in particular, has been rebooted and programme preparatory funds have been approved.
The country has a mixed picture in internal resource mobilization. Total government revenue was	about	54	percent	of	GDP	in	2010,	44	per cent	of	GDP	in	2012	and	46	percent	of	GDP	in	2015.	In	2017,	it	was	about	36	percent	of	GDP.	The GoL´s efforts to mobilize resources for the implementation of SDGs is further hampered by	the	decline	in	other	sources	of	financial	resources, particularly, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)	and	Official	Development	Assistance	(ODA). FDI’s increased from about 1percent of	GDP	in	2010	to	about	13	percent	in	2015.	However, it has since dropped to about 4.8 percent	of	GDP	in	2017.	The	ODA	increased	from	about	58	percent	of	the	budget	in	2010	to	about	96	percent	of	the	budget	in	2013.	In	2015,	ODA	was about 88 percent of the domestic budget, and it dropped further to reach about 76 percent	of	the	budget	in	2017.	
The	Government	is	developing	fiscal	adjustment reform programme to regain sustainability. In an effort to contain the balancing wage bill, public sector census has been undertaken to identify human capital capacity needs. Going forward, strengthening Public Finance Management (PFM) and accountability across government MDAs is critical. 
To increase revenue base, Lesotho has to come up with new innovative sources of revenue. Lesotho has to take advantage of lucrative markets in the EU member states, under EU and ACP Partnership Agreement; and USA through AGOA; and venture into other trade deals regionally and internationally. However, this needs building effective national partnership	and	coordination	structure/mechanism	with focus on effective governance and prudent financial	management.
 
Conclusions and Next Steps
Lesotho is committed to fast-tracking the implementation of SDGs and working with various partners, including communities, children, youth and special groups, to achieve the three dimensions	of	Agenda	2030	being:	economic,	social and environmental. Lesotho has demonstrated that this is possible. The nation has already mainstreamed SDGs in the NSDP II. 

The effective funding, implementation, monitoring and reporting on NSDP II targets is a sure way of effective implementation of SDGs. Lesotho commits that it will develop effective coordination and monitoring structures and mechanisms to bridge the data gap and make accountability part of SDGs national, regional and international reporting.
Lesotho’s	participation	in	the	2019	VNR	process has been a good learning experience for the Government across MDAs, the private sector, CSOs, academia, and special groups like children, the youth, women and people with disabilities. Through this process, advocacy, public education and awareness about SDGs across	districts	in	Lesotho	–	rural	and	urban,	and among various stakeholders, have been reinforced.  What remains critical is that the country’s effective implementation of NSDP II and SDGs lies in sustaining political stability and increased good governance, mobilizing and harnessing existing resources, and innovation and use of technology. This will require strong leadership, effective coordination, and sustained monitoring and reporting on the progress Lesotho is making on people-centred development. 
The	Lesotho	VNR	2019,	and	the	multi-stakeholder consultations and engagement in particular, revealed that for the country to effectively	achieve	2030	Agenda	and	the	Agenda	2063,	it	should	address	the	following	three	imperatives:
i. Taking effective action to combat climate change and its effects by building community and households´ resilience, implementing effective adaptation measures, supporting and protecting agriculture sector and addressing rural poverty and inequalities of all forms;
ii. Building strong health systems and addressing new HIV infections among the adolescent, youth and factory workers; and 
iii. Accomplishing the Lesotho National Dialogue and Reform Agenda, thus promoting stability and peaceful and inclusive society, with strong and effective institutions.
Lesotho will put more emphasis on evidence-based decision making and planning, monitoring and evaluation. Financial prudency, effective citizen engagement and enhancement of accountability at national and district levels, will be strengthened to become part of implementation of NSDP II and SDGs. The Kingdom of Lesotho is committed to undertaking annual reviews of the SDGs as a means of holding the Government accountable for the achievement of this transformative Agenda.

By the year 2020 Lesotho shall be a stable democracy, a united and prosperous nation at peace with itself and its neighbours. It shall have a healthy and well-developed human resource base. Its economy will be strong, its environment well managed and its technology well established. (National Vision 2020)

1.0 INTRODUCTION 
Lesotho is highly committed to the implementation	of	the	2030	Agenda	for	Sustainable	Development. This commitment is operationalised through the National Strategic Development Plan	II	(NSDP	II),	2018/19	–	2022/23.	The	
NSDP II is also aligned with the African Union Agenda	2063	and	the	SADC	Regional	Indicative	Strategic	Development	Plan.		SDGs	reflect	the aspirations of Basotho, that are articulated in	National	Vision	2020,	living	in	a	country	of	stable democracy, united and prosperous nation at peace with itself and its neighbours, with a healthy and educated human resource base. The principle of “Leave No One Behind” is core to national values and development imperatives.
Lesotho recognizes the interrelatedness and indivisibility nature of SDGs. For example, with effective implementation of programmes on climate change mitigation and adaptation (SDG 13), Lesotho will reduce poverty and hunger and create decent jobs (SDGs 1, 2, 8), and reduce inequalities and gender based violence (SDGs 10,	5).	With	reduced	poverty,	hunger	and	increased decent jobs, Basotho will have access to improved universal health and education services (SDG 3, 4), clean water and sanitation and affordable energy (SDG 6, 7). Addressing the indivisibility nature of SDGs requires effective institutions and access to justice (SDG 16) and effective partnerships, including adequate	financial	resources	(SDG	17).	It	is	from	this understanding that Lesotho developed the National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP II), which is human development oriented and an instrument for prioritisation, implementation, monitoring and reporting on SDGs.
Throughout Lesotho´s 52 years of independence, there have been a number of development strategies, resulting in important development gains for the people: children, adolescent, youth, women and men including the vulnerable groups: people with disabilities, orphans, and returned migrants. The most recent, NSDP I	(2012/13	to	2016/17)	implementation	resulted	

into an uneven performance and disappointing development results. Nonetheless, there were four main areas of encouraging accomplishments that the country is building upon, replicating and extending under NSDP II, namely: (1) Emerging dynamism in Lesotho’s private sector; (2) Emerging consensus on embarking upon public sector modernization; (3) Effective interface between development partners and line ministries; and (4) Emerging progress and shortfalls at Ministry level; and huge progress on Social Protection.  
While some progress was made towards attainment of the strategic goals set out in the NSDP I, several challenges, some of which were outside the control of the country, impeded the full realization of NSDP I goals and targets. These included the following:1 (1) chronic political uncertainty that resulted in politicization of civil service management; (2) Institutional fragmentation and lack of coordination; (3) NSDP design	flaws	concerning	poverty	reduction	and	employment creation, (4) weak link between NSDP priorities and spending patterns; (5) the fall of donor support, and; (6) untimely monitoring and evaluation and weak implementation management.	These	challenges/weaknesses	provided	lessons	that	were	reflected	in	the	design of NSDP II, which gives a sharper focus on the potential strategies that can accelerate the achievement of “people-centred development”. The overall target of NSDP II is, therefore, employment creation and achievement of inclusive economic growth. The achievement of these macro targets are believed to ultimately lead to poverty reduction, social inclusion and protection of the environment in the country. This	ties	with	2030	Agenda	for	Sustainable	Development.
Lesotho recognizes the transformative goal of 2030	Agenda	for	Sustainable	Development.	The country is also committed to other global frameworks including the Paris Agreement, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, Istanbul Programme of Action, the Sendai Framework for Risk Reduction. Lesotho has domesticated (nationalized) SDGs and mainstreamed them in the country´s new development framework. Therefore, the implementation of SDGs will be part and parcel of accelerating: i) decent and productive employment creation and inclusive economic growth; ii) a further energized and dynamic private sector; iii. a modernized public service that supports the private sector and is anchored on the principle of “people-centred development”, and; iv) good governance and accountability system. 
Lesotho recognizes that the achievement of SDGs requires effective multi-stakeholder partnerships, consultations and monitoring of and reporting	on	progress	made	in	addressing	2030	Agenda. The Agenda is not just for and about government initiatives, rather it involves national multi-stakeholder participation that includes the private sector, civil society organizations, women’s groups, children, youth, academia and other special groups, communities, local government and the media. The participation of the UN and other development partners is also critical. Therefore, effective national high level leadership and coordination, coupled with effective public and private institutions, is key for the country´s success in the implementation of the SDGs within the existing national frame works.

Multistakeholders consultation for the 6 goalsThe Government of Lesotho (GoL) has shown commitment of working with multi-stakeholder	groups	in	the	2019	Voluntary	National	Review (VNR) process. Through this process, the Government has learned important lessons and opened a new chapter in its development agenda. Top of the list is that Basotho and their partners/friends	have	to	face	the	development	challenges together, and commit to act and address them together, faster and in a sustainable way. Engagements during the Lesotho National SDGs	VNR	Validation	Conference	2019,	highlighted Lesotho’s good progress on domestication and implementation of SDGs. However, this has not been “faster and bigger” as is expected	by	Basotho,	especially	the	bottom	40	per cent, the vulnerable groups, the youth and special groups like people with disabilities and those affected by climate change and HIV and AIDs effects. Basotho´s expectations, going forward, is a more coordinated, well-funded and innovative approaches and practical initiatives that will produce bigger and sustainable outcomes and impacts.
This Report outlines the progress Lesotho has made in addressing development concerns and social issues, in particular the journey towards in the implementation of SDGs. Lesotho VNR	2019	Report	has	been	guided	by	2019	VNR theme “Empowering people and ensuring inclusiveness and equality”. Apart from setting the stage in the introduction, Chapter II describes the methodology and process used	in	Lesotho	VNR	2019.	Chapter III presents policy and enabling environment, including Leave No One Behind initiatives. Chapter IV	presents	the	progress	on	the	focus	of	2019	VNR	-	SDGs	4,	8,	10,	13,	16	and	17,	integrated	with other SDGs.  Chapter V, discusses means of implementation of SDGs in Lesotho, in particular, the framework and strategy for mobilizing	financial	resources.	Chapter VI presents conclusions, key sector messages, challenges and the next steps towards fast-tracking implementation, monitoring and reporting on SDGs in Lesotho.
2.0 METHODOLOGY AND PROCESS OF PREPARATION OF THE REVIEW
Following the Government of Lesotho’s decision	to	participate	in	2019	VNR,	the	Ministry	of	Developing Planning (MDP) was mandated to coordinate the VNR processes which involved reaching out to stakeholders, advocacy, sensitization and providing guidelines. With the leadership of the Honourable Minister for Development Planning, a technical team lead by the Principal Secretary (PS) was responsible for collecting and collating all inputs from various stakeholders. 
The	Lesotho	VNR	2019	followed	a	participatory	and inclusive process covering all levels and sectors of Government, the private sector, civil society/NGOs,	academia,	women	and	youth,	and the media, for ownership and awareness creation towards SDGs. A National VNR Con ference	was	held	to	validate	the	findings	of	the	VNR, which was later presented to the Lesotho Cabinet	for	approval	before	final	submission	and presentation at the High Level Political Forum (HLPF). 
Lesotho	2019	VNR	process	was	undertaken	within the existing national structures of planning, monitoring and reporting. A Lesotho VNR 2019	coordination	and	technical	committee	was formed, chaired by the Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Development Planning. The committee developed VNR road-map, including stakeholders´ consultation plan, timelines and outputs. The process commenced with sensitisation of the nation about the exercise, as part of requirements to monitor and report on the implementation of NSDP II and SDGs. The process was widely supported by various development partners and other stakeholders to support the review process. 
In the spirit of “Leaving No One Behind” the Lesotho	VNR	2019	drew	contributions	from	across different sectors and institutions including government MDAs, Lesotho UN, EU Commission and other development partners, the private	sector,	academia,	SCOs/NGOs,	women groups, the people with disabilities, youth, and children. The process engaged National University of Lesotho (NUL) that played a thinktank role and produced analytical reports on the six (6) SDGs under review2 and technical support from UN system facilitate stakeholders´ consultations, review and consolidation of the	final	Lesotho	VNR	2019	Report.
The following stakeholders’ consultations were organized and facilitated by the MDP:
• Multi-stakeholder sensitisation workshop that also	agreed	on	the	2019	VNR	roadmap.
• Briefing	meeting	for	key	Government	Ministries responsible for implementation of the six 
SDGs under review.2
• CSOs and NGOs Consultation Workshop.
• A two-day Multi-Stakeholder Consultative Workshops on SDGs bringing together stakeholders from Government MDAs, Parliament, CSOs, women and youth groups, People With Disability (PWD), academia and media.
• Youth and Children VNR Consultation Workshop.
• The Private Sector VNR Consultation Workshop.
• Extended Cabinet Subcommittee on Sustainable Development meeting for presentation of progress on VNR process.
• Presentation of progress on VNR process to the National Assembly SDGs Committee. 
• Two-	day	Lesotho	VNR	2019	National	Conference for validation and ownership of the Report. This conference was organised in a panellist format which was preceded by presentations of the analytical reports on the six goals. It drew attendance and inputs from various stakeholders that include Government MDAs, the Par
liament, District Authorities, the Private Sector, 
UN	and	other	Development	Partners,	CSOs/ NGOs, Youth, Women’s Groups, PWD, academia and the media.  
• Media	briefing	on	National	TV	and	radio.
• Technical	VNR	2019	Planning	Committee	to	finalize	Lesotho	VNR	2019	Report.
The National VNR Validation Conference discussions were boosted by live-stream coverage through social media platform supported by Vodacom Lesotho outreaching to more than 2,000	people	across	the	country.	The	Conference was preceded by districts consultations with the support of UN Lesotho Youth Advisory Panel (UNYAP) engaging with citizens, including youth, adults, elderly, PWD and other marginalized groups on VNR and Lesotho´s progress towards the implementation of SDGs. The messages drawn from these consultations were presented at the Conference.

Youth raising issues of their concern at the consultation workshop

To support the multi-stakeholder engagement of	the	Lesotho	VNR	2019	and	to	drive	innovative approaches in engaging citizens as well as using new forms of data to track progress in SDGs, the MDP, supported by the UN Lesotho, engaged in two novel initiatives: a social media network analysis and a real time monitoring of citizen perceptions. Both initiatives were aimed at crowdsourcing progress, sentiments and gain insights towards the perceived change in the status-quo of SDGs. Additionally, using both initiatives allowed for a retrospective analysis of the public discourse surrounding SDGs but also enabled a direct feedback on areas of question. 
Availability of quality data is fundamental for monitoring progress towards the attainment of the SDGs, and ensuring accountability within government and across sectors. The Lesotho Bureau of Statistics (BoS), as the custodian of official	statistics,	supplied	most	of	the	data	used	during the Review. The data was also supplemented by the Lesotho SDGs indicator Baseline Report and other baseline studies.3
3.0 POLICY AND ENABLING ENVIRONMENT
3.1 Incorporation of the SDGs in National 
Frameworks
Lesotho has mainstreamed the regional and international commitments into its national priorities.	These	include:	2030	Agenda	for	Sustainable	Development,	Agenda	2063,	and	SADC	Regional Indicative Strategic Development 
 Figure 3.1: NSDP II Pillars and SDGs 
Plan (RISDP). This commitment is facilitated through the National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP II) 2018/19-2022/23. The NSDP II is the instrument through which Lesotho National	Vision	2020	is	pursued,	and	is	defined	through four key priority areas (See Figure 3.1). Through NSDP II, Lesotho recognizes the integratedness and indivisiblity nature of SDGs and is committed to addressing the three dimensions of sustainable development: the economic, social and environmental. 

NSDP II is a centrepiece of all development efforts	in	Lesotho	for	the	next	five	years.	The	Plan	is	also	implementing	the	final	years	of	the	goals	set	out	in	the	National	Vision	2020.	It	has	identified	development	opportunities	which	are	key levers to getting Lesotho on a sustainable	development	path.	It	further	identifies	key	challenges (root causes) that hinder the country from achieving its potential output and the private sector development. By addressing the root causes of Lesotho’s underdevelopment, the country is positioning itself towards graduation from Least Developed Countries (LDCs). 
The Plan puts emphasis on private sector development and gives priority to pursuing people centred development. It re-enforces the Government’s commitment to bringing further development to the people of Lesotho by empowering them to participate fully in the development process, thereby preserving their dignity and uplifting their potential to partake in the prosperity that will be generated in the next five	years.	The	GoL	recognizes	that	the	goals	of the NSDP II, and subsequently SDGs, will be achieved only if the economy is supported by macroeconomic stability, peace and effective institutions, which are a pre-condition for economic growth and private sector development. As such, strengthening macroeconomic resilience, combating climate change, producing healthy and educated human capital, and effective governance and coordination are imperatives for development in Lesotho. 

3Kingdom of Lesotho Sustainable Development Goals Indicator Baseline Report, 2016. Lesotho Poverty Trends and Profile Report 2000/2003-2017/2018 (2019).Lesotho Government therefore emphasizes the necessity to pursue sustainable inclusive economic growth as the most effective route for poverty reduction and reducing inequalities across the country. Lesotho has therefore set out the growth strategy anchored on four productive sectors that have the greatest potential to create jobs and achieve sustainable inclusive growth. The four sectors were chosen on the basis of the following four features: • Job creation potential
• Inclusive economic growth potential
• Comparative advantage existence or potential• Sector’s multiplier effect or impact across multiple sectors.
3.2 Lesotho Response to “Leave No One 
Behind”

Sign Language interpretation for hearing impaired personsThe “Leave No One Behind” principle is a bedrock of Lesotho´s development state, especially with respect to legislation, governance, sustainable development considerations, and democratic institutions of the state.  Lesotho is commitment to promote Gender Equality and Women Empowerment (GEWE), as well as human rights in its development agenda and endeavours. The Constitution ensures 

the foundation for a non-racist, non-sexist and human right-based society where race, class, gender, sex, religion, diversity, age, social security and protection from harm, among others, are primary considerations.4 The GoL recognizes and appreciates the fact that there are many Basotho (children, adolescent, people with disabilities, youth, women, men and old people) across the country who are	vulnerable	and	if	not	specifically	targeted	they could lack choices and opportunities required	to	actively	participate	and	benefit	from	development progress. The Government has therefore put in place inclusive and empowering programmes and safety nets to support such people. Below are some highlights on these strategies
GoL recognizes and appreciates the fact that there are many Basotho (children, adolescent, people with disabilities, youth, women, men and old people) across the country who are vulnerable and if not specifically targeted they could lack choices and opportunities required to actively participate and benefit from development progress. 
3.2.1 GEWE for the SDGs Promoting gender equality and women´s empowerment (GEWE) is an imperative goal and strategy in Lesotho. The Government of Lesotho is committed to women´s empowerment. Compared to men, women constitute 51 percent of the country´s population hence gender has been mainstreamed in the NSDP II.  
Despite existing cultural and political dynamics, the GoL continues its commitment to develop gender responsive policies, programmes, plans and budgets. This is done to ensure improvements, progress and success on the following: i) prevention and eradication of sexual and	gender	–	based	violence	(SDG	5);	ii)	child	abuse and exploitation (SDGs 5, 16); iii) infant and maternal mortality (SDGs 3, 1, 2); iv) unequal division of unpaid care work, inequalities in the control over productive resources and inequalities in access to paid employment (SDGs 8,	10,	16);	v)food	insecurity	and	hunger	(SDGs	1, 2); gender disparity in decision-making positions (SDG 16). 
To	address	these	challenges	and	the	unfinished business of MDGs, the GoL through a participatory process developed a ten-year Gender	and	Development	(GAD)	Policy	20182028.	The	Policy	is	implemented	through	multi-sectoral approaches with the participation of all Government ministries, local authorities, CSOs, Faith Based Organizations (FBOs), academia, the private sector and development partners. 
The Policy is aligned to the international and regional instruments including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), SADC Protocol on Gender and Development, Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW); Beijing Declaration and Plan of Action; the Commonwealth Plan of Action	for	Gender	Equality	2005-2015,	AU	Protocol to the African Charter on Human and People’s Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa and AU Solemn Declaration on Gender Equali-
ty in Africa, among others. At the local level, it is aligned to the national frameworks such as the NSDP	and	the	National	Vision	2020.	Gender	equality forms a critical area of concern in the GAD Policy. 
Addressing Gender Based Violence (GBV): The GoL is committed to address domestic violence through various initiatives that include: o Developing capacities within the Disaster Management Authority (DMA) and the Lesotho Vulnerability Assessment Committee (LVAC) to address GBV in emergencies initiatives rolled out	over	the	2018-2019	Season;
Gender	focused	reviews	of	the	National	HIV/ AIDS Policy; 
•The Prevention and Eradication of Gender Inequality Programme; 
•The Domestic Violence Bill; •The Ending Child Marriage Act. 
•The Gender for Equality and Justice Assessment	(2016-2020)	leading	to	the	development	of key indicators for monitoring gender in Lesotho; and, 
•Establishment	of	a	national	simplified	and	integrated referral system for GBV survivors, and child protection.
The GoL and various groups recognize that more needs to be done to promote GEWE and reduce inequalities based on sex and gender in both the public, private and social spheres across the country. One major area is harmonization of customary laws with civil laws to remove inequalities and empower women economically, socially and politically.
3.2.2 Child Protection

4Lesotho Constitution, (1993)Children	(aged	0-17	years)	are	one	of	Lesotho´s greatest resource. They make up to half of the country´s population and every one of these children has the potential to make positive contribution to the future of the nation. For this to happen, children must be protected from violence, abuse, harm, exploitation and neglect so that they can grow to their fullest potential	(SDGs	1,	2,	3,	4,	10,	and	16).
The Government conducted a mapping and assessment of Lesotho´s child protection system in 2014, and in 2019 conducted VAC survey, that produced high level priority indicators to be used for decision making and programming on child protection across the country.
Lesotho enacted Children Protection and Welfare	Act	2011,	which	made	access	to	basic	services like education and health a human right. 4 The Government, with support from development partners, conducted a mapping and assessment of Lesotho´s child protection system in	2014,	and	in	2019.	The	Government	also	conducted Violence against Children (VAC) Survey.5 The survey produced high level priority indicators that are used for decision making and programming on children protection across the country.
The Government and other stakeholders, including advocacy groups, recognize the need to strengthen the ability to generate and use evidence for decision making, programming and monitoring impact of child protection interventions nationally and in the districts. They also recognize that there are structures at national and district levels to coordinate child protection responses. However, these structures need capacity enhancement to be able to, among others, produce credible disaggregated data, coordinate and monitor the effectiveness of the existing interventions on child protection and social protection. 
3.2.3 Youth for the SDGs
Lesotho has a young population, with about 
32 percent of population aged below 15, while those aged 15-34 years accounts for approximately 38 percent of the total population. 7With unemployment rate of about 25 percent and 36 percent estimated youth unemployment, youth population in Lesotho faces challenges that are multi-dimensional and interlinked. These challenges also include, incidence of HIV, limited sexual	and	reproductive	rights/health	services,	limited skills tailored to labour market needs and	access	to	finances.	Moreover,	low	completion rates for secondary education, limited opportunities for Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) exacerbates youth’s vulnerability. 
GoL and partners, put emphasis on the need for	macroeconomic	and	fiscal	policies	to	support measures that have the potential to create employment. In this regard, the Ministry of Gender, Youth, Sports and Recreation through the Department of Youth developed the National	Youth	Policy	2017-2030	(NYP)	in	collaboration with youth.  There is also an implementation plan to guide the execution of the Policy. The Policy aims to empower the youth by increasing their access to education and training (SDG 4), health services (SDG 3), decent jobs (SDG 1,2,8), leadership and political participation (SDG 16,17) and environmental protection programmes (SDG 6,7,11,13,14,15). Many efforts and studies have been carried out to understand the underlying issues facing young entrepreneurs through engagements at different platforms. 
3.2.4 Volunteers for the SDGs The Government recognizes volunteers as critical partners for the implementation of the 17 SDGs. This is seen as a strategy to promote broader national ownership, a human rightsbased approach, gender equality, participation, inclusion	and	sustainability.	Over	100	young	Basotho volunteered and offered services during	the	VNR	2019,	including	mobilization,	advocacy, and participating in consultation workshops.
The GoL’s recognition of the value addition of volunteer	action	dates	back	to	2009	as	demonstrated through the development and implementation of the National Volunteer Corps for young graduates’ project. This project enabled the country to retain new graduates from universities and vocational training institutions. Additionally, the intervention has impacted positively on employment opportunities, sustainable livelihood, household security, natural resource and environmental management. 
With about 38 percent of the population of Lesotho between the ages of 15 and 34 years, policies and programmes targeting youth are crucial as national strategies to ensure that no one is left behind in development planning and	implementation.	In	2015,	a	volunteer	programme that is aimed at enhancing youth engagement in development frameworks enabled young people’s involvement especially in the hard to reach rural communities. Furthermore, the programme enabled the country to leverage volunteer involving structures and networks to improve their collective contribution, inputs and coordination on the implementation of various SDGs.
From	2015,	through	formal	and	non-formal	structures, volunteers have been mobilized and are active across different development sectors and are contributing to various SDG related programmes. For example, 64 UN Volunteers have supported SDG related programmes in rural areas while community based volunteers, are the pillars for preventative health, hygiene, water and sanitation and food security interventions, which are critical sectors linked to SDGs 1, 2, 3 and 6.
3.2.5 Humanitarian Assistance to Vulnerable and at Risk Population (SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 13)
The vulnerability of Lesotho and the Basotho due to the effect of climate change, HIV and AIDS, political instability, and global economic melt-down has called for humanitarian assistance over the last decade. The GoL, supported by various development partners, the private sector, religious organizations and NGOs, has put in place various humanitarian response programmes and initiatives across the country.
 
The	2018	LVAC	reported	that	more	than	320,000	people	(50,000	in	urban	areas)	in	Lesotho would require humanitarian assistance during	the	2018/2019	lean	season.	6It is also estimated that the population at risk of food insecurity	will	increase	to	640,000	people	during	the	period	of	July	2019	to	June	2020.	The	country has put in place the National Drought Emergency	Response	Plan	2019	to	respond	to	the current drought effects. 
3.2.6. The National Information System for 
Social Assistance (NISSA)
The	Government	of	Lesotho	identified	the	need	to	increase	the	efficiency	and	coverage	of social protection programmes, to improve the institutional coordination, to harmonize legal frameworks, and to consolidate social assistance programmes across the country. The Government therefore established the National 
Information System for Social Assistance (NISSA). The NISSA is a single national integrated data platform for targeting that was developed with	financial	support	from	the	European	Union	(EU) and technical assistance from UNICEF and it is housed in the Ministry of Social Development (MoSD).
NISSA is a single national integrated national data platform for targeting, aimed at increasing the efficiency and coverage of social protection programmes, improve institutional coordination, harmonize legal frameworks, and consolidate social assistance programmed across the country.
It currently holds information on approximately 333,245 of Lesotho’s rural households and 64 community Councils. MoSD plans to expand NISSA coverage to 12 urban areas before end of	2019	where	a	further	estimated	216,000	households	reside.	The	poverty	classification	is	then	used	to	target	beneficiaries	of	MOSD	programs such as Child Grants Programme (CGP) and OVC Bursary program. NISSA in conjunction with delivery systems of CGP have subsequently been used to deliver an Emergency Grant and can be used to target for other social assistance programmes outside the MoSD.
a) Child Grants ProgrammeThe Lesotho Child Grants Programme (CGP) was introduced in different Community Councils	across	the	country	from	2009.	The	Government of Lesotho launched the CGP through the technical	and	financial	support	from	UNICEF	and the EU, respectively, and was fully taken over	by	the	Government	in	2013.	The	CGP,	which is unconditional in its nature and constitutes	the	first	cash	transfer,	targeted	at	the	poor	and ultra-poor households of Lesotho, is under the administration of the (MoSD). The objective of the CGP is to improve the living standards of Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC) by reducing malnutrition, improving their health status, and increasing school enrolment among the OVC, through the provisions of a quarterly cash	transfer	to	beneficiary	households.		The	transfer value is linked to the household size. 
b) Supporting People with DisabilitiesRecent estimates on the extent of disability in Lesotho ranges from 2.5 to 3.5 percent of the population.7The Constitution of Lesotho provides that Lesotho adopts policies designed to provide for training facilities, including specialized institutions, public or private; and place People with Disabilities (PWD) in employment and encourage employers to accommodate them.	Lesotho	ratified	the	Convention	on	the	Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN CRPD) in	December,	2008,	with	the	purpose	of	promoting, protecting and ensuring that PWD in Lesotho enjoy their human rights. 
The Government, and other stakeholders, including Lesotho National Federation of Organization of the Disabled (LNFOD), has pursued the strategy of disability mainstreaming in NSDP II,	and	specific	development	programmes	in	all	sectors. Two important frameworks exist: National Disability and Rehabilitation Policy, and the National Disability Mainstreaming Plan (NDMP). The Ministry of Social Development, in consultations with LNFOD, is in the process of	enacting	disability	specific	legislation	that	will	establish a clear legal framework for the promotion and protection of the rights of persons with disabilities. A draft Bill has been completed and validated by all relevant stakeholders and will soon be tabled before the Parliament for enactment into law.
c) Migration 
Lesotho has made migration a major theme of Lesotho’s foreign and public policies, as is reflected	in	Vision	2020	and	the	National	Strategic Development Plan (NSDP). Lesotho has actively participated in the Global Compact on Migration (GCM), Migration Dialogue for Southern Africa (MIDSA), and other inter-governmental policy dialogue forum. The forum called National Consultative Committee on Migration (NCC) has played a key role to address the migration issues in Lesotho. The NCC is consisted of inter-Ministerial, multi-sectoral stakeholders dealing with migration issues in Lesotho including academia and migrants’ associations. NCC is chaired by Ministry of Home Affairs and co-chaired by IOM.
Lesotho	has	achieved	significant	progress	in	the development of migration related policies in recent years. Labour Migration Management Policy was developed by the Ministry of Labour and Employment (MoLE) in March 2018.	Border	and	Migration	Management	and	Assessment	was	conducted	in	May,	2018,	and	based on which, Immigration Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) Manual was produced in November	2018.
The Eighth Amendment to the Constitution to allow	the	dual	citizenship	for	the	first	time	in	Lesotho’s	history	was	passed	in	December	2017.	To effectively involve Basotho living abroad in development of the country, the Government, through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Relations (MoFA) started diaspora engagement in South Africa in preparation of diaspora policy development. 
In	the	next	five	years	and	beyond,	the	Government of Lesotho will continue its efforts and initiatives to make sure “No One is Left Behind” in	accessing	and	benefiting	from	development	initiatives across the country. The Government 

will work with all stakeholders to ensure that policy and enabling environment for SDGs is strengthened and effective. The Government will therefore reach out to various stakeholders and partners and	develop	a	national	SDGs	partnership	and	coordination	strategy	for	effectiveness,	efficiency	and accountability to the people of Lesotho, and the regional and international partners.
4.0 LESOTHO PROGRESS ON SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS
This section presents the progress made by the Kingdom of Lesotho towards the implementation and	achievement	of	SDGs,	guided	by	2019	VNR	Theme	“Empowering	people	and	ensuring	inclusiveness	and	equality”	and	six	goals	under	review:	SDGs	4,	8,	10,	13,	16	and	17.	In	addition	to	these	six goals reviewed in depth in this report, Lesotho highlighted progress made in SDGs 1 and 2 as they relate to the ultimate goal of NSDP II, “to create private sector-led jobs and eradicate extreme poverty”.

4.1.1 Lesotho Progress on Poverty Indicators
The NSDP II puts emphasis on private sector development and gives priority to pursuing people centred development. It re-enforces the Government’s commitment to bring further development to the people of Lesotho by empowering them to participate fully in the development process, thereby providing them dignity, and uplifting their potential to partake in the prosperity that will be generated in the next five years.
(NSDP II, 2018/19-2022/23)

Addressing poverty and reducing inequality in the Kingdom of Lesotho was one of the key challenges by the end of the implementation of	MDGs	in	2015.	With	SDGs,	Lesotho	has	recommitted herself and strives to give all citizens equal opportunities and full access to economic and social opportunities and to live a decent and	dignified	quality	of	life.		It	is	for	this	reason	that the NSDP II emphasizes the necessity to pursue sustainable inclusive growth and creation of decent jobs as the most effective route for poverty reduction.  The Government has introduced strategic measures to empower the people and support the poor and the most vulnerable. The Plan targets increased inclusive growth in four key priority sectors namely, Agriculture, Manufacturing, Tourism and Creative Industries, and Technology and Innovation. 
Targeting, supporting and strengthening macroeconomic resilience for inclusive growth and employment creation is critical. Another area is investing in smart agriculture and increasing rural wealth, promoting inclusive trade and entrepreneurship, in particular supporting Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMES). To achieve these, the GoL will effectively manage government spending and remove any inefficiencies	in	spending.	It	will	ensure	low	and	stable	inflation	rates	which	is	not	only	key	to	achieving the nation’s competitiveness but also important for protection of incomes of the poor; ensuring	sustainable	levels	of	fiscal	deficits	and	maintaining sound external balances. Fiscal policy will be targeted at providing public goods and services that improve national welfare and support the private sector development.
Lesotho tourism sector has potential for creating decent work for young people and accelerating economic growth. GoL, therefore, will increase additional resources and invest in creating enabling environment that will attract local, regional and local investors to the sector. This will include creating relevant legal and policy frameworks, investing in packaging and marketing Lesotho Tourism, quality assurance, and creating incentives to investors.
4.1.2 Lesotho Poverty Indicators
The GoL has successfully reduced absolute poverty	in	the	last	five	years	(Table	4.1.1	below).  Lesotho, through the BoS, produced the	Lesotho	Poverty	Trend	and	Profile	Report	(2019).		The	Report	provides	information	that	is critical for monitoring and evaluation of the country’s development plans, providing key evidence to monitor and evaluate progress towards poverty and inequality targets set in the National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP 
II).
To measure poverty, Lesotho, through the BoS, uses a welfare indicator is measured against a pre-determined threshold (the poverty line) below which a household or individual is deemed poor.  Lesotho uses a consumption-based welfare measure to measure poverty, referred to as the consumption aggregate. The cost-of-basicneeds (CBN) method is used to determine two consumption-based poverty lines for the country – the food or extreme poverty line as well as the upper bound poverty line (referred to in this report as the national poverty line).
Lesotho realised a decline in poverty for both national and extreme poverty between 2002/2003	and	2017/2018.	The	overall	national poverty and extreme poverty headcount ratios declined from 56.6 percent to 49.7 percent and from 34.1 percent to 24.1 percent, respectively	(table	4.1.1).	In	absolute	terms,	484,000	people are estimated to have been living in extreme	poverty	in	2017/2018,	while	997,000	lived under the national poverty line.
Table 4.1.1: Urban-rural and Regional Poverty Dynamics, 2002/2003 – 2017/2018 Source: BoS, 2019. Lesotho Poverty Trend and Profile Report 2000/2003 – 2017/2018.In Lesotho, poverty has a clear regional dimension, with regions that are largely rural having the highest poverty rates. While there was a significant	decline	in	poverty	levels	in	urban	areas, rural areas experienced slower reduction in	poverty.	Between	2002/2003	and	2017/2018,	the number of Basotho living in poverty declined	marginally	from	61.3	percent	to	60.7	percent of the rural population, and from 41.5 percent to 28.5 percent of the urban population (table 4.1.1). However, the extreme poverty headcount ratio declined by 6.9 percentage points	in	rural	areas	(from	37.7	percent	to	30.8	percent) during the same period, compared to 10.9	percentage	points	in	urban	areas	(from	
22.2 percent to 11.2 percent). 
A	profile	of	the	poor	in	Lesotho	suggests	that	Basotho living in female-headed households, Basotho living in households headed by widows or widowers, children, large families, the less educated, and the unemployed are the most prone to being poor. The relationship between poverty	rates	and	age	from	the	2017/18	data	shows a typical U-shaped pattern, with poverty being higher among the youth and the elderly and lower among the working-age population (Figure 4.1.1). Together, children under 16 and the	elderly	(60+)	account	for	approximately	48	percent of the poor. In general, the poverty rate is the highest among the households with three or more children under six years old.

In	2017/2018,	65.5	percent	of	people	were living in households whose head did not have a formal education versus 4.4 percent of those living in a household whose head attained university education. Further, people living in households whose	head	did	not	have	formal	education	constituted	21.2	percent	of	the	poor,	and	16.0	percent	of	the population.

4.1.3 Poverty and Gender
Poverty	is	more	pronounced	among	female-headed	households.	In	2017/2018,	55.2	percent	of	people living in female-headed households were poor compared to 46.3 percent in male-headed households.	However,	most	of	the	poor	(58.5	percent)	are	living	in	male-headed	households	in	2017	(Figure4.1.3). The majority, 62.7 percent, of the Basotho population resided in household headed by males.

National poverty and inequality rates disguise large sub-national variations in poverty, particularly between urban and rural areas. While there	was	a	significant	decline	in	poverty	levels	in urban areas, rural areas experienced slower	reduction	in	poverty.	Between	2002/2003	and	2017/2018,	the	number	of	Basotho	living	in poverty declined marginally from 61.3 percent	to	60.7	percent	of	the	rural	population,	and	from 41.5 percent to 28.5 percent of the urban population (Table 4.1.2 below). However, the extreme poverty headcount ratio declined by 6.9 percentage points in rural areas (from 37.7 percent	to	30.8	percent)	during	the	same	period,	compared	to	10.9	percentage	points	in	urban areas (from 22.2 percent to 11.2 percent). There	were	also	significant	differences	in	poverty levels and poverty trends between ecological zones: the Mountains and Senqu River Valley	were	the	poorest	in	2017/2018	while	the	Maseru Urban was the least poor. Moreover, these two poorest regions experienced an increase in the poverty rate while there was a reduction in Maseru Urban, other urban regions as well as in Rural Lowlands and the Foothills. A	profile	of	the	poor	indicates	that	the	subpopulation groups that exhibit the highest poverty levels are people living in female-headed households, households in which the head is a widow or widower, large families, household with relatively large dependency ratios, and children.	In	addition,	the	profile	shows	that	poverty is highest among households with limited access to basic services including health facilities (SDG 3), education and training services (SDG 4), energy (SDG 7), water and sanitation facilities (SDGs 6).
4.1.4 Overall Inequalities Statistics: The 
Gini Index
A	significant	change	in	the	level	of	inequality	was	recorded	between	2002/2003	and	2017/2018.	Using	the	Gini	Index	as	a	measure	of	inequality,	the	findings	indicate	that	the	consumption per adult equivalent Gini Index was 51.9	in	2002/2003	and	fell	by	6.3	Gini	points	to	44.6	in	2017/2018.	In	urban	areas,	the	Gini	Index	fell	from	51.7	in	2002/2003	to	41.5	in	2017/2018.	The	corresponding	change	in	rural	areas	was	from	50.5	to	41.7.	The	drop	in	the	Gini Index is partly explained by changes in the survey instrument which collected data on actual	consumption	in	2017/2018	compared	to	consumption	expenditure	in	2002/2003.

The	Gini	Index	in	rural	areas	was	41.7	in	2017/18,	while	the	Gini	Index	in	urban	areas	was	4.1.4	(Figure 4.1.4 below). Thus, inequality is almost the same in urban and rural areas, and lower than the national level. The consumption per adult equivalent Gini Index, a measure of inequality, declined	nationally	as	well	as	in	urban	and	rural	areas	between	2002/2003	and	2017/2018.	The	Gini	Index declined from 51.9 to 44.6. 12In urban areas, the Gini Index fell from 51.7 to 41.5 and from 50.5	to	41.7	in	rural	areas.

4.1.58 Child and Adolescent Poverty
Lesotho has a relatively young population with nearly a half of the inhabitants under the age of 18.9 A study of child and adolescent poverty in Lesotho, using UNICEF Multiple Overlapping Deprivation Analysis (MODA) methodology in	2018	indicates	that	about	65.4	per	cent	of	all	children	and	adolescent	(aged	0-17	years)	are multi-dimensionally poor, that is they are simultaneously deprived of three or more dimensions of well-being. 10Box 4.1.1 gives the summary	of	the	findings	of	child	poverty	by	dimension of deprivation. The Basotho children are at the forefront of vulnerability and experience several deprivations at a time. 
Deprivation is more than lack of income and resources to sustain livelihood (SDG 8). It comprises malnutrition; limited access to education, health and other basic facilities and services (SDGs 3, 4, 5, 6, 7); discrimination and	violence	and	lack	of	protection	(5,	10,	16).	15Alleviation of child poverty is one area of development, which is central in SDGs, as articulated in SDG 1. Target 1.2 aims at reducing at least by half, the proportion of children, men, and women living in poverty in all its dimension according	to	national	definition	by	2030.
Box 4.1.1: Child Poverty by Dimension of Well-being
1. Across age groups, between 84-88 percent of children are deprived with respect to housing (SDG 1, SDG 11), 
2. HIV and AIDs affect 74 percent of children aged	0-23	months,	and	63	percent	of	children	aged	24	–	59	months	(SDG	3,	10).
3. Nutrition intake is not adequate for 77 percent	of	children	aged	0-23	months	(SDGs	1,	2). 4. Child protection rate has higher deprivation	for	children	aged	0-23	months	and	24-59	months (79 And 72 percent respectively) compared to children aged 5-12 years and 13-17 years (36 and 42 percent respectively) (SDG 16).
5. Education is a vulnerability for 17 per of primary school children and 67 percent of secondary school children (SDG 4). 6.	Water	deprivation	rate	range	between	29	–	32 percent among children of four age group (SDG 6).
8.	Between	7	and	10	percent	of	all	children	are	deprived with respect to information (SDG 16). MoDP	BoS/UNICEF	Lesotho
15Ibid.7. Sanitation deprivation is 64 percent for children	aged	0-23	months,		and	between	48	and	54 percent for children aged 2-17 years.(SDG 6.
Box 4.1.2 
Profiling Multidimensional Child-Poverty in Lesotho
1. 65.4 percent of all children (aged 0-17 years) are multidimensionally poor.
2. Multidimensional child poverty is significantly higher in rural area compared to urban areas (72 and 43 percent respectively).
3. At regional level, Maseru has the lowest proportion of multidimensional poor children (56 percent), while Mokhotlong and Thaba-Tseka have the highest multidimensional poverty rates among children (85 and 84 percent respectively).
4. The proportion of multidimensional poor children is higher in mountain locations compared to lowlands (82 and 52.7 percent respectively).
5. Difference in child deprivation based on gender are relatively small for younger children. For older children, the gender disparities are more visible, particularly with respect to education, which affects 72 percent of boys aged 13-17 compared to 50 percent of girls in the same age group.
6. Orphan-hood is a condition that enhances multidimensional child poverty.
7. Multidimensional poverty rates are higher for girls experiencing early pregnancies compared to girls who have not been pregnant (92 and 69 percent respectively).
The GoL is committed to ensuring that child poverty is addressed comprehensively and in a sustained	manner	in	the	next	five	years	and	beyond. Apart from stimulating economic growth and attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), the Government is investing heavily in the social sectors to promote inclusive and quality education and health, accessible to all Basotho children and adolescent. There are also initiatives	/programmes	to	address	child	protection	with an objective of creating a society in Lesotho where every child, adolescent and young person is safe, protected and thriving. 
4.2 GOAL 2: END HUNGER, ACHIEVE FOOD SECURITY AND IMPROVED NUTRITION 
AND PROMOTE SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE                      
4.2.1 Lesotho Hunger Indicators Lesotho is committed to addressing hunger and undernutrition. This has been demonstrated by several policy frameworks and programmes that are in place, most importantly National Vision	2020	that	seeks	to	ensure	a	healthy	and	well-developed human resource base. The Food	and	Nutrition	Security	Policy	(2017),	the	proposed Food and Nutrition Strategy and the Zero	Strategic	Review	Report	(2018)	all	provide a framework to address the multi-dimensional causes and consequences of malnutrition. All these high-level initiatives and many others symbolize GoL’s efforts to achieve the WHO	Targets	2025,	the	African	Union	Agenda	2063	Goals	as	well	as	the	Sustainable	Development Goal (SDG) target 2.2 - “ to end all forms	of	malnutrition	by	2030”.	
Food and nutrition insecurity in Lesotho is related to poor performance and low productivity in the agricultural sector. The population at risk of food insecurity in Lesotho varies each year with	a	projection	of	640,000	people	to	be	food	insecure	during	the	period	of	July	2019	to	June	2020.	This	is	due	to	a	combination	of	droughts,	lack	of	financial	resources	(due	to	rising	poverty) to purchase inputs to increase productivity, land degradation, weak management of the sector, limited extension service delivery to farmers contributing to sub-optimal application of modern agricultural methods, pest and disease outbreaks (such as army-worm infestations), limited grazing land and stock theft. In the	2017/18	consumption	year	224,664	people in the rural areas and about 82,278 people within urban settlements have been estimated to be food insecure. Lesotho currently relies on imports	from	South	Africa	to	meet	70	percent	of	its food security needs.

Although	chronic	and	acute	malnutrition	has	declined	since	2004	(Figure	4.2.2),	the	nutrition	situation	in	Lesotho	is	characterised	by	high	stunting	rates	in	children	under	the	age	of	five	years,	wide-spread	micro-nutrient	deficiencies	in	children,	adolescents	and	adults,	overweight	and	obesity	in some segments of the population, and the growing incidence of diet related non-communicable diseases (NCDs) which are costing lives and imposing a burden on the health system.

Note: The 2004 data was converted using the WHO Conversion tooI on 2006 growth standards

Stunting: At least one in three children under the	age	of	five	years	is	stunted	(33.2	percent	according the Lesotho Demographic Health Survey	of	2014).	Whilst	both	chronic	and	acute	malnutrition in this age group of children has decreased	since	2004,	stunting	remains	high	and above the WHO public health threshold of 29 percent for moderate prevalence. Chronic malnutrition is high across all districts, especially	in	Butha-Buthe	(40.3	percent),	and	the	mountain districts of Mokhotlong (47.7 percent) and	Thaba-Tseka	(40	percent).	The	population	density varies by districts with the largest number of children chronically malnourished in the higher population districts of Maseru, Leribe and Mohale’s Hoek. Two of the districts with the highest stunting rates (Mokhotlong and in Thaba-Tseka) have extreme concentrations of poverty. The majority of the population in these districts is in the lowest wealth quintile (53 and 55

percent, respectively). About 45 percent of the adult population in Lesotho is stunted (COHA Lesotho,	2016).		The	consequences	of	stunting	on other SDGs is key to note. These include negative effects on cognitive functions required for successful educational outcomes, and poor maternal health outcomes. 
Wasting: The prevalence of wasting remains low	across	all	districts,	(under	five	percent).	The districts with the largest number of children under	five	with	acute	malnutrition	are	Maseru,	Leribe and Berea. 
Micro-nutrient deficiencies: According to the LDHS,	2014	Report,	half	of	all	children	have	some form of anaemia whilst more than one in four women (27.3 percent) of age 15-49 years have anaemia. The prevalence of anaemia in women and children has remained a critical public	health	issue	since	2004	and	has	increased	in	recent	years.	Vitamin	A	deficiency	among	pre-school	aged	children	was	identified	as	a	severe	public	health	problem	in	2005,	with	32.7percent of these children being affected. However, updated data is missing. The same applies	to	iodine	deficiency	in	all	school-aged	children	as	one-fifth	were	deficient	in	2002	but	more recent statistics are not available. 
Lesotho is a mountainous country, with about two-thirds of the land characterized as not arable. But, agriculture is the backbone of the rural economy with about 58 percent of the population earning their living from it. 16However, the sector´s contribution to GDP has been declining, largely due to adverse climatic conditions, thereby reaching a low of 6.9 percent in	2016.	This	compares	with	16	percent	in	the	early	1980s.	The	sector	employs	9	percent	of	the urban population, and 54 percent of their rural counterparts. and supports livelihoods of over	80	percent	of	the	rural	population.	17While it is the main livelihood source for a majority of the rural population, the ability of Lesotho to produce its own food has declined in recent decades. 18This was largely the result of an El Nino drought, soil infertility and land degradation. 19Together, these factors exacerbated vulnerability to recurrent shocks, and entrench food insecurity and undernutrition. The result has been a sharp decline in food production and a failure to plant new crops by a large proportion of farmers.  In addition to the formally trained	and	employed	extension	officers,	the	Government of Lesotho uses the lead farmer extension model where the lead farmers are drawn from the communities to further train and mentor others. Negative effects induced by the El	Niño	phenomenon	left	640,000	people	(58	percent children) food insecure.20
4.2.2 Lesotho Action Programmes
Eradicating hunger and malnutrition are longstanding priorities in Lesotho because they are related to poverty (SDG 1), access to social services like education (SDG 4) and health (SDG	3),	gender-based/sex-based	violence	
(SDG	3,	10)	and	limited	participation	in	community/country´s	development	(SDGs	13,	16).	Therefore, eradicating hunger and reducing malnutrition through comprehensive and sustained multi-sectoral approach is imperative for the country. The Government is also aware of the necessity to support to the poor and vulnerable groups to ensure access to food that is safe,	nutritious	and	sufficient.
i. The Government has created the Food and Nutrition	Coordinating	Office’s	(FNCO)	under	the	Prime	Minister´s	Office	to	provide	leadership and coordinate response to hunger and nutrition in Lesotho. It has also launched a programme called “Renewed Efforts Against Child Hunger	and	Undernutrition”	–	REACH-	to	galvanize efforts, implementation, monitoring and reporting on hunger and nutrition programmes and initiates.
ii. Lesotho,	with	the	UN	support,	finalised	the	Lesotho Food and Nutrition Policy, and the Cost of Hunger in Africa Study (Lesotho Chapter), which together with the Scaling Up Nutrition	Movement	(SUN)	were	launched	in	2016,	by His Majesty King Letsie III who is also AU Nutrition Champion and FAO Special Ambassador for Nutrition.
iii. Capacity assessment was commissioned in August	2017,	through	REACH	support	with	the	aim of focusing primarily on the Food and Nutrition	Coordinating	Office’s	(FNCO)	capacity	to	leverage multi-sectoral and multi-stakeholder nutrition coordination process while ensuring effective engagement of all key actors. The capacity assessment was also undertaken to identify gaps in capacity for the line ministries and stakeholders to effectively engage in SUN process at all levels. This was one of the recommendations of the nutrition situation analysis	conducted	in	2015.	
iv. Lesotho developed National Food and Nutrition Strategy and Costed Action Plan (FNSAP) for	Lesotho	for	the	period	2019-2023,	with	a	vision: “A well-nourished, healthy and productive nation”.	This	document	articulates	and	defines	the national medium-term strategy for food and nutrition security together with a costed action plan, both of which shall guide the design and implementation of food and nutrition security programmes, projects and related actions by all stakeholders. It presents evidence-based high-return investments that have been identified	and	prioritised	through	a	multi-sectoral	consultation approach. The strategies are aligned with national development priorities as articulated in the NSDP II as well as the regional and international policies and protocols on food and nutrition security. 
4.2.3 Poverty and Hunger - Next Steps Going Forward 
• Reducing poverty levels and inequalities (nationally and in the districts) and reducing inequalities across the country, by rolling out and sustaining	the	gains	of	the	last	five	years	and	using evidence-based and result-based management.
• Enhancing food security, by improving productivity through research and development, use of technology, optimizing agriculture land use, encouraging and supporting smart and precision	agriculture/farming.
• Adequate funding, effective implementation and monitoring the economic, social and environmental programmes articulated in the NSDP II.
• Mobilizing	financial	and	human	resources	for	NSDP II though national, regional and international partnerships.
• Balancing	social	protection/humanitarian	assistance	with	development	agenda	–	building	community and households resilience.
• Strengthening national coordination and engagement structures for effective prioritization and monitoring of, and reporting on SDGs.
• Revitalizing FNCO’s overall coordination architecture by reviewing and reforming the governance structures for multi-sectoral coordination. 
• Effective implementation and monitoring of “Renewed Efforts Against Child Hunger and Undernutrition”	–	REACH-	initiatives.
• Strengthening of health and nutrition programmes for attainment of good health.

4.3 GOAL 4: ENSURE INCLUSIVE AND EQUITABLE QUALITY 
EDUCATION AND PROMOTE LIFELONG LEARNING OPPOR-
TUNITIES FOR ALL

4.3.1 Lesotho Progress on Education Indicators
“As the youth, we acknowledge and appreciate the efforts made to ensure that every child has access to education, efforts like the Free Primary Education for All, the school feeding scheme, introduction of the special education program in Lesotho College of Education and NUL. However, we can’t overlook the fact that our education system is not accessible and equitable to every child. We still have only two church-owned schools for visually impaired (VI) learners and one high school for those with speech and hearing impairments countrywide. The visually impaired learners have limited access to books and other learning materials, and we say, because SDG 4 reference disability, we call for implementation of strategies that are disability sensitive and further recommend placement of qualified special education teachers, and the provision of accessible learning materials at schools in all the 10 districts. This will enable learners with disabilities to have equal access to quality and equitable education without having to migrate to Maseru like the non-disabled. Education is a right for all, and not just for the privileged. We strongly call for a rights-based approach to inclusive, quality and equitable education to ensure that every child including those in remote and hard to reach areas completes a full cycle of quality education without hustle.  While working on that, we need to be engaged on how best our educational needs can be met. 
“Nothing for Us, Without Us”
(Youth Voices from Mafeteng District, May 2019)

Lesotho has a 3-7-3-2 formal education structure. There are three years of Pre-primary Education (Childhood education), which has an official	entry	age	of	three;	Primary	Education	(grades	1-7),	with	an	official	entry	age	of	six	and a duration of seven grades. Secondary Education is divided into two cycles: Lower secondary and Upper secondary. Lower secondary	(Junior	Secondary)	consists	of	grades	8-10	and	culminates	into	the	Junior	Certificate	(JC),	and Upper Secondary consists of grades 11-12 and culminates into the Lesotho General Certificate	of	Secondary	Education	(LGCSE)	-	O	level. Then Tertiary Education, which includes Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET), and University Education.
Lesotho recognizes that inclusive and quality education and training, together with health (SDG 3) is part of human capital development and critical enabler for achieving sustainable development in the country. Without human capital	development,	achieving	SDGs	by	2030	will be a tall order in Lesotho. The Government of Lesotho, therefore, envisages the provision of an equitable basic education to all the people as a key developmental goal. 
Basic education is seen as an essential part of social and economic development. It is regarded by the Government as a fundamental human right. It is also seen as an essential pre-condition for mid-level employment and secondary and post- secondary education and training. The GoL counts on development of partnerships with religious organisations, the private sector, NGOs, communities, and development partners to increase educational opportunities to all Basotho children.
Figure 4.3.1 Expenditure in the Education Sector as a Pecentage of GDP and National 
High	spending	in	the	education	sector	reflects	the Government’s priority of providing free primary education. Figure 4.3.1 indicates public	spending	in	education	between	2014/15	–	2018/19	financial	years.	Indeed,	primary	education received the largest share of spending in accordance with the country’s provision of free primary education.21 By contrast, spending on Early Childhood Care and Development (ECCD) and Secondary education is very low.

The GoL is committed to providing all children in Lesotho with free, inclusive and quality primary education. Therefore, the Government has come up with legal and policy frameworks that provide enabling environment for effective and inclusive teaching and learning, leading to effective learning outcomes. Each subsector of education namely pre-primary, primary, secondary, TVET and tertiary as well as non-formal education are all targeted by investment in order to improve access, quality, inclusiveness, teaching-learning materials and learning outcomes. 
The GoL, through the Ministry of Education, has developed the Education Sector Plan 2016-2026	and	the	Action	Plan	2017-2020.	The education sector objectives are summarized in Box 4.3.1
The current Education Sector Strategic Plan (ESSP) highlights a concern related to quality and matching the production of graduates with labour market demands. During the recent Joint	Education	Sector	review	in	2018,	the	Ministry of Education and Training announced key priority interventions for the next three years that included: introduction of a multi-tier model;	introduction	of	AS-level	qualification	and	A-Levels	qualification	in	secondary	schools;	evaluation of phasing out primary school level	qualifications;	development	of	TVET	funding model; and implementation of centralised and automated application system to regulate entry and funding of tertiary students. Building capacity of teachers and developing a comprehensive teacher policy is also priority. 
4.3.2 Lesotho Action: Policy Frameworks 

Box 4.3.1: Education Sector Objectives 1. To improve access, efficiency and equity of education and training at all levels. 
2. To improve the quality of education and training. 
3. To ensure that curricula and materials are relevant to the needs of Lesotho, are consonant with the appropriate standards and gender responsive. 
4. To ensure that both vocational-technical and non-formal education programs respond to the needs of industry and the communities in general. 
5. To develop and implement a common system of regular collection and reporting of information on the current status and future demand and supply, and on priority educational areas in the country. 6 .To progressively achieve the equivalence, harmonization and standardization of the education and training systems nationally, regionally and internationally. 
7. To effectively participate in regional and international educational sector development initiatives. 
8. To promote gender equality and ensure empowerment disadvantaged groups. 
9. Address the challenges posed by HIV and AIDS in education and training. 

and programmes in Sub-Sectors of Education
4.3.2.1 Pre-primary Level of Education One of the key objectives of the Ministry of Education and Training (MoET) is to ensure that Pre-primary education and development services are made universal, of high quality, comprehensive and respond to all the local needs, language and cultures across the country. Although Early Childhood Care and Development (ECCD) education is generally a private sector affair (Figure 4.3.2), the Government of Lesotho places emphasis on the importance of a Mosotho child attending at least reception class before enrolling into primary education, although it is not compulsory. The emphasis is due	to	known	benefits	of	ECCD	education	on	learning outcomes globally22.

The GoL through the MoET adopted the National Policy for Integrated Early Childhood Care and Development (NPIECCD) in 2013, which currently guides the provision of early childhood care and development (ECCD). The Policy presents the national initiative for a holistic child and family development. It is underpinned by respect for and involvement of parents, grandparents, adoptive parents and legal guardians in facilitating access and participation in high-quality and cost effective integrated ECCD education in their communities. The Policy promotes advocacy for community’s awareness and the enabling of access to ensure	that	every	child	between	three	and	five	years is enrolled in ECCD that stimulates his or her language, cognitive, physical, social and emotional development, including the ability to regulate their behaviour23.  MoET currently allocates	only	0.36	percent	(this	is	an	increase	from	0.23	percent	in	2015)	of	its	annual	budget	to ECCD.
The MoET, with the support of the World Bank (under the Early Learning Partnership Initiative) and the Global Partnership for Education (GPE), together with UNICEF and GIZ, conducted the Early Childhood Care and Development	National	Study	in	2018.		The	overall	

objective for the Study was to produce data on child development and the quality of learning environments.	Specifically,	the	study	focused	on gaining a better understanding of: 1) key characteristics of preschools, teachers, and enrolled families; 2) how children are developing and what factors are associated with child development; 3) the quality of preschools and what factors are associated with higher levels of quality; and 4) the costs associated with improving child outcomes. Results from the Study are informing the development of monitoring tools that can be integrated into the education management information system and used by partners to provide ongoing information related to early childhood education.
According	to	the	2016	Lesotho	Population	Census,	there	were	43,	935	five-year	olds	in	the	entire	population.	Only	about	40	percent	(13,181)	of	the	five-year	olds	were	reported	to	be enrolled in pre-schools, and 1.5 percent had left	school	for	unspecified	reasons25. Pre-primary education enrolment varies by districts, with the poorest regions, those in the mountain in particular, having less learning centres and thus enrolment (Figure 4.3.3 and Table 4.3.1 below)

The enrolment in reception classes show that government must build new reception classes if it is to	achieve	universal	ECCD	education	and	eliminate	the	gap	between	the	enrolled	five	years	old	and	those not enrolled (Table 4.3.1.above).  Figure 4.3.4 shows the ECCD and GPI for both male and female	from	2015	to	2017.	Among	children	aged	three	to	five	in	2016,	49.9	percent	of	them	were	males	while	50.1	percent	were	females,	showing	that	girls	are	slightly	advantaged	at	this	level.

Available data indicates that children living with disabilities enrolled in ECCD schools were less than	two	percent	between	2015	and	2017	nationwide, although this data is not comprehensive enough. 
The GoL recognizes that ECCD in Lesotho requires additional investment to improve and increase infrastructure and quality of care and education offered at this level.  The Government is therefore investing and call for support in promoting the following:
Expanding IECCD complimentary approaches countrywide:  The MoET is taking measures to promote extension of parental education on integrated ECCD, focusing on home-based approaches to child care and development. This includes the provision of learning and teaching materials as well as equipment for promoting the home-based approach. The input of communities, the private sector and development cooperation	partners	shall	be	specifically	enlisted for these supplementary actions. 
Streamlining the Child Development Centres registration process: There are efforts to expand and promote integrated ECCD and achieve	a	100	percent	access	for	age	group	of	three	to	six	by	2030.		The	regulatory	and	legislative regime under which integrated ECCD activities are undertaken shall be streamlined. As part of this, the Ministry shall ensure that the requirement to register child care centres are gazetted and work towards the registration of unregistered centres. 
Attaching Reception Classes to every GOL/ Community primary school:  In order to expand access, especially to the poorer mountain regions, the Government is piloting the attachment of reception classes to every primary school.	The	target	is	that	by	2030	reception	classes shall be attached to existing primary schools. 
Providing subsidy to disadvantaged children: Mindful of the high poverty prevalence levels, the Government is providing subsidies to children from poor families. The subsidy mainly targets children that are orphaned, disabled and neglected. 
Integration of children with special needs into ECCD: The Government is undertaking a study to establish the magnitude of the challenge of addressing children with special disabilities and design the best strategies on how to integrate them into the ECCD programmes. 
They include children that are visually impaired, with hearing impairment, physically disabled, OVCs, and the neglected children including children in the street. 
Key Achievements
• Development of the National Policy for Integrated Early Childhood Care and Development 
(NPIECCD) 
• Establishment	of	240	reception	classes	attached to primary schools • Establishment of ECCD Unit in the MOET • Lesotho College of Education (LCE) has started in-service training of ECCD teachers and is developing an Early Childhood Education (ECE) Diploma. These efforts are complemented by training provided by the Inspectorate Department of the MoET.
Next Step Going Forward
• Addressing the issue of ownership and its negative impact on access and quality of pre-primary education.
• Funding Pre-primary education: The current allocation	of	only	0.3	percent	of	the	total	education budget to ECCD is inadequate and needs to be reviewed. 
• Expanding access rate to ECCD to all school-age children across the country. 
• Supporting, expanding and sustaining school feeding programme to pre-primary education is one of the critical strategies that will increase school participation. 
• Strengthening quality assurance in pre-primary programmes, quality of teachers, facilities and increasing access nationally, particularly for the poorest and those in rural areas.
• Bridging gender gaps in pre-primary education: male enrolment in pre-primary education is lagging behind. However, this varies from district to district. 
4.3.2.2 Lesotho Primary Education Level
Figure 4.3.5 Lesotho School Net Enrolment Rate: MICS/BOS data 2018
The GoL introduced Free Primary Education (FPE)	in	2000	which	resulted	in	a	surge	in	enrolment. Over the years, there has been a growth in both the Net Enrolment Rate (NER) and the Gross Enrolment Rate (GER). Lesotho is almost achieving universal primary education (UPE), with gender parity.  Figure 4.3.5 indicates the school net enrolment by sub-sectors of education. 

The Government developed several laws and policies to demonstrate its commitment to the Education for All agreement. The legal and policy framework governing primary education is as follows:
1.Curriculum and Assessment Policy (CAP) is worth noting for its change from examination-oriented focus to competency-based teaching and learning. It also recognised language diversity as it added Sign Language as part of the language policy along with Sesotho and English Languages11.  
2.	The	Education	Act	of	2010,	which	declares	primary education as Free and Compulsory1213. 3.	Child	Protection	and	Welfare	Act	of	2011,	Section 11 which declares education as a right and outlaws any form of discrimination or barrier to facilitate children’s access to education . 4. The National School Feeding Policy which commits the Government to provide at least two meals on each school day in all public primary schools29.
5. The Education Sector HIV and AIDS Policy commits MoET to provide psychosocial support to the education workforce including teachers and	to	learners	infected	and	affected	by	HIV/ AIDS14.
6. Inclusive Education Policy which mandates teachers to use learners’ individual needs and hence its alignment with CAP demands integration of assessment with teaching and learning.15
7. Education Language Policy will enable inclusion of children from the language minority groups, including Sign Language16.
 
Since the introduction of free primary education	in	the	year	2000,	the	number	of	teachers	has	increased	by	50	percent,	contributing	to	lower student-teacher ratio, notwithstanding the great geographical disparities. With almost 15,900	teachers,	Lesotho	has	achieved	a	student-teacher	ratio	of	30	for	the	country	as	a	whole, with a ratio of 33 in primary schools and 25 in secondary schools. 
Only 14 percent of teachers in primary education	are	unqualified	with	a	pupil	teacher	ratio	of	33	for	all	teachers	and	34	for	qualified	teachers. Botha-Bothe and Leribe enjoy the lowest	percentage	of	unqualified	teachers	at	8	and 9 percent respectively while Quthing and Thaba-Tseka have the highest percentage of unqualified	teachers	at	22	and	20	percent	respectively. The MoET has committed itself to improving the quality of primary education through	upgrading	teacher	qualifications	to	at	least diploma level.  Most teachers in Lesotho are	qualified	but	learning	outcomes	are	still	not	good. This means that more investment needs to be made in this area including on-going coaching/mentoring	for	teachers	and	regular	assessment of learning as well as putting improvement plans in place. 
Next Step Going Forward
• Improving quality of teaching and learning outcomes, particularly in relation to level of spending.
• Improving	efficiency	in	financial	management.	About 92 percent of the education budget in 2018/19	was	allocated	to	recurrent	items,	primarily	salaries.	This	reflects	a	spending	imbalance between other recurrent expenditure items and capital expenditure and makes it difficult	to	invest	in	other	inputs	to	increase	the	quality of education. 
• Addressing regional and wealth quintile disparities in enrolment, learning and completion.
• Effectively implementing inclusive education policy to increase access and quality for learners with disabilities. 
4.3.2.3 Lesotho Secondary Education Level In Lesotho, secondary education is divided into two levels, namely lower and upper secondary. The lower secondary education level (Form A to C) has a national terminal examination called	the	Junior	Certificate	(JC).	Students	who	pass JC enrol in upper secondary (Form D to E). Students who enrol at this level sit for Lesotho	General	Certificate	in	Secondary	Education	(LGCSE) at the end of the two years to pave way for enrolling into tertiary education. 
In	the	2017/18	fiscal	year	secondary	education	received 28 percent of the annual education budget, which increased to 32 percent in the 2018/19	budget	(4	percent	increase)33. However, the recurrent budget takes a huge bulk of the allocated budget as it increased from 89.9 percent	in	2014/15	to	91.8	percent	in	2018/19	with	the	capital	budget	declining	from	10.1	percent	to 8.1 percent for the same period. At the same time grants from donors, which made up 88 percent	of	the	development	budget	in	2014/15,	have	declined	to	only	38	percent	2018/19	with	the Government turning to loans that have increased	from	almost	nothing	in	2015/16	to	68	and	53	percent	in	2017/18	in	2018/19	respec-
tively.34
One of challenges to secondary education (particularly in rural areas) is lack of access to secondary schools. There is a need to build more or expand primary school to include lower secondary. This can only be done with an increase in capital budget. 
In Lesotho, the transition rate from primary to secondary	increased	from	76.9	percent	in	2015	to	77.3	percent	in	2016.	The	GPI	associated	with both the GER and NER show that educational enrolment in secondary education is in favour of females. However, the most important indicator about both the GPIs is that, males turn to enrol into secondary education a bit older than	the	school	official	age	of	secondary	level.

Table 4.3.3 below shows that there were more students in secondary education from lowlands for the period under review, with Maseru having the highest proportions of secondary enrolment. Lower	enrolments	were	observed	in	Mokhotlong,	Thaba-Tseka	and	Qacha’s	Nek.	Data	from	the	2016	Census Report show a 7.5 percent participation difference for females across ecological zones as it ranges from 81.3 percent for females in the foothills to 88.8 percent in the lowlands. The NER for females in the mountainous zone is 2.5.

Secondary school participation in Lesotho has faced challenges and consequently declined as shown in Figures 4.3.6 and 4.3.7 below.

The	Lesotho	2016	Census	Report	indicates	that	some	of	the	factors	that	adversely	affect	completion	rate at Secondary education include social challenges such as teenage pregnancy at 19 percent and child marriage at 24 percent. Child labour, herding animals and initiation schools are factors that hinder boys’ participation in secondary education.
Evidence also shows that learners experience violence in schools, including sexual violence. These vulnerabilities are most prevalent among adolescents in rural areas and those with poor family backgrounds.

Although Lesotho has policies on Inclusive Education and Education Language as enablers, there has	been	fluctuation	in	the	number	of	students	living	with	disabilities	in	primary	education	sub-sector. The NER of learners with disabilities is lower than that of their non-disabled counterparts and so is the NER for children from minority groups, especially Xhosa language speakers. There were 8	235	enrolled	in	2015	in	which	60.1	percent	were	females	and	39.1	percent	were	males,	while	7	335	in	2016	of	which	59.9	percent	were	females	and	40.1	percent	males.	In	2017,	there	were	8	652	with	59.2	percent	females	and	40.8	percent	males.
Box 4.3.2: Innovation for Access to Education by Vulnerable Groups
Despite secondary education not being free, the Government of Lesotho has made a major contribution towards funding vulnerable learners including orphans. There are three innovative interventions that the GoL took to make equitable access to education easier. First, it supports vulnerable children by awarding them bursaries to enable them to participate in secondary education “where the demand for fees, books and other supplies is much higher than that of primary schools”35. Second, along with bursaries for the vulnerable, the GoL introduced a book rental scheme policy to reduce heavy burden of expensive books for parents. Lastly, the Government undertook a fees rationalisation in all public secondary schools in the country to ensure that all children have access to secondary education.

Next Steps Going Forward
•Effective implementation of education priorities	in	the	NSDP	II	and	ESSP	2016-2026	with	clear targets.
•Addressing push factors such as teenage pregnancy, child marriage and violence that limit progression and subsequently affect availability of skilled, educated and health productive workforce. 
• Supporting and increasing male participation in secondary education particularly those in poor districts. 
•Supporting and increasing secondary school attendance in rural areas particularly in foothills and mountains where attendance is 41 percent and 37 percent respectively.
•Revamping secondary education through revision of CAP in view of skills sets that address the fourth industrial revolution and properly aligned with programmes at TVET and tertiary levels that are equally relevant.
•Allocating more resources for effective management of secondary education. More resources are needed to increase access at the secondary level particularly for the most disadvantaged including students with disabilities. •Strengthen management and monitoring of bursary scheme for vulnerable learners to increase their participation at secondary education level.
4.3.2.4 Lesotho Tertiary Education Level The Tertiary education sub-system in Lesotho comprises Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) and Higher Education Institutions (HEIs), with non-formal education sub-sector cutting across all sectors. The GoL is committed to and places emphasis on expanding TVET and university education opportunities in order to produce more learned and skilled labour force.  
 TVET sub-Sector: The Government notes concerns relating to capacity challenges of TVET institutions in terms of availability of space, suitability of curriculum provided and quality of assessment mechanism17. In order to ensure that every Mosotho has access to affordable and quality technical and vocational education, the Government adopted the TVET Policy	in	May	2019.	The	policy	environment	includes facilitation of increased access and enrolments in TVET by introducing the modularised	programmes	that	are	flexible	with	multiple	entry and exit points and introduction of TVET evening classes. Further, the formation of the Lesotho Skills Authority (LSA) adds a balancing factor to managing TVET institutions. The LSA is also mandated to register and accredit TVET institutions. 
TVET	is	largely	financed	by	the	Government	and supplemented by student fees set at minimum	levels.	In	2015/16	financial	year	TVET	schools received 1.4 percent of the educational	sector’s	budget.	In	the	financial	year	2016/17	the allocation remained the same but increased to	1.8	percent	in	2016/17	and	decreased	to	1.7	percent	in	2018/19.	
Higher Education Sub-Sector: The legal framework for Higher Education sub-sector is provided	by	Higher	Education	Act	of	2004.	This	Act was enacted to strengthen the regulation of Higher Education (HE) in Lesotho through the establishment of Council on Higher Education (CHE). The CHE is a statutory body established in	2010	by	Lesotho	to	focus	on	developing	and	implementing a system of quality assurance for higher education, which includes ‘quality promotion, quality assurance and to advise the Minister	of	Education	and	Training’.	In	2013,	the	government promulgated Higher Education Policy, which mandates HEIs to promote access for students and ensure that Lesotho’s higher education system produces graduates with knowledge, skills and values to contribute to the nation’s development, as well as the capacity to respond to challenges and exploit opportunities that will arise in the future .18
Public HEIs in Lesotho receive funding from the GoL. They received 5.4 percent of the budget allocated	for	education	in	2017/18	and	the	allocation	was	increased	to	11.5	percent	in	2018/19	fiscal	year38.Although the budget for HEIs seems relatively small, GoL becomes the highest spender on tertiary education due to the loan bursary scheme. Lesotho has one public university and two private universities, which have proven to lack capacity to provide enrolment for all eligible candidates with Gross Enrolment Rate	(GER)	of	10.1	percent	in	2015/16.	
Figure 4.3.9: Gross Enrolment Ratios in HEIs 2012/13-2015/16
Source: Higher Education Statistical Bulletin , 2012/13 &2015/16
Next Steps Going Forward
• Considering the loan (bursary) low repayment rate (4 percent), it is necessary to develop strategies of	recovery	so	that	the	most	needy	students	could	benefit.	
• There is a need to improve quality and availability of TVET and non-formal education if Lesotho is to increase the number of youth and adults who have relevant skills, for employment, decent jobs and entrepreneurship.
• There is need for a labour market analysis to ensure courses offered meet the needs of employers.
• The MoET is currently considering a three-stream system at secondary schools, which would Promoting access to higher education is one of the policy goals of the sector.  However, this has proved to be a big challenge, which needs to be addressed to ensure access to higher education by those eligible. This is evidenced by declining enrolments in almost all HEIs. According to Higher Education Statistical Bulletin, enrolments in registered higher institutions in 2015/16	decreased	to	21,586	students	compared	to	21,664	in	2014/15	(a	decrease	of	0.4	percent)19 (Figure 4.3.9). There were more females’	learners	with	60.5	percent	compared	with their male counter parts who accounted for 39.5 percent.

include vocational and technical training parallel to the traditional academic route. However, building and expanding existing TVET schools could be a more viable option.
4.3.2.5 Non-Formal Education
The Government of Lesotho has embraced Non-Formal Education (NFE) as one of the most important vehicles to promote national development. The Ministry of Education has therefore, through consultation and participatory approach developed and launched a Non-Formal	Education	(NFE)	Policy	in	2018.	The NFE Policy clearly spells out how NFE programmes should be coordinated, registered, monitored and by the governing organization, which is responsible for NFE matters therewith. The Policy will contribute towards ensuring responsive literate and occupational skills training for economic and socio-economic growth of the country.  One of the strategic policy areas is the Establishment of NFE department or office	or	Open	College	or	Open	University,	with	full complement of staff and upgrading of NFE positions. 
• The Open College or University will provide both short and long Courses, ranging from the period of one or two (2) weeks, one (1) month, three (3) months, six (6) months and even a one (1) year programme, awarded accordingly. • The Open College or University will develop programmes that bridge the gap between the Upper Basic Education and the university education. 
• Establishment of Open College or Open University	–	OC	or	OU	has	less	cost	as	it	uses	the	available human resources to provide both the credited and non- credited courses and programme.
The Ministry of Education and Training offers NFE courses through different institutions at various levels: These institutions include, Lesotho Distance Teaching Centre (LDTC), Institute of Extra-Mural Studies (IEMS), Lesotho College of Education and the Lerotholi Polytechnic. The main NFE providers in Lesotho are the NGOs such as the Lesotho Association of Non-Formal Education (LANFE), Good Shepherd Sisters (GSS), Lesotho Girl Guides Association (LGGA), Kick4Life and others. Currently the participation rate in Non-Formal Education is	estimated	at	around	11	000	according	to	the	Statistics	Bulletin	of	2016/17.	There	are	also	various initiatives supported by NGOs (Box 4.3.3 below).
Box 4.3.3: Innovation in Non-Formal Education Programme
Sepheo is an NGO based in Maseru, Lesotho that works with families and individuals on the fringes of society. These include street children, girls exchanging sex for money or goods, those with violent and dysfunctional caregivers, children who have dropped out of free primary school and those who have been abused, severely neglected and exploited. In 2014, Sepheo opened a full-time therapeutic primary school tailored to the needs of children deemed unreachable, ensuring those traditionally left behind are retained in school and progress academically. The school utilises:
• A combination of online and classroom learning that allow children to catch up on their education at their own pace. When ready, children sit the same Primary Leaving Exam as students in regular schools, ensuring they are eligible for mainstream high schools, vocational schools and employment;
• Global best-practice resources in both mathematics and reading, allowing children to track their own progress and celebrate milestones; • Daily reading classes using small group tutoring to systematically progress children through benchmarked literacy material; and
• Dedicated social workers working both with the children at school and at home with their families. 
Counselling, physical training and life skills are built into the school timetable, as are activities designed to help children with attention, emotional healing, conflict resolution and relationship building. Children receive two nutritious meals a day and earn their school uniform through good attendance, sleeping at home and learning to show respect for self and others. The Sepheo program has a 95 percent success rate keeping children off the streets and in families and communities. The significant majority of graduates go on to mainstream high school and employment.
Sepheo, Lesotho, June 2019
4.3.2.6 Sexuality Education and menstrual hygiene
Lesotho has made tremendous efforts to reduce costs of menstrual hygiene products by removal of the related tax earlier this year. Many young girls, especially in rural and poor families face cost barriers in accessing menstrual hygiene products and this often affects their ability to attend school. The work being done to reduce these barriers and help overcome menstrual stigma and discrimination will go a long way to helping young girls access school education free from shame and discomfort.
GoL recognizes these challenges and is committed to invest more on comprehensive sexuality education to ensure that children and adolescents have the knowledge and skills to protect their sexual and reproductive health and rights. Studies have shown that sexuality education is effective in changing sexual behaviours and gender norms and can lead to a reduction in teenage pregnancy and spread of HIV and other STIs. 
Violence against children and adolescents is a real concern in Lesotho including in school settings. The Violence against children survey published	in	2019	highlighted	this	grim	reality.	Among those who experienced sexual violence in childhood, it showed that of 6.2 percent of those girls missed school due to this sexual violence. The survey also indicated that classmates and schoolmates were among the most common perpetrators of sexual violence for both	boys	(13.5	percent)	and	girls	(10.7	percent). 
Finally, challenges in the collection, analysis and use of disaggregated data on education especially at district level, is an obstacle in designing targeted programmes that will ensure inclusive and equitable education for all. 

4.4. Goal 8: PROMOTE SUSTAINED, INCLUSIVE AND SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH, FULL AND PRODUCTIVE EMPLOYMENT AND DECENT WORK FOR ALL

“Unemployment is one of the biggest issues that this country has, some of the most apparent causes of this is politicization of job positions, nepotism, favoritism. People are not hired on the basis of merit, and this hinders the economic growth of our country and the individual livelihoods of everyone, especially young people. People are exploited in informal employment sectors, and our patriarchal society puts young women in an impossible position, where they are expected to trade their bodies and sexual favours for employment. Despite this there is a large number of youth who are showing potential and making efforts towards propelling their own lives through entrepreneurship. 
We suggest that small trade centres which showcase local produce and products be developed in each district in order to remedy this.”
Youth Voice from Qacha’s Nek District, May 20194.4.1 Lesotho Economic Growth and Employment Indicators
The Kingdom of Lesotho has a potential to be a strong and prosperous nation capable of robust economic growth and jobs creation as demonstrated by its macro-economic policy and programmes, which have been largely conducive to	strong	economic	growth.	In	the	1970s	and	1980s,	the	gross	domestic	product	(GDP)	grew	at annual average of 8 percent. But during the 1980s	and	1990s,	the	growth	slowed	down,	but	remained relatively strong, averaging 3.9 percent and 4.2 percent. Annual GDP has been growing by an average of 4.5 percent between 2008	and	2014,	which	is	40	percent	faster	than	the average in the Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). However, such growth has not been inclusive and poverty remains widespread. 
Figure 4.4.1 presents a visual illustration of trends in the annual GDP and GDP per capita	growth	rates	over	the	past	five	years	(20132018).	


40The GDP annual growth rate is the annual percentage change in the value of GDP from the previous year. The dotted line indicates the cut-off period after which the SDGs were implemented.
Figure	4.4.1:	GDP	Annual	Growth	Rate	(2013-2018),	Lesotho

Source: Lesotho National Accounts (2018)
Lesotho has experienced lower economic growth	since	2015	with	GDP	growth	at	1.2	percent	and	GDP	per	capita	growth	at	0.5	percent.	These are due to both internal and external factors, including low domestic investment and FDI, slow growth of the private sector MSMEs in particular, slow economic growth in South Africa,	and	global	oil	and	financial	challenges.	Figure 4.4.2 presents sectoral analysis of Lesotho’s annual GDP growth over the two periods Figure 4.4.2: GDP Growth and Per Capita 2015	(left	panel)	and	2018	(right	panel).	The	primary sector had the lowest contribution to GDP, but the share improved from 9.8 percent in	2015	to	11.2	percent	in	2018.	The	improved	performance	was	due	to	a	significant	increase	in the contribution of the mining sector despite, a decline in the contribution of agriculture due to changing climatic conditions in recent years (Central	Bank	of	Lesotho,	2017).
The Real sector
Figure 4.4.3: Real GDP Growth Over time
Data source: Central Bank
The contribution of the secondary sector to GDP remained consistent in the two periods as around 21 percent. The moderate performance in the sector was mainly due to improvements in the manufacturing	sub-sector	attributed	to	increased	domestic	demand	in	2016.	However,	this	positive	impact was countered by the slow growth of exports of textiles into the US market. The tertiary sector contributed the largest share to GDP growth. The sectoral contribution remained consistent at 59.8 percent	before	the	implementation	of	SDGs	in	2015	and	during	the	implementation	period	(2016	-	2018)	at	58.8	percent20.
Figure 4.4.4: Sectoral contribution of Annual GDP (percent)
Figure 4.4.3 indicates the real GDP growth rates. The economy grew by about 6.5 percent	in	2008	and	2010.	While	economic	growth	dropped	to	2.1	percent	in	2009,	it	recovered	in	2010	and	2011,	before	dropping	to	2.1	percent	in	2013.	The	economy	experienced	-2.1	percent	growth	in	2017	before	recovering	by	1.1	percent	in	2018.	It	is	evident	that	weak	political	institutions have had a negative effect on the country’s ability to grow and generate employment and hence its ability to increase revenue to	finance	the	2030	Agenda’s	Goals.	Lesotho’s economic growth has largely responded to both global and local macroeconomic and political developments as with most indicators discussed above.

The large segment of the economy comprises of	the	informal	business.	In	2014,	the	2014/15	Continuous Multi-Purpose Survey (CMS) show that 38 percent of the total working population were employed in the informal sector. During the same period, the sector employed more females at 45 percent than males at 33 percent. The MSMEs sector is also important for Lesotho’s	economy.	In	2014,	the	sector	contributed	44.2 percent of GDP.42 
Lesotho is a member of a number of regional economic arrangements, including the Southern African Customs Union (SACU), the South African Development Community (SADC) and the Common Monetary Area (CMA) among others. Through these arrangements, Lesotho has been able to source the majority of its imports from South Africa duty-free (under SACU) and at zero currency conversion-related transaction costs, as the Loti is at par with the Rand (under CMA). The country’s products also enjoy access to international markets through trade preferences provided under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) and Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs). Lesotho’s international competitiveness has improved over the recent years, compared to its counterparts in the SACU region and within SADC. In 2017,	Lesotho	ranked	100th	out	of	190	countries globally in the World Bank’s Doing Business	2018	Report.	It	ranks	eighth	in	the	Ease	of Doing Business in Sub-Saharan Africa. Several positive developments have contributed to the improvement, including the opening of the One-Stop Business Facilitation Centre and the establishment of the Credit Bureau.
4.4.2 Job Creation and Decent Work  The Government of Lesotho recognises that creating decent employment to address the increasing number of people in need of jobs is one of the major challenges the country is facing. The rate of unemployment increased from 25.8 percent in the second quarter of 2014/15	to	32.8	percent	in	the	second	quarter	of	2015/1621. Figure 4.4.5 also shows that the rate of unemployment is higher among females. The rate of unemployment for women increased from 31.2 percent in the second quarter	of	2014/15	to	40.7	percent	in	the	second	quarter	of	2015/16	while	the	rate	of	unemployment	for	men	changed	slightly	from	20.6	to	20.9	percentin	the	same	period.	In	addition	to	facing higher unemployment rates, women are mostly employed in low-paying jobs such as in textiles and agricultural sectors.22  
Figure 4.4.5 continues to show that the rate of unemployment is relatively high among the youth. Youth unemployment rate increased from 31.2 percent in the second quarter of 2014/15	to	35.8	percent	in	the	second	quarter	of	2015/16.	The	high	rate	of	unemployment	among youth is mainly due to limited job opportunities in the private sector and the mismatch between skills demand and supply45 .

Figure 4.4.5: Unemployment Rate by Sex and Youth Unemployment, 2014/15-2015/16
Figure 4.4.6 shows that the country has not progressed fast enough in creating job opportunities	since	2014.	This	was	due	to	the	subdued demand for Lesotho products in the US markets. 46There was a slight increase in employment in the Lesotho National Develop-ment Corporation (LNDC) - assisted companies	between	2016	and	2017,	but	the	number	of	employees	remained	below	the	2014	level.	Employment in the LNDC - assisted companies increased	significantly	between	2017	and	2018	as	a	result	of	establishment	of	new	firms.47Figure 4.4.6: Number of Employee per sector, 2014-2018

4.4.4 Economic Productivity, Competitiveness and Diversification
According to the Ease of Doing Business Ranking, Lesotho’s international competitiveness improved over the past six years, from 144 out of	189	in	2012	to	100	out	of	190	countries	in	2017/18.	Lesotho’s	exports	have	grown	slowly	since	2015	but	remain	concentrated	in	few	products and markets. Exports to South Africa have become	more	diversified	with	148	products	at	HS 6-digit level, compared to the 31 products destined	to	the	US	and	10	to	the	EU	markets.	To	diversify the export sector, new products have been developed and new markets have been explored.	Specifically,	Lesotho	has	started	exporting	dried	fruit/rosehip	and	plants	used	for	pharmaceuticals to the EU. As a result, exports to	EU	increased	by	US$700,000	between	2011	and	2017.	Furthermore,	the	market	for	trout	has	expanded to Japan and South Africa over the past six years. 
4.4.5 Lesotho Action and Programmes In line with the theme “People-Centred Development” Lesotho has put in place programmes and initiatives that are expected to stimulate economic growth and creation of decent jobs, particularly for the youth. NSPD II has articulated the key pillars for growth as follows:
• Promoting inclusive and sustainable economic growth (All SDGs).
• Strengthening human capital (SDGs 3, 4,  5, 6,	10,	13)
• Building enabling infrastructure (SDGs 6, 7, 9, 11,  12, 13)
• Strengthening governance and sustainability system (SDG 5, 13, 16 and 17)
NSDP II emphasizes the necessity to pursue sustainable inclusive growth as the most effective route for poverty reduction. It sets out the growth strategy anchored on four productive sectors that have the greatest potential to create jobs and achieve sustainable inclusive growth. The four sectors in NSDP II were chosen on the basis of at least four features: • Job creation potential
• Inclusive economic growth potential• Comparative advantage existence or poten-
tial
• Sector’s multiplier effect or impact across multiple sectors
The Government has introduced strategic measures to empower the people and support the poor and the most vulnerable. The strategic targets increased inclusive growth in four key priority sectors namely, Agriculture, Manufacturing, Tourism and Creative Industries, and Technology and Innovation. 
Targeting, supporting and strengthening macroeconomic resilience for inclusive growth and employment creation is critical. Another area of importance is investing in smart agriculture and increasing rural wealth, promoting inclusive trade and entrepreneurship, in particular supporting MSMES. To achieve these, the GoL will effectively manage government spending and remove	any	inefficiencies	in	spending;	ensure	low	and	stable	inflation	rates	which	is	not	only	key to achieving the nation’s competitiveness but also important for protection of incomes of the poor. It will also ensure sustainable levels of	fiscal	deficit	and	maintaining	sound	external	balances. Fiscal policy will be targeted at providing public goods and services that improve national welfare but at the same time support

the private sector development.
Lesotho tourism sector has potential for creating decent work for young people and accelerating economic growth. GoL, therefore, will increase additional resources and invest in creating enabling environment that will attract local, regional and international investors to the sector. This will include creating relevant legal and policy frameworks, investing in packaging and marketing Lesotho tourism, quality assurance, and creating incentives for investors.
In order to overcome job creation related challenges experienced in the implementation of NSDP, the country adopted the Big Fast Results (BFR) methodology to create a producer-based economy led by the private sector in	2018.	So	far,	the	country	has	implemented	the	first	two	stages	of	this	methodology,	namely setting strategic direction and Lesotho Economic Labs (Box 2).48

In	2018,	Lesotho	adopted	the	Big	Fast	Results	(BFR)	methodology	in	order	to	achieve	the	NSDP	II	key priority area of promoting inclusive and sustainable economic growth and private sector-led job creation. The implementation of BFR is coordinated by the Ministry of Development Planning. 
The	BFR	methodology	focuses	80	percent	of	its	efforts	on	identifying	strategic	projects	that	create	jobs	and	private	investment	and	the	remaining	20	percent	efforts	on	facilitating	the	Government	to	commit in building the required infrastructure. In Lesotho, it focuses on generating more GDP, investment and jobs focusing primarily on the four productive sectors namely Agriculture, Tourism & Creative Arts, Technology & Innovation and Manufacturing.
Implementation	of	the	BFR	methodology	began	at	the	end	of	2018	with	a	Cabinet	workshop	for	Government ownership. The second stage, which is the Lesotho Economic Laboratory was implemented	at	the	beginning	of	2019	for	a	period	six	weeks.		This	stage	is	a	5-step	approach	to	objectively	identify and unlock investments for the productive sector. The stages are explained below;
Project Identification 
All potential project owners were requested to complete an initial investment form to determine the investment value and potential jobs creation for the productive sectors

and the projects are then categorized based on the star-rating system
Round 2 Assessment 
Project	owners	complete	the	standardized	project	and	financial	assessment	forms	and	highlight	pertinent issues which require government intervention to unlock the investment. 
Problem solving
Various problem-solving sessions are conducted by relevant Ministries, Departments and Agencies to resolve issues and accelerate project implementation. 
Implementation Plans and KPIs
Detailed implementation plan of each project is documented to ensure ease of tracking and monitoring for the future Delivery Unit and implementation team. KPIs are formulated based on milestones for each project to measure the success of implementation. 
4.4.6 Addressing Youth Employment:
Lesotho is committed to achieving full and productive employment and decent work for all, including women, youth and people with disabilities and equal pay for work of equal value. In its SDG Baseline Report50, Lesotho acknowledges the increasing number of youth entering the labour market without job prospects. Young people are disproportionally affected by unemployment and experience high rates	of	inactivity,	unemployment	and	low	access	to	earning	opportunities	(Figure	4.4.7).	Specifically, youth living in rural areas and with low levels of educational attainments are consistently and significantly	worse	off	in	terms	of	their	likelihood	of	being	productively	employed	(Figure	4.4.8).

If the current large cohort of young Basotho would be productively employed, the country could leverage demographic opportunity for inclusive economic growth. Recent simulations show that by improving education, employment and productivity among the younger generations,23GDP per capita in Lesotho could more than	triple	by	2050.	However,	with	the	status	quo, a child born in Lesotho has a productivity rate of 37 percent at 18 years of age.24The consequence of an underproductive youth is the imminent tragic loss of human and economic potential.  

...not all of them are equally affected by the same constraints

Lesotho HBS (2018)Figure 4.4.8. Not all youth are the same… The economy has not been able to create enough jobs despite consistent growth in the past decade, where GDP grew on average 4.2 percent, mainly driven by agriculture and manufacturing (apparel)25. Wage employment opportunities are limited, especially among youth with only 34 percent being in wage employment. The Government is the formal sector’s largest employer with one of the highest wage bill in the world (21 percent of GDP).26However, only 8 percent of the employed youth have access to public sector jobs 27. 

The Government has instituted commendable policies, strategies and programs framed in the National	Youth	Policy	(NYP)	2017-2030	that	guides government interventions and is to “empower all Basotho Youth through the effective integration of youth into socio-economic development issues of the country”. To this end, the first	set	of	goals	and	actions	envisaged	in	the	NYP explicitly target youth economic empowerment and skills development. It puts inclusivity of disadvantaged youth at the center and recognizes the role of self-employment and entrepreneurship in unlocking youth’s economic potential. These initiatives include the following:
• In	2018,	the	country	developed	the	Decent Work Country Programme 2019-2023, which is aligned to the NSDP II and the SDGs and provides a framework for implementation of the decent work agenda. It covers promotion and protection of the rights of workers and advocates for providing an enabling environment for sustainability of SMMEs. 
• The country adopted a Youth Policy	in	2017.	This Policy provides a framework for empowerment of youth. It aims at enabling youth to develop social, economic, cultural and political skills with a view to enhancing their participation in the development process. The Policy also provides a framework for creation of employment for youth. In addition, the Ministry of Gender, Youth, Sports, and Recreation has been implementing Youth Employment Promotion since 2012.	This	program	conducts	entrepreneurial	trainings for young potential and existing youth entrepreneurs	in	the	10	district	and	has	since	trained	more	than	2000	youth	and	women.	The	program also links youth to technical trainings, markets and information on opportunities available for youth entrepreneurs. 
• Institutions of higher learning have implemented programs aimed at promoting entrepreneurship among youth. These include the Limkokwing University of Creative Technology which has established the Limkokwing University’s Entrepreneurship Acceleration Platform (LEAP) with the vision of achieving sustainability and a lasting economic growth in the country. On the other hand, the National University of Lesotho (NUL) launched the Innovation Hub in 2018.	These	programmes	empower	students	to think beyond employability and embrace entrepreneurship and in turn contribute to employment creation for the youth. 
4.4.7 Tourism as a vehicle for Job creation and Economic Growth
Figure 4.4.9: Travel and Tourism Direct Contribution to Employment (2014-2018)

Source:	Travel	and	Tourism	Economic	Impact	(2018)Lesotho Tourism sector has great potential of contributing to faster economic growth and creating decent jobs. Figure 4.4.9 indicates the contribution of travel and tourism to employment	beyond	2016.	In	2016,	there	was	an	increase in the contribution of employment by travel and tourism, but experienced a decline in 2017	and	2018.
Employment in the tourism sector also varies by	gender.	In	2017,	the	proportions	of	skilled	and unskilled employees constituted 49 percent and 51 percent respectively. Out of the skilled employees, males constituted 41 percent while females constituted 59 percent which means the skilled employees are predominantly females.		From	2016	to	2017,	16	new	accommodation facilities were established, and this has contributed to increased employment. Besides new accommodation facilities, there was Maletsunyane	Braai	Festival	in	2017	that	led	to	more	tourists visiting Lesotho and establishment of rural homestays.  
The GoL has therefore developed Tourism Action Plan, which articulates the national tourism	master	plan	for	the	next	20	years.	The	master plan has been divided into two 5-year short-	and	medium-term	priorities	and	one	10year	long	term	priority.	These	are	reflected	in	the Action Plans, namely the Tourism Development Areas Plans for six priority areas and this Tourism Action Plan. There is also the National Tourism Policy that incorporates all the stakeholders in tourism industry. This policy is inclusive and addresses gender dimensions and	community	benefits.	During	2017,	the	World Bank approved US $13.4 million as additional	financing	for	the	second	Private	Sector	Competitiveness	and	Economic	Diversification	Project (PSC II). Part of this funding is going towards the construction of a Tourism and Handicraft Information Centre that will serve as a reference point and retail centre for both tourists and locals.56
4.4.8 Domestic Financial Institutions and Access to Financial Services
as computed by the number of commercial banks branches, Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) and Non-Bank	Financial	Institutions	(NFBI)	per	100,	000	adults.		
Figure 4.4.10: Number of commercial bank branches, ATMs and NFBIs per 100, 000 adults (percent changes)

	Source:	Central	Bank	of	Lesotho	(2019)Lesotho recognizes is committed to increasing access	to	financial	services	as	a	critical	vehicle	for inclusive growth and private sector competitiveness.	In	Lesotho,	banks	remain	key	financial institutions to facilitate access to formal financial	services.	Figure	4.4.10	presents	Basotho	accessibility	to	formal	financial	services	

The Central Bank of Lesotho data shows that over	the	period	2015-2018,	the	number	of	commercial branches only increased by three, from 47	branches	in	2015	to	50	in	2018.	As	a	result,	the proportion of commercial banks remained at	three	branches	per	100,0000	adults.	However,	the	number	of	ATMs	increased	from	180	in	2015	to	196	in	2018,	translating	to	12	machines	per	100,000	adults	in	2015	to	an	average	of	13	ATMS	in	2018.	The	number	of	NFBI	increased	from	101	in	2015	to	105	in	2018,	which	is	seven	institutions	per	100,000	adults	over	the	period	2016-2018.		
At	the	district	level,	the	data	for	2018	shows	that the highest number of commercial branches is in Maseru (67) while the lowest is Thaba-Tseka and Qacha’s Nek. Similarly, the number	of	ATMS	is	greater	in	Maseru	(440)	while	Qacha’s Neck has the least number (12). During the same period, the branches for NBFIs were more in Maseru (32) and the least in Thaba-Tseka (2). This shows that the interventions in	the	financial	sector	have	not	been	effective	for	the	districts	to	increase	access	to	financial services in the rural districts such as Thaba-Tseka and Qacha’s Nek. 
The improvement is also evident through the share of the population that have access to financial	institutions	or	mobile	money	service providers in recent periods. The share of adult population that own an account with a	financial	institution	or	a	mobile	service	provider	increased	from	18.5	percent	in	2011	to	45.6	percent	in	2017.	This	improvement	also	reflects	across	the	gender	groups.	The	proportion increased from 16.9 percent of females in 2011	to	46.5	percent	in	2017	while	it	also	increased	from	20.2	percent	for	males	in	2011	to	44.6	percent	in	2017.	The	data	shows	that	in	the	share	of	the	poorest	40	percent	to	total	population	that	has	an	account	at	the	financial	institution or a mobile money service provider also	increased	from	7.1	percent	in	2011	to	32.4	percent	in	2017.
In	January	2014,	the	GoL	launched	the	Lesotho Credit Bureau, under the Credit Reporting 
Act	of	2011,	to	improve	access	to	credit	infor-

17http://www.lesothoreview.com/contents/tourism
mation and streamlined the processes and procedures for transferring property. The Bureau also reduces the level of indebtedness in the country and, in so doing, encourages safe lending, which positively impacts the country’s economic	development.	By	2016,	the	Bureau	had collected data from 19 credit providers on more	than	90,000	borrowers	with	about	4,000	queries per quarter. The actual impact of the Bureau	was	reflected	in	2017	where	Lesotho’s	ranking in terms of ‘accessing credit’ improved from	152	to	82	out	of	190	countries.	Consequently, during the same period Lesotho’s overall performance in ease of doing business improved. The coverage has currently extended to 7.1 percent of adult population. The bureau also disaggregated its records by gender, increasing	the	share	of	overall	beneficiaries	from 3 to 7 percent.  
The use of digital technology and connectivity is important to the future of all economic sectors	including	banking.	In	2017,	Lesotho	Post	Bank signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to facilitate collateral for SMMEs and simplify	their	access	to	finance.	Lesotho	Post	Bank further introduced the new digital channels	in	2018.	These	include	internet	banking	facilities, mobile banking as well as merchant banking. These products were implemented to increase	access	to	finance	and	reduce	the	cost	of banking transactions. In addition, the Central Bank of Lesotho developed a Collateral Registration	Bill,	which	was	published	in	2018	to	protect	consumers	from	financial	institutions.	
4.4.9 Next Steps Going Forward
•Creation of a conducive socio-cultural and policy environment that is sensitive to women, adolescents, youth and people with disabilities remains critical. This includes enacting Domestic Violence Bill and Disability Equity Bill and operationalising the Youth Policy. 
•The creation of additional decent jobs and faster economic growth are key to poverty alleviation in Lesotho. Therefore, the current skills mismatch need to be addressed in order to realise the outcomes of the recently adopted Lesotho Economic Labs. 
•In	the	next	five	years,	the	Government	will	need to strengthen efforts, working with various partners, to mobilize resources and effectively implement the NSDP II. 
•Lesotho needs to create enabling environment and enhance ease of doing business and attracting FDI and regional and global businesses. Investment in tourism promotion, diversification	of	tourism	products,	packaging	and marketing is critical going forward.
•Promotion of trade, in particular through MSMES, is critical and urgent. 
•The country needs comprehensive and robust labour market statistics and systems.
•While the GoL is committed to global labour laws, standards and requirements, creating	healthy	and	HIV/AIDs	free	working	environment, it needs to strengthen efforts towards promotion of labour rights for decent employment. 
•Investing more in women empowerment programmes to make it easier for them to get into to the labour market and ensure their protection from abuse and their SRHR needs are adequately met. to increase their productivity.
•Increase mobile and outreach services to factory workers where women are 91 percent of the work force.

While we recognize the progress our Government has made in empowering women and young girls through education, anti-GBV campaigns and other efforts, we believe that to achieve a truly equal society, it is of extreme importance that the institutions of learning, employment and government are decentralized to afford every citizen an equal chance. We need to bridge the gap between the rich and the poor and eliminate any kind of corruption and politicization of job positions and opportunities. Every citizen of this country, every young person, has the right to fair treatment and protection against discrimination. Our schools and places of employment should re-evaluate the influence of religion and its potential to deny some of the most basic social needs, and rights of our people, especially the young. Members of the LGBTI community, people with disabilities, women and anyone that forms a minority group in Lesotho, is as much a citizen as the rest of us. As we align ourselves with the principle of “Leave No One Behind” the following issues cannot go without mention: high rates of teenage pregnancy, early child marriage, unsafe abortions that result in a high maternal mortality as well as youth unemployment. This is why we urge every stakeholder and citizen to prioritize this principle in their individual and joint efforts to implement and achieve ALL the 
SDGs.
Youth Voices, from Thaba-Tseka, June 2019Lesotho has made good progress in lifting people out of poverty. But large disparities remain in the country, including disparities in income, access to food, health care, social protection, education, and land, among others. According to	2018	UN	Human	Development	Report,	Lesotho ranks 159 out of 189 countries in terms of Human Development Index (HDI). This HDI of	0.52	places	Lesotho	within	low	human	development countries. If we take into account inequalities in Lesotho, the HDI drops by 31 percent	to	0.359.
In terms of gender inequality, Lesotho is ranked 135 out of 189 countries on the Gender Inequality Index (GII) with a value of 54.4 percent. GII shows the loss in potential human development due to inequality between female and male achievements in three dimensions; reproductive health, empowerment and the labour market. Poor access to health, SRH, HIV services especially for women and young people leads to high levels of teenage pregnancy and maternal mortality. In addition, there are high levels of gender-based violence with one study reporting that 84 percent of women in Lesotho have experienced violence in their lifetime.
Lesotho recognizes that there exists various dimensions and drivers of inequality in the coun-

try. The dimensions cut across four domains and are manifested across the population, regions and sectors: The domains include the following:
i. Child poverty and inequality domain: child poverty by dimension of deprivation, including lack of income and resources to sustain livelihood (SDG 8), malnutrition; limited access to education, health and other basic facilities and services (SDGs 3, 4, 5, 6, 7); and discrimination and violence and lack of protection (SDG 5,	10,	16).
ii. Economic domain: equality of outcome or result (equality of income and wealth), right to decent start in life, access to material resources such as income, employment, housing, land and other physical assets, livelihoods, among	others	(SDGs	8,	10,	16,	17).
iii. Equality of opportunity domain: equality of access (or of life chances), includes access to basic services like health, education and training. It also includes access to food, and nutrition, water and sanitation, shelter, and information among others (SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,6).
iv. Political domain: political participation, civil equality and civil engagement, voting, equality before the law and access to justice (SDGs 16, 17).
v. Social domain: membership in society and equality of treatment, friendship, kinship, family, clan, neighbourhood, community, and social movements	(SDGs	5,	10,	16,	17).
Based on studies and experience across the country, the main drivers of inequality in Lesotho include: Age (children, adolescent, youth, old), gender, ethnicity, location (distance from main roads, terrain and physical accessibility, migrant situation, citizenship status, language, religious	affiliation,	health	condition,	ability	and	disability, and sexual orientation.
Lesotho cannot talk about inequalities without talking about risks and vulnerability. Every two to three years, Lesotho faces droughts and other weather related crisis. Government-led assessment indicates that there is a minimum of	200,000	people	hungry	every	year	and	about	400,000	people	on	average	every	year. Lesotho is therefore determined to address all dimensions of inequalities. This is a pre-condition for the country to achieve the three dimensions (economic, social, and environmental) of	2030	Agenda	for	sustainable	development.	The GoL recognizes and appreciates the fact that there are many Basotho (children, adolescent, people with disabilities, youth, women, young and old people) across the country that are	vulnerable	and	if	not	specifically	targeted	they could lack choices and opportunities required	to	actively	participate	and	benefit	from	development progress. 
Lesotho has made encouraging progress in reducing inequalities of all forms across the country. The Government has therefore put in place inclusive and empowering programmes and safety nets to support such people. Despite the	encouraging	progress,	the	inequality	gap	–	economic, social, political and environmental still persist. The most hit hard are the poor and most vulnerable children, adolescents, youth, women headed households, special groups including people with disabilities, migrants, sex workers, and trans-genders, in particular those in rural areas and urban poor.
 
4.5.2 Lesotho Action: Policy Frameworks and Programmes
To address the inequality challenges, Lesotho has made good progress in developing relevant legal and policy frameworks and plans. There are also various programmes and initiatives targeting those left behind and discriminated against, thus not enjoying the fruits of development and social progress in Lesotho. In all these initiatives, gender equality and women´s empowerment is cross-cutting and has been mainstreamed.
In	2003,	the	Government	of	Lesotho	adopted	its Gender and Development (GAD Policy) with the view to achieve gender equality and empower women in various sectors. There are also other relevant legislations namely, Legal Capacity	of	Married	Persons	Act	2006,	Amendment	of	Companies	Act	of	2011,	Financial	Institutions	Act	2008,	Labour	Code	Wages	Act	2012,	National	Assembly	Electoral	Act	2011,	Enactment	of	Sexual	Offences	Act	2003,	Anti-Trafficking	in	Persons	Act	2011,	Children’s	Protection	and	Welfare	Act	2011,	Education	Act	2010,	Penal	Code	2010,	and	Land	Act	2010,	among others.
Recognizing the various dimensions of inequalities in Lesotho, the NSDP II emphasizes the necessity to pursue sustainable inclusive growth as the most effective route for poverty reduction and providing greater opportunities to access inclusive and quality social service. Economic growth is not an end in itself but it is the only reliable mechanism for achieving sustained reduction in the number of people living below	poverty	line.	The	benefits	of	growth	are	therefore	influenced	by	the	pattern	of	income	distribution. A highly unequal distribution reduces the impact of growth on the incidence of poverty, whereas an effective pro-poor growth strategy will improve income distribution by ensuring	that	the	benefits	of	growth	are	broadly	shared resulting in inclusive growth.      
4.5.3 Lesotho GEWE for the SDGs and Inclusive Development
The country is committed to promoting gender equality and women´s empowerment (GEWE) as a development strategy given that women form 51 percent of the country´s population. Gender mainstreaming is a cross-cutting issue in the NSDP II, thus forms part of addressing economic, social and environmental aspects of sustainable development across the country (SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 10, 13, 16 and 17).
Lesotho participated in the 4th World Conference of Women in 1995, and signed the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action in the same year. The country is committed to undertake a comprehensive national-level review of the progress made and challenges encountered in implementing the Platform for Action for the achievement of gender equality and empowerment of women. It has just prepared Beijing +25	Review	Report,	where	it	looked	back	at	five	years of progressive milestones of achieving both the strategic objectives and actions of the Declaration.
Despite existing cultural and political challenges, the Government of Lesotho continues to be committed to mainstreaming gender into all policies, programmes, plans and budgets. The NSDP II mainstreamed gender in all thematic areas with clear indicators aligned to the SDGs. 
This is done in order to see improvements, progress and success with regard to prevention and eradication of sexual and gender-based violence, HIV, exploitation, infant and maternal mortality, unequal division of unpaid care work, inequalities in the control over productive resources, food insecurity and hunger, inequalities in access to paid employment, gender disparity in decision-making positions. Inclusive, targeted and sustained efforts will be required to tackle underlying challenges that hamper progress towards gender equality in Lesotho.
The ten-year Gender and Development (GAD) Policy	2018-2028	is	implemented	through	multi-sectoral approaches inclusive of all Government ministries, local authorities, civil society organisations, faith based organizations, academic institutions, and private sector and development agencies. The Policy is aligned to the international and regional instruments including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), SADC Protocol on Gender and Development, Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women CEDAW; Beijing Declaration and Plan of Action; the Commonwealth Plan of Action for Gender Equality 2005-2015,	AU	Protocol	to	the	African	Charter	on Human and People’s Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa and AU Solemn Declaration on Gender Equality in Africa, among others. At the local level, it aligns to the national protocols such as the National Strategic Development Plan	(NSDP)	and	Vision	2020.	Gender	equality forms a critical area of concern in the GAD Policy. Within this context, the Policy aims to achieve the national vision, mission, goals, objectives and guiding principles.
Addressing Gender Based Violence (GBV): The	GoL	committed	to	finalization	of	laws	to	address	Domestic	Violence	(2018).	With	the	support of development partners, other positive efforts include:
• Developing capacities within the Disaster Management Authority (DMA) and the Lesotho Vulnerability Assessment Committee (LVAC) to address GBV in emergency initiatives rolled out over	the	2018-2019	Season;
• Gender	focused	reviews	of	the	National	HIV/AIDS Policy; 
• The Prevention and Eradication of Gender Inequality Programme; 
• The Domestic Violence Bill; • The Ending Child Marriage Act. 
• The Gender for Equality and Justice Assessment	(2016-2020)	leading	to	the	development	key indicators for monitoring gender in Lesotho; and, 
• Establishment	of	a	national	simplified	and	integrated referral system for GBV survivors, and child protection.
The	2018	Global	Gender	Gap	Index	Report	indicates that there are major shifts in the status and conditions of women. To some degree, there is a narrowing of the gender gap, while there is a widening inequality in general between	the	rich	and	the	poor.	In	2018,	Lesotho	was ranked at 81 on Global Gender Gap Index having closed about 69 percent of its overall gender gap and ranked 14 in Sub- Saharan Africa. The Report further shows that Lesotho slips several ranks due to stagnant progress on wage equality. The country is ranked number one in terms of educational attainment and 86 on political empowerment and 88 on economic participation and opportunity. 
Lesotho Government is concerned that adolescent girls and women, especially the poor and those living in rural areas, are vulnerable to	health	challenges	and	HIV/AIDS,	GBV,	sexual abuse and violence at home, at work and in learning institutions. This need closer attention and inclusive programmes.
4.5.4 Lesotho Bridging Economic Inequality 
Gap
The GDP growth rate averaged 4.5 percent between	2010	and	2014,	then	declined	to	2.5	percent	in	2015	and	recovered	to	about	4.6	percent	in	2017.		Analysis	using	information	from	2010	and	2017	Household	Budget	Surveys	(HBS)	indicates a decrease in inequality between the two	survey	points.	The	Gini	coefficient	declines	from	55.7	in	2010	to	41.2	in	2017.	This	is	due	to two factors: First, the income share of the poorest	40	percent	increase	from	3.4	to	5.38,	between	2010	and	2017.	This	is	equivalent	to	annual growth rate of 9.7 percent. Second, the income	share	of	the	richest	10	percent	fell	by	28 percent during the seven years. 
4.5.5 Lesotho Women´s Empowerment and 
Leadership 
Lesotho	Government	has	made	significant	progress with regards to women’s participation and representation in leadership and decision-making positions. To highlight a few achievements, the country has a female Chief Justice, Governor of Central Bank, President of the Senate and had a female Speaker of the National Assembly.	The	figure	4.5.1	below	shows	the	share	of Basotho women in top positions in selected sectors. The private sector, viewed through the financial	sector,	has	the	lowest	proportion	of	females in top positions. For instance, all executives in the four banks are male and there is only one female to ten males across the insurance companies.  Low women representation ultimately translates to limited access of women to enhance gender economic planning that advocates for women economic empowerment and well-being. The lower employment rates for women in positions of power is evidence of the lower perceived status of women in the country. The employment segregation means earnings inequality or gender poverty gap in favour of males. That is, female headed households tend to have higher levels of poverty.
Figure 4.5.1: Share of Women in top positions
The	2018	Global	Gender	Gap	Index	Report	indicates that there are major shifts in the status and conditions of women in Lesotho. To some degree, there is a narrowing of the gender gap, while there is the widening of the inequality gap in general between the rich and the poor. In	2018,	Lesotho	was	ranked	at	81	on	Global	Gender Gap Index having closed about 69 percent of its overall gender gap and ranked 14 in Sub- Saharan Africa. The Report further shows that Lesotho slips several ranks due to stagnant progress on wage equality. The country is ranked number one in terms of educational attainment, 86 on political empowerment and 88 on economic participation and opportunity. 
The GoL and various groups recognize that more need to be done to promote GEWE and reduce inequalities based on sex and gender in both the public, private and social spheres and institutions across the country. One major area is harmonization of customary laws with civil laws to remove inequalities and empower women economically, socially and politically. Supporting and empowering special group of women including sex-workers, adolescents and young girls living with disabilities, and factory workers, is also another area of challenge that needs attentions.
4.5.6 Child Protection Progress Children are one of the Lesotho´s greatest resource. They make up approximately half of the country´s population. Every one of these children has the potential to make positive contribution to the future of the nation. For this to happen, children must be protected from violence, abuse, harm, exploitation and neglect so that they can grow to their fullest potential (SDGs	1,	2,	3,	4,	10,	and	16).	Lesotho	passed	Children	Protection	and	Welfare	Act	2011,	which made access to basic services like education and health a human right.28The Government conducted a mapping and assessment of Lesotho´s	child	protection	system	in	2014	and	2019.	With	support	from	development	partners,	it conducted Violence Against Children (VAC) Survey.29The Survey produced high level priority indicators that are being used for decision making and programming on children protection across the country.
The Government and other stakeholders, including advocacy groups, recognize the need to strengthen the ability to generate and use evidence for decision making, programming and monitoring the impact of child protection interventions nationally and in the districts. They also recognize that there are exist structures at national and district levels to coordinate child protection responses. However, these structures need capacity enhancement, including being able to produce credible disaggregated data, coordinate and monitor the effectiveness of the existing interventions on child protection. 
4.5.7 Social Protection Programmes and 
Initiatives
tection programmes and interventions as a means to establish fairness and justice (equity) across all sectors through redistribution of national resources. It also has one of the highest social assistance expenditures in Sub-Saharan Africa. They include fee-free primary schooling, school feeding programme, bursaries in higher education, subsided health care and drugs, and generous social transfers.	Figure	4.5.2	below	shows	that,	as	of	2017,	the	social	protection	landscape	comprised	of	seven programmes which underscores the commitment of the Government in reducing inequality. Besides these seven programmes, there is also an Agricultural Input Subsidy programme, which provides farmers with seeds and fertilizers. 
Figure 4.5.2:  Composition of Social Assistance Spending

Source: UNICEF Lesotho, (2017). Social Assistance Budget BriefThe Government recognizes the preventive, protective and transformative functions of social protection in reducing poverty and inequality, guaranteeing human rights, promoting human development and economic growth. The GoL and partners, therefore, uses social proAccord¬ing to Ministry of Social Development (MoSD), about 131,552 children directly benefitted	from	the	social	protection	system	in	2018. Of	these,	108,412	children	from	37,738	households	benefitted	from	the	Child	Grants	Programme	and	70,674	households	from	the	bursary programme for orphaned and vulnerable children.	About	50	per	cent	of	the	beneficiaries	are girls. The Government allocated an additional US$2 million to the social assistance programme. Evidence-led advocacy, improvement of	public	finance,	strengthening	of	the	social	protection system and partnership with Government ministries, the European Union, The World Bank, private organizations, non-governmental organizations and United Nations (UN) agencies contributed to the achievement of the results. 
Considerable progress has been made in strengthening the social protection system. MoSD established district social protection coordination	committees	in	10	districts.	About	40	percent of the committee members are women. A Social Protection Strategy Implementation Plan, along with an M&E framework, has been finalized	to	support	implementation,	coordination and monitoring of social protection interventions. An additional 22 community councils implemented the integrated social safety nets approach. Cash payments through mobile technology	have	been	increased	to	3,200	child	grant	beneficiary	households,	up	from	2,000	in	2017.	A	seven-member	mission	from	MoSD	gained knowledge on how to expand mobile payments in Lesotho through South-South cooperation with Kenya. MoSD absorbed four UNICEF-supported positions, thus strengthening the capacity of the Ministry to manage and implement social assistance programmes. 
An integrated community development approach, using citizen service centres, was implemented in 26 councils. A total of 1,733 citizens,	including	351	children	(50	percent	girls),	were provided with public services through the centres. Four hundred savings and internal lending committees, with 7,519 (6,262 female and 1,257 male) members, were formed. The implementation of the SPRINGS (sustainable poverty reduction through income generation, nutrition and access to public services) intervention helped poor households gain access to fresh	produce	through	more	than	7,000	keyhole	gardens. To expedite poverty reduction, MoSD has prepared a community development plan to link the cash assistance programme with livelihoods.	The	SPRINGS	evaluation	findings	

reveal that the combination of the cash grants hygiene and sanitation levels and more money and livelihoods resulted in improved nutritional saved	and	borrowed	(more	than	100	and	70	perknowledge and consumption patterns, increased centage increase, respectively, with respect to the comparison mean).
Box 4.5:1 Innovation in Developing Single Data Platform from Targeting Those in Need of Support Lesotho National Information System for Social Assistance (NISSA)
The	Government	of	Lesotho	(GoL)	identified	as	a	priority	the	need	to	increase	the	efficiency	and	coverage of social protection programmes, to improve the institutional coordination, to harmonize legal frameworks, and to consolidate social assistance programmes. When fully functional, the National Information System for Social Assistance (NISSA) will become a single national registry for all social protection programmes and serve as an integrated system for targeting.  The NISSA is a	single	data	platform	for	targeting	that	was	developed	with	financial	support	from	the	European	Union (EU) and technical assistance from UNICEF and it is housed in the MoSD. It currently holds information on approximately 333,245 of Lesotho’s rural households and 64 community Councils. 
Ministry of Social Development plans to expand NISSA coverage to 12 urban areas before end of 2019	where	a	further	estimated	216,000	households	reside.
In the NISSA Database, each household is categorized into one of four poverty groups based on five	characteristics	namely	income,	food	security,	participation	in	agriculture	(land	husbandry),	ownership of livestock and ability of households to send children to school. 
The Proxy-Means Test (PMT) formula is independently computed from variables collected using a Revised NISSA Form (attached) in order to assign poverty scores for all households. A set of PMT cut-off scores have been developed to assist with reduction of inclusion and exclusion error. The poverty	classification	is	then	used	to	target	for	beneficiaries	of	MoSD	programs	such	as	Child	Grants	Programme (CGP) and OVC Bursary program. NISSA in conjunction with delivery systems of CGP have subsequently been used to deliver an Emergency Grant and can be used to target for other social assistance programmes outside the Ministry of Social Development.
NISSA is a nationwide single integrated web-based database in which socio-economic information on	all	households	is	stored	to	identify	vulnerable	population,	and	target	beneficiaries	eligible	for	different social protection programmes. According to the MoSD Social Protection Annual Review 2018,	a	total	of	115,000	households	were	recertified	and	30,116	new	households	were	registered	from	27	Community	Councils	in	NISSA	in	2018.	The	data	collection	is	on-going	in	seven	councils.	The	ongoing	data	collection	will	enable	the	database	to	reach	a	minimum	of	320,000	households	in	all	the	64	rural	councils	by	end	of	March	2019.		According	to	NISSA	data	about	29	percent	of	the	households	are	under	poor	and	very	poor	category.	The	recertified	data	presented	opportunities	for	updating	programme	information	and	beneficiaries	for	CGP	and	OVC	Bursary.			To	support	process	of	data	collection,	a	new	server	and	100	more	tablets	were	procured	and	handed	over	to	MoSD	for	collection and storage of the data. The new server has improved synchronisation of data from the field	to	the	central	hub.	The	NISSA	uses	an	MIS	which	is	hosted	by	the	MoSD.	The	MIS	assists	the	MoSD	with	targeting	of	beneficiaries	using	an	in-built	PMT	formula.	The	PMT,	together	with	the	community-based categorization process, enables the MoSD to get the results of deserving poor and	vulnerable	beneficiaries.			To	consolidate	gains	made	with	the	introduction	of	NISSA	as	a	single	registry	and	to	ensure	sustainability,	a	total	of	10	MoSD	staff	were	provided	with	knowledge	on	NISSA Management Information System (MIS). They learned how to use the system in administering processes such as payment, case management, generation of M&E reports and application of PMT. In preparation for NISSA decentralisation, wiring has been completed in three districts of Maseru, Mafeteng and Mohale’s Hoek. On the other hand, Thaba-Tseka, Mokhotlong, Leribe, Berea, Quthing and Qacha’s Nek districts were wired but not fully connected to the Lesotho Government Data 
Network (LGDN). Botha-Bothe district wiring is currently underway. Limited human resources and technical	skills	were	the	main	challenges	in	2018.
Key Constraints/Challenges in Achieving Results:
Constraints were mostly found in the domains of the enabling environment, supply and demand. The social protection coordination mechanism is not yet functional due to frequent changes in leadership. Overall system building interventions and implementation of the community development model were also slow due to inadequate and expert human resources in MoDS and the Ministry of Local Government and Chieftainship. Weak institutional accountability relationships between duty bearers and service receivers weaken the overall implementation of social protection programmes. External interference delayed the implementation of NISSA. After the NISSA training started, some outsiders who were not selected as enumerators assembled and started demonstrating. The recruitment process had to be redone, thereby delaying implementation. MoSD also has a limited budget to expand the cash assistance programme vertically and horizontally. Assistance is needed in terms of capacity building, research and effective management, and technology.

4.5.7.1 Child Grants Programme: The Child Grants Programme was introduced in different Community Councils across the country	from	2009	onwards.	The	Government	of Lesotho launched the CGP with technical and	financial	support	from	UNICEF	and	the	EU, respectively, and was fully taken over by the	Government	in	2013.	The	CGP,	which	is	unconditional in its nature and constitutes the first	cash	transfer	targeted	at	the	poor	and	ultra-poor households of Lesotho, is under the administration of the Ministry of Social Development. The objective of the CGP is to improve the living standards of Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC) by reducing malnutrition, improving their health status, and increasing school enrolment among OVC, through the provisions of a quarterly cash transfer to beneficiary	households.59The transfer value is linked to the household size, wherein households with up to two children receive a quarterly	payment	of	LSL	360	(USD	25).60Those with three	to	four	children	LSL	600	(USD	42),	and	households	with	five	and	more	children	receive	LSL	750	(USD	52)	on	a	quarterly	basis	–	covering on average 21.5 percent of a household’s income.61The	benefit	is	delivered	to	the	households in-cash, either through the private security	firm	or	through	the	local	commercial	bank.62
The CGP is targeted through a combination of Community based Targeting and Proxy Means Test (PMT), followed by a community validation process. CBT categorises each household into four Poverty categories (namely Ultra Poor, Poor, Moderate and Well Off). The PMT employs a range of wealth indicators such as household assets, dwelling conditions to compute poverty score for all households. Households with Children who are validated as Poor and Ultra Poor and fall below a certain PMT score	are	enrolled	as	beneficiaries	of	CGP	after a process of Community Validation which is meant to reduce inclusion and exclusion errors.	CGP	benefits	around	90,000	children	from	36,200	households	in	58	Community	Councils.	The current CGP expansion in six remaining Community	Councils	will	increase	beneficiary	households	to	42,500	and	estimated	105,000	children.
Box 4.5.2: Innovation in School Feeding Programme to Schools in Lesotho
Innovation: Lesotho Local Purchase Initiative
The Government of Lesotho, in partnership with WFP, provides at least one nutritious and safe	meal	to	390,000	students	per	day	in	primary schools and early childhood centres. The National School Feeding Policy promotes the home-grown school feeding approach that prioritizes sourcing of nutritious and safe food locally. WFP is supporting the Government to procure food locally in line WFP’s target to procure	at	least	10	percent	of	all	food	requirements from Local Smallholder Farmers (SHFs) globally. The annual demand for food in the Lesotho National School Feeding Programme is	10,530	MT	of	maize	meal,	and	2,106	MT	of	pulses,	with	WFP	procuring	60percent	of	both	maize meal and pulses. The Local Purchase Initiative provides a new livelihood opportunity for smallholder farmers in Lesotho to increase food production on a commercially viable basis and improve rural households’ food and income security by catalysing agricultural value chains development. The Local Purchase Initiative injects cash into rural economy and has the potential to help the Government to reduce the import bill.
Partnerships
The initiative is implemented in partnership with the Ministry of Education and Training (MoET), Ministry of Agricultures and Food security (MAFS), Ministry of Small Business Development, Marketing and Cooperatives (MSCM), FAO, LENAFU, Ministry of Social Development, Ministry of Local Government Chieftainship  and Ministry of Trade and Industry among others. 
Lesotho Country Context
The country is predominantly comprised of smallholder	farmers	that	produce	only	30	percent of the country’s annual cereal requirements. These farmers face a myriad of challenges that impede their potential to become established market actors in the Home-Grown School Feeding and other formal markets. The challenges include low production volumes, poor	quality,	low/poor	on-farm	storage	capacity,	marketing	challenges,	long	distance	from	profitable markets, lack of insurance against risk and difficulties	in	accessing	financial	resources.	
Capacity Building Intervention
These challenges are being addressed by working closely with the Government and other development partners to enhance the capacity of the smallholder farmers across the entire value chain. WFP is using pro-smallholder food procurement approaches to support the Government in purchasing food commodities from smallholder farmers for the Home-Grown School Feeding Programme. The farmers’ capacity is enhanced on quality standards, post-harvest handling & storage practices, business	skills,	financial	literacy	and	access	to market information. This initiative provides smallholder farmers with an entry point to formal markets and presents the Government with a model for demand-side agricultural market support.
Progress
WFP rolled-out the Local Purchase Initiative in	2017,	and	to	date,	over	6,000	MT	of	maize	meal and beans worth USD2 million has been procured	from	over	400	farmers	(34	percent	women).
4.5.7.2 OVC Bursary
The OVC Bursary programme was introduced in	2000,	primarily	as	a	response	to	the	impact	of HIV and AIDS, which left many children orphaned. The objective of the OVC Bursary is to provide educational support to orphans and vulnerable children by increasing their access to education. With the introduction of free primary education, the OVC Bursary re-focused on targeting pupils in secondary education.63Until	2012,	the	bursary	was	under	the	administration of the Ministry of Education and Training (MoET), after which it was transferred to the newly-formed MoSD. At the central-level, a Senior OVC Bursary Administrator oversees the programme, supported by OVC Bursary Administrators, who manage the programme at the	district-level.	In	2018,	an	estimated	23,000	beneficiaries	(OVCs)	we	supported	with	the	budget of LSL 63,766,511 while for the current financial	year	LSL	70,000,000	has	been	budgeted	for	28,000	beneficiaries
The OVC Bursary makes a direct payment to secondary schools on an annual basis in the name	of	the	respective	beneficiary	student.	The payments are meant to cover tuition and examination fees, registration cost, stationary and books, as well as special subject fees, such as science fees and boarding fees. Thus, the amount of the bursary varies by grade and type of school, however, follows the harmonized fees	structure	defined	by	the	MoET.	Costs	that	are excluded from the bursary are for school trips and fees for other special subjects, for instance computer science. 
4.5.7.3 Public Assistance 
The Public Assistance (PA) is Lesotho’s oldest safety net programme that provides permanent assistance, as well as temporary assistance to orphans and vulnerable children, severely disabled, severely ill and destitute individuals. Permanent assistance is provided in cash and in-kind on an on-going basis, whereas temporary assistance is provided up to six months for which the needy unemployed, able bodied individuals,	are	eligible.	The	cash	benefit	is	LSL	250	(USD	17)64per person, per month, amounting to approximately 87 percent of the adult equivalent poverty line, and provided in cash on a quarterly basis. Typically, districts allocate LSL	250	for	a	maximum	of	half	the	family	members.	In-kind	benefits	are	identified	on	a	caseby-case basis and can comprise food, hygiene kits, and assistive devices for persons with disabilities.65
The PA utilizes a combination of categorical targeting	and	means	testing.	Potential	beneficiaries	–	that	is	OVC,	severely	disabled	or	ill,	and	very	elderly	–	apply	directly	to	the	MoSD	district	office	or	are	referred	to	the	office	by	the	Village	Chief. Overall, targeting criteria are imprecise and	not	defined	through	guidelines.	During	the	application process, applicants must present various documents, including a letter from the Village	Chief	confirming	residency	and	need,	and	birth	certificate(s).	Subsequent	to	the	application	at	the	district	office,	a	Social	Worker	conducts a home assessment and investigation into the community to validate the information provided by the applicant. Based on the assessment the Social Worker provides a recommendation on eligibility, which is submitted to	the	Senior	Child	Welfare	Officer	for	review	and	a	final	decision.
Public	Assistance	serve	approximately	12,800	households. However, there is no information available on the category of assistance provided. 
The Public Assistance is fully funded by the Government, with an approved budget for transfers	for	financial	year	2019/20	of	LSL	37.4	million. Resources for PA are drawn from the recurrent budget and allocated to each district based on a proposal developed by the district, availability of resources, and historical expenditure of each district. 
4.5.7.4 Building Capacities of Communities in Lesotho 
Figure 4.5.3 Graduation Community Development Moddel (CDM) 
The Government of Lesotho through the MoSD has developed the Community Development Model as a sustainable intervention to build the capacities of communities to graduate from poverty and social assistance programs through livelihoods establishment (Figure 4.5.3). The model is based on evidence from engagement with communities in various districts national-wide. Community development plan has been completed.

All that needs to be done is to facilitate implementation of this plan. But the challenge is that there	is	a	huge	financial	gap	on	the	resources	needed to implement this model. The model is a backbone of the MoSD. This is because the Ministry has shifted from social welfare in social	protection/humanitarian	assistant	to	a	developmental	approach,	where	beneficiaries	are capacitated to generate their own income and rely on their assets and skills to graduate from	poverty.	With	adequate	financial	support	to	implement	the	model,	most	beneficiaries,	including those in the waiting list and those that might fall into poverty would be assisted through various projects and become income independent. 
The Ministry does not only provide grants to children and households. There are also counselling services undertaken though there is a need for conducive environment when providing these sessions, especially to children. There is a gap in child friendly facilities and assets sensitive to children in order to get to the root cause of their problems and offer full support. Moreover, the MoSD, through its Children Services Department, facilitates adoption of children and placement of children in home care facilities. However, the challenge remains with the exit strategy for these children from home care facilities. Their reintegration into the society and access to economic resources remains a challenge. This exposes them to risks of sexual harassment, abuse, exploitation, child trafficking,	among	others.	It	is	also	the	role	of	the ministry to sensitize the public about children’s rights, ending child marriage and all forms of abuse. Support is needed for such victims of abuse, including sustainable programs for juvenile’s ex-convicts and street kids. 
4.5.8 Lesotho Progress with Youth 
Programmes and Initiatives
Lesotho has a young population, with about 32 percent of population aged below 15, while those aged 15-34 years accounts for approximately 38 percent of the total population.30With unemployment rate of about 25 percent and 36 percent estimated youth unemployment, youth population in Lesotho faces challenges that are multi-dimensional and interlinked. These challenges also include, incidence of HIV, limited sexual	and	reproductive	rights/health	services,	limited skills tailored to labour market needs and	access	to	finances,	and	limited	internships	among others. With the support of the UN, Lesotho has established National Youth Advisory Panel, to champion youth inclusion and also coordinate youth voices and participation in national and district engagements.
Lesotho through the Ministry of Gender and Youth, Sports and Recreation (MGYSR) in collaboration with youth, has developed the National Youth Policy 2017-2030 (NYP).  There is also an implementation plan to guide the execution of the Policy. Many efforts and studies have been carried out to understand what issues Basotho young entrepreneurs face through engagements in different platforms. 
Aspirations for self-employment exist among youth but most of them say their ambition is limited by lack of knowledge in opening a business as well as lack of start-up funds. 
Many efforts and studies have been carried out to understand what issues Basotho young entrepreneurs face through engagements in different platforms. Aspirations for self-employment exist among youth but most of them say their ambition is limited by lack of knowledge in opening a business as well as lack of start-up funds. 
Effective implementation of Youth Policy and the plan to empower youth to increase their access to education and training (SDG 4), health services (SDG 3), decent jobs (SDGs 8, 1, 2), leadership and political participation (SDGs 16, 17) and environment protection programmes (SDGs 13, 6, 7, 14, 15) remains a challenge. More	support	is	needed	in	terms	of	financial	resources, skilled personnel, research and upto-date data, and use of technology and innovation to support the youth more effectively, in particular those in rural areas. Addressing youth unemployment and reducing new infections among the adolescents and youth remain a big challenge in Lesotho, and needs to be addressed in a comprehensive and sustainable manner. 
4.5.9 Volunteers for the SDGs The Government recognizes volunteers as critical partners for the implementation of the 17 SDGs. This is seen as a strategy to promote broader national ownership, a human rightsbased approach, gender equality, participation, inclusion	and	sustainability.	Over	100	young	Basotho volunteered and offered services during	the	VNR	2019,	including	mobilization,	advocacy, and participating in consultation workshops.
The GoL’s recognition of the value addition of volunteer	action	dates	back	to	2009	as	demonstrated through the development and implementation of the National Volunteer Corps for young graduates’ project. The volunteer database now has a total of 12,191 registered applicants among which to date 1,799 have been placed in different ministries while 9,824 await placement. The pool is bulging every year as more pool of graduates are registering whilst the absorption only guarantees 104 of the total number of volunteers budgeted under Government	every	financial	year.	This	project	enabled	the country to retain new graduates from universities and vocational training institutions. Additionally, the intervention has impacted positively on employment opportunities, sustainable livelihood, household security, natural resource and environmental management. 
With about 38 percent of the population of Lesotho between the ages of 15 and 34 years, policies and programmes targeting youth are crucial as national strategies to ensure that no one is left behind in development planning and	implementation.	In	2015,	a	volunteer	programme that is aimed at enhancing youth engagement in development frameworks enabled young people’s involvement especially in the hard to reach rural communities. Furthermore, the programme enabled the country to leverage volunteer involving structures and networks to improve their collective contribution, inputs and coordination on the implementation of various SDGs.
From	2015,	through	formal	and	non-formal	structures, volunteers have been mobilized and are active across different development sectors and are contributing to various SDG related programmes. For example, 64 UN Volunteers have supported SDG related programmes in rural areas while community based volunteers, are the pillars for preventative health, hygiene, water and sanitation and food security interventions, which are critical sectors linked to SDGs 1, 2, 3 and 6.
4.5.10 Supporting People with Disabilities
Recent estimates on the extent of disability in Lesotho ranges from 2.5 to 3.5 percent of the population.31The Constitution of Lesotho provides that Lesotho adopts policies designed to provide for training facilities, including specialized institutions, public or private; and place 

People with Disabilities (PWD) in employment and encourage employers to accommodate them.	Lesotho	ratified	the	Convention	on	the	Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN CRPD) in	December,	2008,	with	the	purpose	of	promoting, protecting and ensuring that PWD in Lesotho enjoy their human rights. 
The Government, and other stakeholders, including Lesotho National Federation of Organization of the Disabled (LNFOD), has pursued the strategy of disability mainstreaming in NSDP II,	and	specific	development	programmes	in	all	sectors. Two important frameworks exist: National Disability and Rehabilitation Policy, and the National Disability Mainstreaming Plan (NDMP). The Ministry of Social Development, in consultations with LNFOD, is in the process of	enacting	disability	specific	legislation	that	will	establish a clear legal framework for the promotion and protection of the rights of persons with disabilities. A draft Bill has been completed and validated by all relevant stakeholders and will soon be tabled before the Parliament for enactment into law.
The following initiatives exist to support the people with disability:
•Development of Disability Equity Bill of 2018 which has been tabled before Parliament for enactment. 
•Development of the Inclusive Education Policy 2018 to facilitate the implementation of disability inclusive education in mainstream education so as to promote access to education for people with disabilities.
•There is also a Free Vocational Rehabilitation Centre intended to equip PWDs who are from disadvantaged families with various skills to enable them to start their own businesses. 
•The MoSD developed a Policy for Older Persons	in	2014.	The	Policy	provides	for	the	establishment of coordinating mechanisms at different levels. This will facilitate for the effective coordination of service provision which will reduce issues of access to services. 
•Lesotho	is	the	first	country	to	ratify	the	AU	Protocol on Human Rights and the Rights of Older Persons. This is the tool that will facilitate the development of programmes that will respond to inequalities affecting older persons. 
•The MoSD launched the campaign program to address issues of discrimination, abuse, assault	and	killings	of	older	persons	in	2014.	The	campaigns	have	been	held	in	five	districts	of	Mafeteng, Quthing, Botha-Bothe, Thaba-Tseka and Qacha’s Nek. 
•Income Security: The universal pension program	was	introduced	in	Lesotho	in	2004	with	the	qualification	age	of	70	years	and	above.	However, the Lesotho Policy for older persons defines	an	older	person	as	anyone	who	is	60	years and above. The total population of older persons	in	Lesotho	is	171.467.000	which	is	8.5	percent of the total population.
•The MoSD has initiated the formation of social clubs for the elderly for promotion of active ageing and healthy lifestyle. To date, there are five	active	clubs	in	Maseru	and	one	in	Leribe.	These clubs are meant to address health related issues as well as loneliness, which contributes to other mental health problems such as anxiety, depression and dementia.
4.5.11 Lesotho Migration Programmes and 
Initiatives 
Government of Lesotho (GoL) has made migration a major theme of Lesotho’s foreign and public	policies,	as	is	reflected	in	Vision	2020	and the National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP). Lesotho has actively participated in the Global Compact on Migration (GCM), Migration Dialogue for Southern Africa (MIDSA), and other inter-governmental policy dialogue forum. The forum called National Consultative Committee on Migration (NCC) has played a key role to address the migration issues in Lesotho. The NCC is consisted of inter-Ministerial, multi-sectoral stakeholders dealing with migration issues in Lesotho including academia and migrants’ associations. NCC is chaired by Ministry of Home Affairs and co-chaired by IOM. 
NCC has undertaken a number of interventions which led to the development of frameworks in the	area	of	migration	since	2012.	These	initiatives were funded by the ACP-EU Migration Facility	projects.	In	2017,	NCC	was	instrumental to review the draft GCM to come up with the Lesotho country inputs which was submitted to GCM Secretariat. Lesotho United Nations Development	Assistance	Plan	(UNDAP)	20192023	listed	“an overall score of Migration Governance Indicator (MGI)’’ as one of the UNDAP Outcome indicators. Similarly, NSDP II articulates the issues of migration and development.
 
Remittances are estimated at 15.1 percent of GDP	in	2016,	which	mostly	originate	from	South	Africa.	According	to	Census	2016,	179,579	Basotho are currently out of the country, 124,386 of them in South Africa, and others in the rest of Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States.
The Government of Lesotho has achieved significant	progress	in	the	development	of	migration related policies in recent years (Figure 4.5.4). Labour Migration Management Policy was developed by Ministry of Labour and Employment	(MoLE)	in	March	2018.	Border	and	Migration Management and Assessment was conducted	in	May	2018,	and	based	on	which,	Immigration Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) Manual was produced in November 2018.	The	Eighth	Amendment	to	the	Constitu-
tion	to	allow	the	dual	citizenship	for	the	first	time	in Lesotho’s history was passed in December 2017,	and	the	Citizenship	and	Immigration	Bill	has been drafted. To effectively involve Basotho living abroad, in the country’s development, the Government through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Relations (MoFA) started diaspora engagement in South Africa in preparation of diaspora policy development.

Prior	to	2013,	Lesotho	was	among	the	largest	beneficiaries	of	Official	Development	Assistance	(ODA) in Africa. During that period, net ODA to Lesotho showed an upward and steady trend. In 2013	net	ODA	to	Lesotho	was	USD320.67	million.	However,	in	2014	it	declined	by	approximately	66.58	percent,	to	USD107.17	million,	which	is	equivalent	to	its	1988	level.	In	2015,	the	net	ODA	to	Lesotho declined further by 22.42 percent to USD83.14 million (Figure 4.5.5). Thereafter, net ODA has	been	increasing	by	at	least	30	percent	per	annum.

Lesotho	recognizes	that	there	are	global	factors	that	affects	ODA	flow	to	the	country.	Domestic	factors	such	as	continued	political	instability	and	limited	financial	prudency	are	major	contributing	factors.	The	GoL	is	committed	to	firmly	addressing	these	domestic	factors,	going	forward.	

4.5.13 Next Steps Going Forward Lesotho has made considerable progress in reducing inequalities across the country. However, GoL, working together with various partners including development partners, the private sector, CSOs and local government and communities, is committed to addressing the existing challenges, taking into consideration the available opportunities. The focus will include the following: 
• Supporting the implementation, monitoring and reporting on the programmes of reducing inequalities in Lesotho as articulated in the NSDP II.
• Strengthening national and district coordination structures and mechanisms to effectively address inequalities and effectively manage social protection programmes across the country. 
• Supporting and strengthening routine social protection and emergency response mechanisms is a critical factor and imperative going forward.
• Addressing in a comprehensive and inclusive manner the challenges of health, HIV & AIDS, GBV, sexual abuse and violence at home, at work and in learning institutions.  
• Finalisation of the Domestic Violence Bill, review and harmonisation of various pieces of legislations and policies, and ensure their effective enforcement. 
• Allocation	of	adequate	resources	(financial	and human) for GEWE programs, including Gender Responsive Budgeting (across MDA and local government).
• Addressing child poverty and child protection through multi-sectoral approach, joint planning and/or	joint	programmes.
• Strengthen labour market institutions to protect rights and wages of workers, especially vulnerable groups such as children, youth and women.
• Strengthening health systems and institutions in all regions, making them child, adolescent, youth and poor women friendly, and invest more in primary health care and ASRH & R.
• Supporting gender responsive research, monitoring and evaluation structures for reporting, targeting and implementation of SDGs.
• Improve documentation of lessons learned, performance and knowledge management.

“Lesotho faces a crisis brought by climate change-related disasters like prolonged drought, high temperatures and floods. These have resulted into increased poverty, conflicts, food insufficiency and increased need for assistance. Without addressing climate change and environmental issues, 
Lesotho will not be able to successfully achieve other SDGs”
 (Stakeholder at the VNR Consultative Forum, May 2019)
“To combat climate change we must conserve our rangelands and natural resources, we should not graze our animals on wetlands and we should not build houses on the wetlands, Lesotho has a lot of water that should be used to generate electricity for people in the rural areas so that they stop using cow dung, wood and shrubs for cooking and heating houses as this pollutes the environment”.
Initiatives for restoring ecosystems run by Caritas Lesotho, World Vision, Catholic Relief Services and other NGOs should be distributed and made accessible across the country.”
Voice of Youth from Semonkong, May 20194.6.1Lesotho and Climate Change Effects
Lesotho is a country highly vulnerable to adverse impact of climate change. This is because of its location, size and topography. Climate change and environmental degradation represent a threat to Lesotho´s implementation of SDGs. Particular, it poses a challenge towards addressing poverty, hunger and creating decent jobs and stimulating economic growth (SDGs	1,	2,	8,	9),	reducing	inequality	(SDG	10),	promoting gender equality (SDG 5) and protecting the environment and promoting sustainable development (SDGs 6, 7, 11, 12, 14 and 15). 
In the past ten years, Lesotho has experienced successive climate shocks such as recurrent droughts,	dry	spells	and	floods,	which	have	negatively affected communities and households’ livelihoods, with serious consequences bearing	on	people’s	food	security.	From	2015,	the climate change effects have become more frequent (every 2-3 years) compared to before. 
Climate change and vulnerability affects all segments of the population in urban and rural areas, although the rural poor are the most hit. It also affects all sectors of the economy, particularly agriculture. The convergence of multiple vulnerabilities in Lesotho has created a complex	risk	profile,	in	which	poor	households	and	communities are continually exposed to a wide range of economic, health, protection, environmental, income and climate risks and shocks. Children, girls and women bear the greatest burden as compared to men and boys. With drought and erratic rainfall, women must work harder for their families. This puts added pressure on the girls within the households, who may be forced to drop out of school to help their mothers manage the heavier burden. Women and girls spend many hours; averaging eight hours, collecting water and looking for cooking energy. This undermines productivity and fuels a cycle of poverty that limits the economic and social capital that would be generated to combat climate change.
According to the Lesotho’s First and Second National Communications, the country is likely to experience increase in temperatures, changes in rainfall patterns, increase in the rate of evaporation and increase in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. The trend analysis of temperature and rainfall indicate that overall, average annual temperature is projected to increase by 1.78-2.2OC	by	2060	(Lesotho Climate Action Report). Figure 4.6.1 shows temperature projections for four different policy	scenarios	from	2010	to	2100.	Overall,	all	four policy scenarios show increasing temperatures	for	all	the	years	up	to	2100.

Figure 4.6.1: Annual Temperature Scenarios for Lesotho.

Most policy scenarios also indicate that rainfall in the northern region of Lesotho is projected to increase	considerably	between	March	-	May	(autumn	season)	by	2100.	Similarly,	a	slight	increase	is	projected for the southern region for the same season. On the contrary, all scenarios project a decrease in rainfall between June - August (winter season) for the northern region as shown in Figure 4.6.2	(MEMWA,	2013).

The change in climate is expected to exacerbate existing environmental stresses such as drought, land degradation and loss of biodiversity and thus undermine sustainable development efforts. And if not effectively and sustainable managed, including building communities and households´ resilience, achievement of 
SDGs	in	Lesotho	will	be	difficult.	In	the	last	decade,	between	2015-2019	in	particular,	Lesotho	has experienced the heaviest burden of climate change effects. Agriculture, from where 75 percent of the population derives their livelihood, is the most negatively affected, leading to crop failure,	food	insecurity,	hunger,	conflicts	over	grazing land, GBV and child abuse, increased demand for humanitarian assistant and limited access to social services like education and health.
The droughts have also contributed to an increase in internal displacement and migration resulting in a highly mobile cohort of women (52 percent) compared to men 47 percent) in Lesotho. Migration of women to South Africa in search of jobs means that they have to leave children behind with husbands or relatives and in some cases children as household heads. This situation leaves many children vulnerable and exposed to abuse. Likewise, many women who migrate are exposed to GBV including forced and exploitative labour.32Drought-induced GBV in Lesotho has been established through a baseline study conducted in	2016.	This	study	revealed	that	GBV	incidences increased during the last El Nino drought in 2015/2016.	Various	categories	of	affected	population who were exposed to GBV risks included adolescent boys and girls, women, elderly men and women, people with disability, people leaving with HIV and AIDS. Reported GBV cases included sexual (22.8 percent), physical (26.4 percent) assaults, socio-economic deprivation	(19.5	percent),	emotional	abuse	(20.6	percent), harmful traditional practices (1.4 percent), forced prostitution (1 percent), forced marriage (2.3 percent), denial of education (2.3 percent) theft (3.4 percent), and loss of life 1.1 percent). Families adopted negative coping mechanisms such as withdrawing girls from schools in favour of boys and marrying off girls or to live with relatives.  
According to Disaster Management Authority (DMA),	(2011),	the	floods	caused	damage	to	property and loss of livelihoods estimated at M462.7 million, equivalent to 3.2 percent of the GDP. DMA Report also indicates that Lesotho experienced a major El Nino induced drought in 2015/16,	negatively	affecting	numerous	sectors	such as Agriculture and Food Security, Health. 
The	financial	requirements	to	oversee	post-disaster	recovery	and	reconstruction	were	estimated	at	over	LSL600	million	(Table	4.6.1).
Table 4.6.1: Summary of Financial Requirements by Sector

Source: DMA 2019
Recurring droughts have led to a steady decline in subsistence farming, which is a major source of livelihood in rural areas. Droughts induced by the El Nino as well as higher than normal temperatures	in	2016	resulted	in	a	steep	decline	in	food	production.	The	total	cereal	production	was	estimated	at	about	30,000	tonnes,	two-thirds	lower	than	the	previous	five-year	record.	Food	security	was negatively affected by this reduction in agricultural production and the associated increase in food	prices.	The	vulnerability	trends	have	continued	through	the	last	three	years	up	to	2019.		Figure	4.6.3	indicates	the	number	of	food	insecure	people	in	Lesotho	in	the	period	2013-2019	as	a	result	of climate change effects.
Figure 4.6.3 Number of Food Insecure People in Lesotho 
Around 66 percent of total primary energy for Lesotho is biomass (wood, crop waste and dung) and remaining 34 percent is modern energy in the form of electricity, coal and LPG (SDGs 7, 14, and 15). The GoL is committed to make sure that Basotho access clean and affordable energy as a strategy for sustainable development. The Government has therefore developed	the	National	Energy	Policy	2017,	Energy	Master	Plan	2018,	Country	Action	Agenda	and Investment Prospectus, Off-Grid Regulatory framework (draft). With the support of UNDP Lesotho, the Government is implementing a project call “Sustainable Energy For All”.
4.6.2 Lesotho Programmes and Initiatives to Combat Climate Change and Mitigate its 
Effects
4.6.2.1. Legal, Policy and Institutional 
Frameworks
Lesotho has established policy and institutional frameworks to address and manage climate change effect, including the development of the National Strategic Resilience Framework (2016). This was borne out of a quest for a sustainable solution to address the multi-faceted challenges posed by all types of shocks and stresses. The important role of a National Resilience Framework is to facilitate and increased mainstreaming of climate and disaster risk management in the national and sector plan and strategies. 
Lesotho Meteorological Services (LMS) and the National Climate Change Committee (NCCC) play the central role in coordinating and mainstreaming of climate change in respective socio-economic sectors in Lesotho. LMS is the leading agency in climate and climate change issues and the focal point for the planning and execution of activities pertaining to Lesotho’s commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement. On the other hand, NCCC is a national multi-sectoral climate change coordinating body that coordinates development and implementation of policies, plans and measures to address climate change issues.
Lesotho developed the National Climate Change	Policy	(NCCP),	2017.	The	Policy	has	four pillars: i. adaptation and climate change risk reduction; ii. mitigation and low carbon development pathways; iii. governance and institutional arrangements; iv. climate finance and investment framework. The Government of Lesotho and development partners also developed the National Climate Change Policy Implementation Strategy. This strategy has	identified	three	strategic	objectives	and	outcomes towards achieving a long-term vision of building climate change resilience, low-carbon society and prosperous economy and environment	within	the	period	2017-2022.
In	2014,	the	Ministry	of	Forestry	and	Land	Reclamation	developed	in	2014	developed	a	Range Resources Management Policy to promote sustainable management of rangeland resources. The Policy aims to stimulate sustainable development and management of rangeland resources for enhanced biodiversity, optimum productivity and improved livelihoods of Basotho. 
In	2017,	the	Ministry	of	Energy	and	Meteorology put in place the Energy Policy to address a number of interrelated issues which include, among others, climate change and environmental sustainability. The Policy was developed with four goals, namely: To contribute towards the improvement of livelihoods, to contribute towards economic growth and investment, to ensure security of supply, and to contribute towards the protection of the environment. 
The Lesotho National Youth Policy of 2017, which was also developed by the Ministry of Gender and Youth, Sports and Recreation, aims to stimulate environmental awareness amongst the youth and their responsibilities towards sustainable environment and reduction of poverty. 
4.6.2.2. Lesotho Programmes and Initiatives In its effort to strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate related hazards and natural disasters, Lesotho produced a National Adaptation	Plan	of	Action	(NAPA)	in	2007.	As	part of its mandate, NAPA documented national circumstances, vulnerabilities and expected impacts from climate change in Lesotho. As such NAPA outlined priorities to use in achieving its goals. Several projects have been carried out that addresses these priorities, namely:
• Improvement of Early Warning to Reduce Impacts of Climate Change and Capacity Building to Integrate Climate Change into Development Plan	(2012/13	to	2015/16),	funded	by	Least	Developed Countries Fund (LDCF).
• Reducing vulnerability from climate change in the Foothills, Lowlands and the Lower Senqu River	Basin	(January	2015-December	2020).	Its objective is to mainstream climate risk considerations into the Land Rehabilitation Programme of Lesotho for improved ecosystem resilience and reduced vulnerability of livelihoods to climate shocks.
• Climate Change Adaptation for Sustainable Rural	Water	Supply	in	Lowlands	Lesotho	(2015	to	2019)	funded	by	AfDB.
• Strengthening Capacity for Climate Change 

Adaptation	through	Support	to	Integrated	Watershed	Management	Programme	in	Lesotho	(20152019):	this	project	is	funded	by	LDCF	and	GEF	and	implemented	by	Food	and	Agriculture	Organisation (FAO).
• Wool	and	Mohair	Promotion	Project	(WAMPP)	(2015-2022):	this	is	the	Ministry	of	Agriculture	and	Food Security project, funded by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). The project targets wool and mohair production sector, which is one of Lesotho’s primary exports.
• Integrated	Catchment	Management	–	Financed	by	the	European	Union	(EU).	The	purpose	is	to	contribute towards effective implementation of Integrated Catchment Management (ICM) in Lesotho through an improved coordination amongst relevant stakeholders.
Other projects that were implemented by development partners and non-governmental organisations include the following:
• Restoring	Ecosystems	and	Livelihoods	(REAL)	2015	–	to	date:	its	objective	is	to	produce	evidence	and good practices in reducing the effects of climate change. REAL (funded through CRS’ private funds)	has	been	implemented	since	2015.
• Diversification	for	Nutrition	and	Enhanced	Resilience	(DiNER)	and	Keyhole	Garden	(KG)	Response	to	El	Niño	Drought	Emergency,	2016	-	2018:	Implemented	in	two	phases	by	CRS.	DiNER	main	objective	was	a	response	to	the	2015-16	El	Niño-induced	drought	in	Lesotho.	
• Mountain	Integrated	Conservation	Agriculture	Project	(MICA),	2012	-	2014:	The	MICA	project	was	implemented in two phases in three districts (i.e. Mohale’s Hoek, Quthing and Thaba-Tseka), in collaboration with Caritas Lesotho and World Vision. The project funding was through OFDA.
Box 4.6.1 Innovation for strengthening resilience and adaptive capacity to climaterelated hazards
One of the major significant innovations for strengthening resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in Lesotho is the development of keyhole gardens. Keyhole gardens have been promoted in Lesotho under the auspices of the Consortium for Southern Africa Food Security Emergency (C-Safe) project which has since grown to include the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Food Programme (WFP). The program’s main goal was to enhance food security, through better nutrition, improve climate resilience and increase incomes and savings targeting households affected by HIV and AIDS. Since their inception, 23,150 keyhole gardens have been constructed, impacting approximately 115,590 people. The structures have enhanced year-round production of nutritious vegetables such as spinach, carrots and beetroot, and have enhanced income availability for other household expenses such as school fees.
The basic keyhole garden is a circular, raised-bed made up of layers of soil, ash, manure and other organic material that retains moisture and nourishes the soil, making it more productive than a conventional garden, even during dry or cold months. The gardens can produce vegetables for a family of five all year round. In Lesotho, the garden is usually walled with local stone or brick that retains daytime heat, alleviating low night time temperatures. The raised structure also makes access easier for the chronically ill or elderly. Size can vary, but the basic garden measures 1m high and 2m in diameter. A keyhole-like ‘cut out’ or walkway design gives growers ‘arms-length access’ across the garden. ‘Grey’ water from household washing is added through a central composting basket, watering the garden and continuously infusing the soil with nutrients. Once built, the garden requires little maintenance and, if cared for appropriately, can produce food for up to five years.

4.6.3 Next Steps Going Forward
“Lesotho experiences it all; mountains, lowlands, high temperatures, floods, frost, winds just name it, rivers and clean water, and other natural endowments. How we manage climate change hazard and build resilience across the country and be able to mitigate the outcomes of the hazards is critical for the achievement of other SDGs, in particular goal 1, 2, 3, 8, 10 and 16”
Voice of a Stakeholder, National VNR Conference, June 2019
 
Lesotho has realized that without effective programmes and initiatives to combat climate change and its negative effects, there will be no significant	achievement	on	SDGs.	Lesotho	has	therefore put in place relevant institutions and is taking action to increase forest cover, save water	towers/wetlands,	building	communities	and	households resilience, supporting climate science research and availability of data. In addition, Lesotho is supporting mitigation measures including humanitarian response and initiatives that reduce additional pressure on systems affected by climate change like soil erosion and drying water towers. 
In response to climate change-related natural disasters and needs, the GoL has prioritized mainstreaming and enhancing resilience and sustainable development. Considering the multi-dimensional nature of the impact of climate change, and response to be put in place, the GoL has committed to engage Development Partners, the Private Sector, CSOs, communities, youth and children to:
• Strengthen in-country coordination at national, rural, and institutional level to support knowledge sharing, increasing synergies and complementarities.
• Develop sound, comprehensive and resilience programmes;
• Build household and community resilience to threats and shocks;
• Develop early warning systems (indigenous and external);
• Address risks and vulnerabilities to climate change and other socio-economic and health challenges;
• Addressing GBV, child and adolescent protection challenges created by climate change effects.
• Seek assistance to leverage on research, technology and innovation in managing climate change and building resilience.
Addressing poverty and hunger, and humanitarian assistance in Lesotho, depends on scaling up initiatives that target building resilience and managing climate change effect on agriculture. This is because 75 percent of extremely poor people in Lesotho live in rural areas and most of them depend on eco-systems on their livelihood. Besides, agriculture sector represents	80percent	of	destructions	and	helplessness created by climate change effect.
Lesotho is part of UN CCC. But the next step is to Lesotho has to be supported to effectively implement community and household resilience building agenda: including:
• Building rural economy and supporting rural poor to be economically independent • Conserving the environment, protecting and conserve natural resources, water in particular • Supporting rural poor to diversify their income and lead a decent life
• Promoting climate smart agriculture, and moving away from dependant too much on subsistence farming, to increase productivity and food security.
• Protecting and conservation of water and wetlands
• Promoting pro-poor production technologies: 
e.g. protected agriculture e.g. green houses farming.
• Strengthening capacity to develop bankable projects	in	order	to	access	available	financing	windows.
4.7 Goal 16: PROMOTE PEACEFUL AND INCLUSIVE SOCIETIES FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, PROVIDE ACCESS TO JUSTICE FOR ALL AND BUILD EFFECTIVE, ACCOUNTABLE AND INCLUSIVE INSTITUTIONS AT ALL LEVELS.
4.7.1 Lesotho Indicators of Progress on 
Peaceful and Inclusive Societies The Kingdom of Lesotho is a constitutional democracy; committed to good governance, the pursuit of peaceful and inclusive societies and access to justice for all while building effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels. Albeit its chequered history of episodes of instability and political unrest, the search for peace and stable institutions that will support sustainable and inclusive development have been paramount endeavours of the people of Lesotho. Notable progress includes reforms to the	electoral	process	from	the	“first-past-thepost” (FPTP) to “mixed-member proportional” (MMP) representation and peaceful alternation of power between contending parties and coalitions. However, Lesotho continued to contend with political instability, which necessitated the intervention of the Southern African Development	Community	(SADC)	since	2014.	Unstable	coalition governments resulted in the country holding	three	elections	in	five	years,	between	2012	and	2017.	
Lesotho has laudably established key governance institutions such as the Directorate of Corruption	and	Economic	Offences	(DCEO),	Office	of the Ombudsman and the Independent Election Commission (IEC). Lesotho also has Parliament, Labour Court, and the Directorate of 

Disputes Prevention and Resolution (DDPR). Strengthening the capacities of these institutions remains a major challenge and a priority for the Government and its partners, including UN Lesotho.33Ombudsman has limited autonomy and capacity. Its functionality is affected by the fact that it cannot enforce its recommendations and determinations since they are not binding. Overlapping mandates of DCEO and Police Complaints Authority (PCA) is also noted.
The Legislature, the National Assembly in particular, has experienced challenges to its functioning and stability, which has also affected the stability of the Cabinet and the entire political system. The ability of the Legislature to discharge its constitutional responsibilities is severely impeded by the political instability in Lesotho. Coalition governments have become a feature of Lesotho’s political landscape. In general, these coalition governments are fragile, often held together by weak political agreements. 
Basotho view an effective local governance system as a critical vehicle for accomplishing the	country´s	efforts	in	addressing	the	2030	Agenda for Sustainable Development, in par-
ticular,
reducing poverty, promoting inclusive economic growth and entrenching democratic principles that are vital to the development of the people.	In	2014,	the	Government	formulated	and	adopted the National Decentralization Policy with the purpose of deepening and sustaining grassroots-based democratic governance and promoting equitable local development. The Policy is meant to also enhance citizen participation and strengthening the local government system, while maintaining effective functional and mutually accountable linkages between central and local governmental entities.34

4.7.2 Lesotho Action in Promoting Peaceful and Inclusive Society.
“In the SDG 16 group discussions this morning, we noted that the national dialogue and reform process is the first national process since independence that attempts to address the root causes of democratic governance challenges in Lesotho. It is the first attempt that the Government and people of Lesotho have afforded themselves an opportunity to reflect on the past challenges and forge a head together building a peaceful and just nation. If successfully completed, it will have generated a consensus reform pathway for Lesotho. The approach taken in the multi-stakeholder consensus When the same data is disaggregated by sex, men generally felt safer than women in both 2014	and	2017	wherein	67	percent	of	men	felt	safe	in	2014	as	against	63	percent	of	women	in the same yeari.	In	2017,	60	percent	of	men	felt safe as against 57 percent of women in the same year .72People living in rural areas generally felt safer than people living in urban areas	wherein	in	2014,	70	percent	of	Basotho	felt	safe walking alone in rural areas that they live in	2014	as	against	58	percent	of	for	those	living	in	urban	areas	for	the	same	year.

This represented a 6 percent drop in people feeling safe walking alone in the areas that they live.  

building grass-root consultations is applying the well rooted traditional structure- Pitsos - to engage the Basotho is an innovative way in generating a balance between policy and community level dialogue …” 73
(Group Presentation, Consultative VNR Workshop, May 2019).
4.7.2.1 Lesotho National Dialogue and Reform Agenda 
Lesotho is committed to good governance, pursuit of peaceful and inclusive societies and access to justice for all while building effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels. Albeit its chequered history of episodes of instability and political unrest, the search for peace and stable institutions that will support sustainable and inclusive development have been paramount endeavours of the people of Lesotho. Lesotho is on the road to creating lasting and sustained stability. The national dialogue and reform agenda engagements and consultations are on course as articulated in the Government’s Blue Print “The Lesotho We Want: Dialogue and Reforms for National Transformation – Vision, Overview and Roadmap”. 
The vision of the national reform agenda is “… the transformation of the Kingdom of Lesotho into a just, prosperous and stable country marked by effective and people-focused institutions; national unity of purpose; rule of law, good governance and human rights through: a) the promotion of long-term stability, unity and reconciliation; b) creation of professional, functioning	and	effective	institutions	for	efficient	management of public affairs, service delivery and development and; and c) building a national consensus on and implementation of constitutional changes as needed. 
Through the National Reforms Dialogue Act, 2018,	the	Parliament	provided	a	legal	basis	for	initiation of dialogue and implementation of the reform agenda. The implementation arrangement and process are two phased. Through consultations of all Basotho, Phase 1 of the process looks at national consensus building 

72Ibid
73Ibid
and dialogue to agree on the content of the reforms. Phase 2 shall be the actual design and implementation of the reforms as agreed in Phase 1. 
The Act established the National Leaders Forum to, provide a forum for leaders to forge political	consensus,	build	trust	and	confidence,	facilitate national dialogue and seek political level consensus. The Act also established the National Dialogue Planning Committee to design and plan the national dialogue plenaries, determine	representation,	develop	final	report	on the dialogue process, communicate with the public, provide technical support, develop guidelines for and, oversee in-district consultations. 
Current status: Upon national concurrence on The Roadmap, the Government, in partnership with UNDP, formulated the Lesotho National Dialogue and Stabilization Project, which secured funding from UN Peace Building Fund to facilitate implementation of the Reform Agenda. The focus is on initial inclusive and participatory dialogue to build consensus and urgent stabilization measures in the security sector. Through the process of shuttle diplomacy, a political settlement was reached that created the implementation arrangement and process mechanisms for the national dialogue and reforms. The process led to two successful National Leaders Forum that approved the Multi Stakeholder National Dialogue (MSND) process. The process further resulted in the “Declaration on the National Dialogue and Comprehensive Reforms” by the political leadership, establishment of a 15-member National Dialogue Planning Committee (with a functional Secretariat to steer the dialogue process and the creation of a political deadlock-breaking mechanism. 
In collaboration with UN Women and UNICEF, consensus and capacity for special interest groups - the women, youth, children, elders, traditional leaders - was built to participate in reform dialogues. The groups produced common positions articulating their issues on the reforms. The MSND Plenary I produced a Joint Communique on reforms and in-district guidelines jointly developed by NDPC and Lesotho Council of NGOs. Basotho were given an opportunity to participate and provide opinions on the reforms through 389 country-wide community level consultations (Lipitso) and 76 district level gateway meetings. Interventions in the security sector include securing the commitment and support of the High Command in the conceptualisation of the security sector policy and strategy. A counselling and psychosocial support programme for members of security sector and their spouses was initiated as well as, security sector human rights due diligence policy assessment and mitigation. The Training of Trainers on human rights and respect for rule of law among the security sector was conducted thereby creating a pool of trainers to multiply the training in their respective formations. A Communications Strategy and materials on national dialogue and reforms have been developed to ensure effective communication on reforms among the Basotho. 
The next steps shall include completion of the diaspora consultations, drafting of the general report on consultations, congregating the National Leaders Form III and calling of the MSND Plenary II. The MSND Plenary II shall constitute a decision session on the reforms content and proposals for implementation arrangements to take the process to the next level.
Lesotho Religious Organizations (Christian Council of Lesotho and Catholic Commission for Justice & Peace) are the champions of peace and stability. These organisations have organised inclusive platforms for discussions and	consensus	building	(so	far	organized	400	multi-stakeholder dialogues, useful, inclusive and open. Reports will be presented to Plenary 
II). 
4.7.2.2 End abuse, exploitation, trafficking and all forms of violence against and torture of children.
Enactment of the Children Protection and Welfare	Act	(CPWA)	in	2011	was	a	crucial	step	in	addressing issues of abuse, exploitation, trafficking,	violence	and	torture	against	children	in Lesotho. The Act provides state-of-the-art legislation, combining all elements of children’s welfare and protection in one rights-based legal framework. 
In	2013/14,	the	MoSD,	with	technical	and	financial support from UNICEF, Global Fund and EU, and World Vision commissioned a child protection system mapping and assessment exercise in order to identify strengths, opportunities, obstacles and gaps in Lesotho’s current child protection system; and develop a system that effectively protects children from violence, exploitation, abuse and neglect. The Government also conducted the costing of selected provisions of the CPWA, whose primary aim was to estimate the cost for the GoL to  implement, in a phased manner, the different services envisaged by the CPWA. 
The Government of Lesotho with support from the centre of disease control (CDC), ICAP and MoSD undertook a comprehensive Violence against Children Survey thus providing a robust evidence to inform the nation on the types, scope and drivers of violence including child marriage. This will inform policy formulation and programming.
In	relation	to	human	trafficking	in	Lesotho	and	across the borders, there exists the Anti-Trafficking	in	Persons	Act	2011,	the	Anti-Trafficking	in	Persons	Regulations	[2017].	The GoL, through the Ministry of Local Government, with the support of UNICEF and the EU, supported the creation of Citizen Service Centres, also known as One Stop Shop, where multiple services are offered to communities from	a	single	office,	thus	increasing	accessibility of services and meeting the service needs of community members, especially rural communities. 
The Ministry of Home Affairs in collaboration with the South African Department of Home Affairs, initiated the Special Permit Programme in	2015,	whose	purpose	is	to	regularise	scores	of Basotho studying, working and running businesses in South Africa. The continued implementation of this project will go a long way towards	addressing	human	trafficking	and	exploitation caused by poor border management and irregular migration. Though the MoHA, 45 percent	under-five	child	birth	registration	has	been	achieved	as	of	2016.
As	indicated	in	the	Chapter	on	SDG	10,	the	GoL	has put in place comprehensive legal and policy frameworks to address factors contributing to the general vulnerabilities of children, including, exposure to sexual violence and abuse. Key	among	these	include:	CPWA	(2011),	the	Sexual	Offences	Act	2003,	the	Penal	Code	2010	and	the	Legal	Capacity	of	Married	Persons	Act	2006.
Despite the above-mentioned interventions, the stakeholders engagement during Lesotho VNR consultation and validation workshops identified	a	number	of	challenges	towards	fast	tracking progress of the eradication of human trafficking	and	other	forms	of	violence,	namely, lack of awareness on issues of human trafficking,	lack	of	harmonised	laws,	inadequate	institutional capacity, irregular migration, poverty	and	unemployment,	lack	of	financial	capacity and corruption leading to ineffective law enforcement. The key message to combating violence	and	human	trafficking	is	through	acceleration of capacity building, improvement of appropriate referral mechanisms and response channels and prioritization of justice and governance in the national budget. 
4.7.3 Promoting the Rule of Law and Access to Justice
Lesotho is committed to promoting the rule of law and providing access to justice for all. To this	end,	Lesotho	has	made	significant	strides	towards the improvement of conditions of prisons and places of detention. There is a significant	number	of	correctional	facilities	which	have recently undergone massive renovations to bring them to the standard set by the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners. The Ministry of Justice and Correctional Services is committed to creating an enabling environment by providing a responsive and accountable justice service by offering access to justice, safe custody of inmates including child offenders, rehabilitation and re-integration of offenders. Their priority areas include: i. Safe custody, rehabilitation and reintegration of inmates, ii. Access to Legal Aid, iii. Enhanced use of non-custodial sanctions, restorative justice and diversion programme and iv) establishment of the Children’s Court.
4.7.4 Illicit Financial Flows (IFFs) and reduce corruption and bribery in all their forms In	Lesotho,	the	fight	against	corruption	is	articulated under one of the seven pillars of Lesotho’s National Strategic Development Plan	(2012/13-2016/17),	which	is	to	“Promote	Peace, Democratic Governance and Build Effective Institutions”. In the latest Transparency International ranking on the Global Corruption Perception Index, Lesotho is ranked at 74 out of 183 countries. 
Lesotho has embarked on several legal and institutional reforms in order to address different forms	of	illicit	financial	flows	(IFFs)	and	reduce	corruption and bribery of all forms across the country. Lesotho has thus established independent	institutions/offices	to	deal	with	these	issues. The following institutions have also been established and operational. 
• The Directorate of Corruption and Economic 
Offences (DCEO),
• Office	of	the	Ombudsman	
• Auditor General
• The Independent Election Commission (IEC).
• Judiciary
• Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU)
• Parliament	/	Accounts	Committee
• Labour Court, 
• The Directorate of Disputes Prevention and 
Resolution, and 
• Police Complaints Authority.
The	independence	of	these	offices	and	institutions is anchored on the various pieces of regulations, legislation that establish them including the Constitution of Lesotho. Examples of legislation that establish them include, the Prevention of Corruption and Economic Offences Act, 1999, Police Service Act, 1998, and Money Laundering	and	Proceeds	of	Crime	Act,	2008.	
Available data indicates that Basotho´s perception is that corruption had decreased between 2014	and	2017.	Figure	4.7.2		shows	that	the	proportion of Basotho who indicated that corruption had increased in the last year dropped from	57	percent	in	2014	to	41	percent	in	2017	.  The proportion of Basotho who thought that corruption had decreased in the last year, increased	from	26	percent	in	2014	to	39	percent	in	201774.  On the other hand, the proportion of Basotho who indicated that corruption had stayed the same increased from 13 percent in 
2014	to	17	percent	in	2017	.76

Figure 4.7.3 below indicates Basotho’ perception of corruption amongst the police, magistrates and judges	between	2003	and	2017.
Figure 4.7.3: Perceptions of Basotho on Corruption amongst the Police and Judges, 20032017 Source: Afrobarometer, 2019.
The	findings	indicate	that	from	2013	to	2018	the perception that the police were to a certain extent corrupt increased from 72 percent of the population to 81 percent of the population respectively .77Over the same period the public perception that judges and magistrates were also somewhat corrupt increased from 56 percent to 61 percent over the same period

Strengthening the independence and capacities of these institutions to perform their duties effectively	and	efficiently,	without	fear	or	favour,	remains a major challenge and a priority for the Government and its partners, including UN Lesotho, NGOs, FBOs and Private Sector. They require	additional,	human,	financial,	technological and capital resources for them to perform their	tasks	more	efficiently.
4.7.5 Ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels.
Lesotho is committed to making sure that there is responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels. At the international	level,	Lesotho	ratified	the	Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) in 1995. At the regional level, Lesotho signed the African Union (AU) Solemn Declaration on Gender	Equality	in	Africa	2004.	Lesotho	has	also	signed	the	AU	Gender	Policy,	2009,	the	SADC	Declaration on Gender and Development 1997 and the SADC Protocol on Gender and Development	2008.		
4.7.6 Providing legal identity for all, including birth registration. 
Lesotho has put in place legal frameworks to support the provision of legal identity. These include Children Protection and Welfare Act, 2011,	the	Registration	of	Births	and	Deaths	Act	1973,	the	National	Identity	Cards	Act	2011,	Education	Act	2010,	Lesotho	Citizenship	Order 1971 and Lesotho Passports and Travel Documents Act 1998. The MoHA, through the National Identity and Civil Registry (NICR), registers all births taking place at the government and church-owned health centres across the country while sensitizing expectant parents on the need to name their children before birth. In an effort to reach unregistered children at community level, NICR has facilitated placement of registration	officers	in	46	community	councils.	Moreover, to achieve effective implementation, the NICR organises periodic outreaches throughout the country to conduct registrations of births either on their own initiative or by invitation. 
Challenges	identified	with	the	registration	of	births, include lack of understanding, appreciation	and	awareness	on	the	benefits	of	registration and deliberate avoidance with preference to register children with alternative identities in other countries such as South Africa. Mountainous and hard-to-reach terrain also pose a deep challenge for communities to access even the closest	registration	facilities.	Insufficient	resources to reach all health facilities further exacerbates the delay in reaching the universal registration.  
4.7.7 Promote and Enforce Non-discriminatory Laws and Policies for Sustainable Development
Commendable efforts by Lesotho include creation of an enabling environment to ensure participation of non-governmental organisations in development and governance issues. In promotion of meaningful participation of children, the Government adopted Children’s Parliament, which brings together children representatives from all ten districts, including those in juvenile correction centres. 
4.7.8  Promote Public Access to Information and Freedom of the Press
Article 14(1) of the Constitution of Lesotho protects the freedom of access to information and disseminating it. However, there are limitations to this clause as stipulated in Article 14(2) of the Constitution.  The limitations relate to, among others, the interest of defence, public safety, public order, public morality or public health.
In	2015,	the	Government	rescinded	on	its	moratorium on the issuing of broadcasting licences. Following the lifting of this moratorium the number of radio stations in Lesotho increased from 13 to 24. The print media Lesotho is robust and the country has about 18 private newspapers. There is also unrestricted access to internet services as Lesotho does not have any cyber laws.
With respect to gender related issues, Priority 12 of the Lesotho Gender and Development Policy is “to promote equal involvement and representation of women and men, boys and girls in order to ensure gender sensitive reporting”.
4.7.9 Next Steps Going Forward
“Basotho of all classes and shades just want peace, stability and justice to be able to actively participate in development and live quality life, educate our children, access quality health care and security. These can only be attained if and only if there is peace and stability across Lesotho. Politicians should therefore put the interest and need of a Mosotho first”
(Voices of a Mosotho Woman during the VNR consultations, May 2019).
Going forward, to build peace, justice and strong institutions, Lesotho will among others: 
• Accelerate the implementation of the National Reforms Agenda
• Build National Peace architecture through building technocrat, administrative and administrative capacity. 
• Building local level peace architecture including creation of peace making and peace building committees.
• Strengthening the law enforcement agencies to meet the needs of special groups including children and people with disabilities. 
• Replicate the GBV Centre (Lapeng Centre) across the country. 
• Accelerate the enactment of Cyber Security Bill, to curb among others, cyber-internet based violence, especially against children and adolescent. 

4.8 GOAL 17: STRENGTHEN THE MEANS OF IMPLEMENTATION AND REVITALIZE THE GLOBAL PARTNERSHIP FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT.
“Although Lesotho has signed international developmental agreements, implementation is slow. For example, corruption (a focus element for SDG 16) continues to sky-rocket…A unilateral approach has so far not yielded any good fruits, precisely it is the reason why we have not made any visible strides as a nation since 2015. Going forward, there is need to join forces as governments, government ministries, the private sector and citizens at grassroots to advance this global mandate. It is imperative therefore to abolish the top down approach of implementation as governments, meaning an inclusion of every voice down to the local government level in prioritizing this reform, and this can be strengthened by the actualisation of the decentralisation policy.  Moreover, an incorporation of the sustainable development goals in policy framework and legislature should not just be a campaign promise for politicians but must be the foremost pursuit of our government. In conclusion, we must demonstrate a readiness to shun competition and prejudice to uphold accommodation and collaboration, because a kingdom divided against itself cannot stand”
Youth Voices from Quthing District, May 2019• Strengthen community structures to effectively undertake sensitization campaigns on the benefits	of	birth	registration.		
Lesotho	participation	in	VNR	2019	has	indicated that the country has strong will and commitment of building inclusive domestic, regional and international partnerships for addressing the	three	dimensions	of	2030	Agenda:	economic, social and environmental dimensions. Production	of	Lesotho	VNR	2019	is	a	proof	that the country has means and is committed to building effective national and district partnerships	for	effective	and	efficient	implementation of SDGs. Lesotho is a member of WTO, SADC, AU, and SACU with several bi-lateral agreement and integrated relevant regional development plans into national plans. Lesotho is also one of the leading exporters to the USA, through the AGOA and increasing export to RSA, and the European Market. Lesotho	Partnership	Policy	(2013)	and	Development partner coordination structures exist at ministerial and technical level, which is being reviewed to strengthen engagement mechanisms with civil society and the private sector. The challenges include lack of clear structures and guidelines for mobilisation and management of external assistance, which resulted in compromising	of	aid	effectiveness.	2010	Survey on Aid Effectiveness to which Lesotho was first	time	participant	revealed	the	need	for	increased aid coordination.
Lesotho has learned that mobilizing partnerships from various sectors and promoting inclusive engagement and multi-stakeholder consultation and participation, (involving MDAs, the private sector, CSOs, UN and other development partners, and special groups like children, adolescent, youth, women, and people with disabilities) is not only critical for prioritization of SDGs, but is also necessary for monitoring of and reporting on progress made on implementing the goals. Lesotho has learned useful lessons and no one will be left behind again, going forward.
Women in Lesotho make up the majority of the agricultural labour force and contribute substantially towards sustainable livelihoods and the country’s economic development. However, women farmers have little or no capacity to absorb major economic shocks as their productive capacity and productive asset base is considerably smaller compared to that of male farmers. In	addition,	59.7	percent	of	men	own	fields	and	make	decisions	on	such	fields	as	compared	to	53.5	percent	of	women	who	do	not	own	fields	but make decisions (Agricultural Production Survey	Crops,	2016/2017).	
Majority of Women in Lesotho also lack control over decision-making, and have less access to modern technologies, credit and incomes compared to men. This situation exacerbates gender inequality and increases women vulnerability	to	gender	based	violence	(CCA,	2017).	Thus,	gender	and	age	disparity	in	the	field	of	science, technology and innovation is a challenge in Lesotho. 
Lesotho has made investments in availing data and improving monitoring and evaluation. However, it is imperative to intensify mechanisms for data disaggregation, to meet the requirements of SDGs “Leaving No One Behind” principle.
4.8.1 Financial Resource Mobilization
Figure 4.8.1: Total Government Revenue as a Proportion of GDP

Data source: Central Bank of Lesotho
Figure 4.8.2 shows total government revenue as a percent of GDP disaggregated by source. Changes in government revenue are largely driven by changes in SACU revenue receipts, which have	dropped	by	about	6	percentage	points	between	2010	and	2015,	and	a	further	11	percentage	points	between	2015	and	2017.
Figure 4.8.2: Total Government Revenue (by Source) as a Proportion of GDP
Data source: Central Bank of Lesotho
While grants to the Government slightly increased from about four percent of GDP to about	7	percent	of	GDP	between	2010	and	2013,	it	plummeted	by	about	six	percentage	points	between	2013	and	2015,	and	rough-ly stayed constant since then. Domestic tax revenue and other revenue have largely remained constant	at	about	20	percent	and	5	percent	of	GDP, respectively, with little signs of improvement post	2015.Lesotho has a mixed picture in internal resource mobilization. Figure 4.8.1 presents total government revenue as a proportion of gross domestic	product	(GDP)	from	2010	to	2017.	Total govern ment’s revenue was about 54 percent	of	GDP	in	2010,	and	it	plummeted	by	10	percentage points to about 44 percent of GDP in	2012.	In	2013,	total	revenue	recovered	to	pick at 55 percent of GDP, but declined again by 8 percentage points to reach 46 percent of GDP	in	2015	(the	year	marking	the	end	of	the	Millennium Development Goals period). Since 2015,	total	government	revenue	has	continued	to	plunge,	and	in	2017,	it	was	about	36	percent	of GDP.

Figure 4.8.3 presents total government tax revenue in millions of Maloti and a proportion of	the	national	budget	from	2000	to	2017.	In	absolute terms, tax revenue has been strongly increasing	since	2000,	from	about	313	million	Maloti	to	about	6.8	billion	Maloti	in	2017.	In	terms of its contribution to the national budget, tax revenue share has increased from about 25	percent	of	the	budget	in	2000	to	about	54.3	percent	of	the	budget	in	2017.	This	increase	in	the share of tax revenues to the budget was, however, interrupted by a sharp decline between	2005	and	2010,	potentially	due	to	the	more than proportionate increase in the national budget. Further, despite this strong increase in tax revenue collections, it has not been enough to offset the observed revenue short fall driven largely by the sharp decline in SACU revenues	seen	in	figures	4.8.1	and	4.8.2.
The GoL´s efforts to mobilize resources for the implementation of SDGs is further hampered by the	decline	in	other	sources	of	financial	resources, particularly, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and	official	development	assistance	(ODA)	(Figures 4.8.3 and 4.8.4). FDI’s importance in the domestic budget increased from about 1 percent	in	2010	to	about	13	percent	in	2015.	However, it has since dropped to about 4.8 percent of	GDP	in	2017.	Similarly,	ODA	increased	from	about	58	percent	of	the	budget	in	2010	to	about	96	percent	of	the	budget	in	2013.	In	2015,	ODA	was about 88 percent of the domestic budget, and it dropped further to reach about 76 percent of	the	budget	in	2017.

4.8.2 Government of Lesotho Resource Mobilization Efforts Through Increased Exports and Dubt Payment
Lesotho	has	Partnership	Policy	(2013)	that	is	being reviewed and is in the process of developing a national partnership and coordination strategic plan to strengthen engagement mechanisms with all partners and structures including development partners, civil society, the private sector and special groups. Processes for resuscitation	of	major	financing	arrangement,	Millennium Challenge Corporation in the US, in particular, has been rebooted and programme preparatory funds have been approved.
Figure 4.8.6 shows the country’s debt service (i.e. interest payments on foreign loans) as proportion of total exports of goods and services. The	figure	indicates	that	the	country’s	debt	service	dropped	from	2.2	percent	in	2010	to	about	1.2	percent	of	total	exports	in	2011,	and	then	increased to about 3.3 percent, a 2.1 percentage points increase. This massive increase in debt service was largely driven by the weak Loti (which is pegged one-to-one to the South African Rand) during this period.37	As	of	2017,	the country’s interest payments have dropped to about 2.7 percent of total exports.Figure 4.8.6 Debt Service as a Proportion of Total Exports of Goods and Services

Figure 4.8.7 Debt Service as a proportion of Total Revenue and GDP


The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank recommend that the country’s present value of public debt to GDP ratio should be below	40	percent,	and	its	debt	service	to	exports	and	debt	service	to	revenue	be	less	than	20	percent, individually.38 The GoL undertakes regular debt sustainability analysis and adopted new analytical	framework	(IMF/World	Bank).	Based	on the above analysis, therefore, the country’s debt	is	still	manageable.	However,	the	2016	debt sustainability analysis study has indicated that the country’s present value of debt to GDP is	already	above	the	40	percent	threshold,	indicating	a	significant	threat	to	debt	sustainability.	In fact, the IMF projects that Lesotho’s public debt	to	GDP	will	reach	47	percent	in	2022.39The	Government	is	developing	fiscal	adjustment reform programme to regain sustainability, including measures to contain the balancing wage bill. Public sector census was undertaken	in	2018,	to	identify	human	capital	capacity	needs and form up the size of the wage bill to facilitate relevant needed reforms.
4.8.3 Technology
Basotho across the country need technology (ICT) to communicate, trade, send and receive money, pay bills and to be informed. In Lesotho, however, only 32.7 percent of Basotho nationwide have access to the internet and the	fixed	internet	connection	in	Lesotho	is	still	low. Out of Basotho households connected to the internet, only 3.57 percent have done so through	fixed	connection,	while	2.43	percent	have	done	so	through	fibre	or	ADSL.	The	remaining 13.86 percent and 83.68 percent have connected through USB modem or card and mobile phones, respectively. The statistics did	not	show	a	significant	difference	between	males	and	females	in	adoption	of	fixed	internet by household head.40 One of the strategic objectives of NSDP I was to facilitate smooth migration from analogue to digital broadcasting. That was to be achieved through a number of strategies, which included putting in place appropriate technology, developing and implementing public education programmed.
However, Lesotho could not meet the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) cut-off deadline	of	17	June	2015	of	switching	from	analogue to digital broadcasting due to the fact that it had to wait for its neighbour, South Africa, to switchover. This would help avoid clashes between analogue and digital signals between the two countries.41 42 The country also lacked a policy and a clear road map that would source funding for the process. The switchover process was also delayed by lack of readiness on both content and studio facilities. In order to ensure that of no one is left behind in accessing public services, the GoL has introduced electronic services for its citizens, non-citizens and businesses, which include e-VISA services, land administration services, construction permits services, labour agents, Lesotho trade portal and e-customs.4344 
The mobile network coverage in the country has increased to 96 percent of inhabited areas and consequently the phone ownership rose to over 79 percent of the population.  This is in line with the Ministry of Communications, Science and Technology’s strategic objectives of increasing	the	mobile	and	fixed	phone,	radio,	television and internet coverages.
On the digital migration front, the Lesotho government	has	completed	80	percent	of	the	work	of converting analogue broadcasting signal to digital. According to the Ministry of Communications’ broadcasting Director General, Mr. Dada Moqasa.45 Community awareness programs were made countrywide through radio, television and newspapers.
4.8.4 Government Wage Bill (public spending)
One of the factors that limit the Government’s ability	to	finance	the	SDGs’	projects	is	its	high	recurrent expenditure, which has been rapidly increasing in recent years. Figure 4.8.8 shows the trends in the government’s wage bill, both in million Maloti and as a proportion to the domestic	budget.		We	can	see	from	the	figure	that,	between	2009	and	2011,	the	wage	bill,	as	proportion to the domestic budget, increased by about 8 percent points from 35 percent to about	43	percent	of	the	budget	in	2011,	which	is equivalent to the increase of three billion Maloti.	As	of	2017,	the	wage	bill	was	about	45	percent of the budget. This implies that a small percentage of the Government budget is devoted to capital projects, including those that are	important	in	meeting	the	2030	Agenda’s	Goals. According to the IMF, Lesotho’s wage bill is one of the highest in the world, and this threatens	fiscal	sustainability	and	achievement	of	the	2030	Agenda	in	general.88 
Figure 4.8.8 Government bill over Time
4.8.5 Institutional and Coordination Mechanism for SDGs
The	success	of	the	2030	Agenda	in	Lesotho	requires a clear and strong institutional mechanism to lead the coordination and facilitate the implementation and monitoring of SDGs. The Government of Lesotho, through a consultation process, has created SDG Coordination structure and mechanism (Figure 4.8.9). Chaired by the Right Honourable the Prime Minister, SDG/NSDP	II	coordination	mechanism	brings	all stakeholders together and is supported by NSDP II Sectoral Committees. The Government has formed a Cabinet sub-committee on SDGs chaired by the Minister of Development Planning. 
The main responsibility of the Cabinet sub-committee is approving SDGs implementation plans, coordination structures and mechanism, advocacy for mainstreaming and funding, monitoring integration and inclusiveness and approval of monitoring and report reports. It is also tasked with providing policy direction and recommendations on SDGs in the context of Lesotho	Vision	2020	and	NSDP	II.	
The national institutional architecture and coordination mechanism builds into the existing government structures and also includes accountability institutions like the Parliament. The highest structure is the National Oversight and Advisory Committee, chaired by the PM. The membership is drawn from the Senate SDG Committees Chairperson, National Assembly SDG Committee Chairpersons, Minister of Development Planning (MoDP), UN-RC, UNCT, CSO/NGO	umbrella	(representative),	Private	Sector (representative), Faith Based Organisations, Women representative, Youth representative, PLD representative, District SDGs Focal Persons. 
The National Technical Steering Committee for the implementation of SDGs is Chaired by Hon. Minister of Development Planning. Membership of this Committee include Ministries Principal Secretaries (PSs), UNCT, Development Partners, Heads of Government Agencies, Heads of CSOs, Heads of NGOs; Chief Executives, and Heads of Trade Union. Its responsibility is to give technical direction to the implementation, monitoring of and reporting on SDGs. The committee is also tasked with quality assurance role.
As shown in Figure 4.8.9, there are various Technical Committees and Technical Sub.-Committees, each tied to NSDP II Strategic Pillars (Priorities). Expert Panel from the academia also plays technical role in the process, through among others, conducting research and critical analysis on SDGs.

4.8.6 Financing SDGs Implementation and Activities
Since SDGs are mainstreamed in Lesotho´s NSDP II, the implementation of SDGs is funded	through	the	public	sector	financing	(annual budgets approved by Parliament). The GoL has developed a Financing Strategy for NSDP II	that	covers	a	five-year	period.	The	framework	articulates	the	total	financial	requirements,	available	funds	and	financial	gaps.	GoL	is	also	in consultations with the UN and other development partners on building partnerships and modalities of funding and providing technical assistance to Lesotho implementation of SDGs.
4.8.7 Data, Monitoring and Accountability
Lesotho recognizes the importance and necessity to collect comprehensive, credible and comparable data in all development and social sectors.  Availability of quality data is fundamental for monitoring progress towards the attainment of the SDGs, and ensuring accountability within Government and across all sectors. Therefore, the country has made good progress in this regard. The Lesotho Bureau of Statistics Act	of	2001	that	complies	with	the	Fundamental	Principles	of	Official	Statistics	has	been	enacted. This Act also establishes the National Statistical	Office,	Bureau	of	Statistics	(BOS).	BOS	coordinates the production of both routine and periodic data across various development and social sectors. 
Lesotho has selected 152 SDGs indicators through a consultative process with stakeholders. From these indicators, Lesotho is able to report on 81 indicators (53 percent of the selected), of which, 34 Indicators have been customised. The majority of reported indicators however still suffer from lack of disaggregation on a number of variables, particularly disability, employment and wealth status. On the other hand, Lesotho is currently not able to report on 71 indicators which constitute 47 percent of the 152 selected indicators due to complete or partial unavailability of data. However, efforts are underway to close the data gaps on selected indicators. 
Through Lesotho Data for Sustainable Development Project coordinated by UNDP Lesotho, and funded by European Union, BOS has initiatives to strengthen statistical capacity in the country, in particular those of MDAs. It has also conducted diagnostic assessment on national needs and capacity for monitoring SDGs and NSDP together with data gap analysis. 
4.8.8 Data Innovation and Citizen Engagement
To support the multi-stakeholder engagement of	the	Lesotho	VNR	2019	and	to	drive	innovative approaches in engaging citizens as well as using new forms of data to track progress in SDGs, Lesotho engaged in two novel initiatives: a social media network analysis and a real time monitoring of citizen perceptions. Both initiatives were aimed at crowdsourcing progress, sentiments and gain insights towards the perceived change in the status-quo of SDGs.
 
In analyzing the outcomes of the social media over	the	period	of	12	months	(01.05.2018	–	01.05.2019),	a	total	of	45,262	posts	have	been	identified	to	relate	to	the	SDGs	being	reviewed.	From the total posts analyzed, the highest interest and engagement by the citizens was on goal 16, followed by goal 4, while had the least posts as indicated below: 
1. SDG 16 - Peace Justice and Strong Institutions (18,592 posts)
2. SDG	4	-	Quality	Education	(11,660	posts)
3. SDG 8 - Decent Work and Economic Growth 
(8,689 posts)
4. SDG	10	-	Reduced	Inequalities	(2,189	posts) 5. SDG 17 - Partnership for the Goals (2,142 posts)
6.	SDG	13	-	Climate	Action	(1,990	posts)
A visualization of each SDGs share (percentage) of the total relevant conversations by day can	be	found	in	figure	4.8.10	below.	Total	relevant conversations are the sum of relevant conversations from each selected SDG.

In addition to the social media mining exercise, citizens of Lesotho were surveyed about their recent experiences in different areas of their lives relating to SDGs and national development. During this round of micro-perception surveying, a total of 622 citizen participated either via SMS or via Social media with an overall completion rate of 83%. The perception questionnaire was derived from nationally agreed SDG	Indicators	and	the	MY	World	Scientific	Question Library developed by the SDG Action Campaign. The questionnaire had a total 11 questions and was structured around 3 broad areas: 1) work environment; 2) public & basic services, 3) societal & personal safety and security.
On the overall, the majority of respondents came from	the	age	between	21-40	(72,74%)	with	59% of respondents having completed secondary education, while female respondents (54%) slightly outnumbered male respondents (43%). Furthermore, the majority of respondents came from an urban background (46%) and are currently unemployed (47%) . 
4.8.9 Next Steps Going Forward Lesotho has made good progress in mobilizing resources, enhancing access to technology, improving policy coordination and availability of quality data. But there are challenges, that also provide great opportunities going forward: 
• There is need therefore to look for new innovative sources of revenue. Lesotho has to take advantage of lucrative markets in the EU member states, under EU and ACP Partnership Agreement; and USA through AGOA; and venturing into other trade deals regionally and internationally. But this needs effective cooperation and internal environment including improvement of ease of doing business.
• The Government will accelerate completion of the mining sector legal framework review to operationalise the developmental goals of the Minerals	and	Mining	Policy	2015.	
• The Government is in the process of public sector reforms to reduce the wage bill and improve service delivery.
• The Government will fast track the review of the National Partnership Policy and development of national partnership and coordination strategy, to enhance national, regional and international collaboration.
• The Government is strengthening Public Sector Investment Committee (PSIC) effective implementation of capital projects. • The Government is currently reviewing the National Strategy for Development of Statistics (NSDS). 
• The Government is committed to strengthen the national statistics system that will continuously generate good disaggregated quality data for monitoring and evaluating implementation of the SDGs in Lesotho.

• The Government is committed to accelerate issuance of residence and work permits to attract foreign investment.
• The Government is strengthening national and district coordination structures and mecha-

nisms across and within MDAs and enhancing multi-stakeholder engagement.
• The Government is making efforts to establish National Human Rights Commission.

5  CONCLUSIONS AND NEXT STEPS
Lesotho is committed to fast-tracking the implementation of SDGs and working with various partners, including communities, children, youth and special groups, to achieve the three dimensions	of	Agenda	2030:	economic,	social	and environmental dimensions. Lesotho has demonstrated that this is possible. The nation has already mainstreamed SDGs in the National	Strategic	Development	Plan,	2018/192022/23.	The	effective	funding,	implementation, monitoring of and reporting on NSDP II targets is a sure way of effective implementation of SDGs. Lesotho commits that it will develop effective coordination and monitoring structures and mechanisms to bridge the data gap and make accountability part of SDGs national, regional and international reporting.
Lesotho’s	participation	in	2019	VNR	has	been	a good learning experience for the Government across MDAs, the private sector, CSOs, academia, and special groups like children, the youth, women groups and people with disabilities. Advocacy, public education and awareness about	SDGs	across	districts	in	Lesotho	–	rural	and urban, and among various stakeholders have been reinforced.  But more critical, Lesotho’s effective implementation of SDGs lies on sustaining political stability and increased good governance and the rule of law, mobilizing and harnessing existing resources, and being innovative and using technology. But this will require strong leadership, effective coordination, and sustained monitoring and reporting on the progress Lesotho is making in people-centred development. 
The	Lesotho	VNR	2019,	and	the	multi-stakeholder consultations and engagement, in particular, revealed that Lesotho will not effectively achieve	2030	Agenda	and	AU	Agenda	2063	commitments if the following three imperatives are not done:
i. Accomplishing Lesotho National Dialogue and Reform Agenda, thus promoting stability and peaceful and inclusive society, with strong and effective institutions.
ii. Taking effective action to combat climate change and its effect by building community and households´ resilience, implementing effective adaptation measures, supporting and protecting agricultural sector and addressing rural poverty and inequalities of all forms;
iii. Building strong health and protection systems and addressing new HIV infections among the adolescents, youth and factory workers.
“We would like to put smiles in Basotho faces. This is because we know what smiles do. Smiles will make Lesotho a better place to live in, to raise children, to support adolescent and the youth and make all smile again and again….”
