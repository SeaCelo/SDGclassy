EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The Voluntary National Review process was open and inclusive 
Ghana’s Voluntary National Review (VNR) was conducted in an open, inclusive and multistakeholder manner with the active participation of a wide range of state and non-state actors at both national and sub-national levels. The VNR process focused on three main areas: an assessment of the institutional and policy environment for implementing the SDGs; progress made on the 17 goals; and the three cross-cutting themes – Children and Youth Engagement in the SDGs; Leave no one behind; and Synergies among the Goals. The draft report was reviewed and validated in a series of workshops for stakeholder groups to ensure that the information presented in the report was a true reflection of Ghana’s story. The revised draft report was also reviewed by the leadership of Parliament and endorsed by the High-Level Ministerial Committee (HLMC). Ghana used the VNR process to deepen public awareness and knowledge of the SDGs by engaging the media and marginalised groups such as persons living with disability, market women, school children, commercial drivers, street children, fisher folk and smallholder farmer groups.  
Status of SDGs progress 
Considerable progress has been recorded in the key indicators on the social goals but not at the rate required to achieve the SDGs targets by 2030. Overall poverty, malnutrition, maternal mortality, and under-5 mortality have all declined, while there has been a general increase in access to health services and school enrolment, with gender parity attained at basic level. There has been a general improvement in the macroeconomic environment with some key indicators pointing in the right direction and economic growth recording significant improvement. Overall performance has been mixed.  Single-digit inflation has been sustained for several years leading to a downward trend in interest rates and the budget deficit. However, unemployment has increased, especially among the youth and urban population.  The proportion of youth not in education, employment or training has also increased. Since data on environmental targets are limited, many of the indicators were not covered in the report. The proportion of the population with access to basic water services and sanitation improved, as well as the ambient water quality in the three major water basins and forest cover. However, air pollution, open defecation, and the number of people affected by disasters have worsened. There has been significant improvement in governance indicators, with the number of remand prisoners, and the proportion of persons who reported paying bribes declining. After 20 years of effort, Ghana has passed the Right to Information (RTI) law to improve access to public information and enhance accountability in democratic governance and political administration. 
Government response to the integrated and indivisible nature of the SDGs and to the principle of leaving no one behind 
The principles of the 2030 Agenda are consistent with Ghana’s Constitution, which calls for even development across the country, non-discrimination, respect for human rights, the rule of law, the efficient use of natural resources, and making provision for the needs of future generations. Policies are typically drafted through participatory processes, and programmes to address critical challenges are multi-dimensional in nature.  
Most sector-based policies, action plans and regulations are consistent with the SDGs, and reflect the dimensions of sustainable development. Key government flagship initiatives such as Planting for Food and Jobs, Planting for Export and Rural Development (PERD) and One district, one factory, have shown strong synergies towards achieving SDGs targets. For example, PERD is contributing to poverty reduction (SDG1), job creation (SDG8), and climate change adaptation (SDG13).  A multisectoral collaboration approach formed the basis for the establishment of the Inter-ministerial Committee on Illegal Mining (IMCIM) to combat illegal artisanal and small-scale mining, which is damaging forests and polluting water bodies.  
The aged, children, the rural population, persons living with disability, prisoners, the unemployed, people in vulnerable employment are some of the groups at risk of being left behind. Current programmes have been strengthened and new ones introduced to address the needs of these groups. These include the Free SHS programme, the strengthening of the Livelihood Empowerment against Poverty (LEAP), National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS), National Pension Scheme and Ghana School Feeding Programme. Others are the Financial Inclusion Programme, National Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme (NEIP), National Apprenticeship Programme, creation of the Zongo and Inner-City Development Fund, and the Special Development Authority. 
Good practices, lessons and challenges 
Ghana has instituted an effective implementation coordination arrangement for the SDGs based on the decentralised planning system. It is made up of the High-Level Ministerial Committee (HLMC), the SDGs Implementation Coordinating Committee (SDGs-ICC) and a Technical Committee (TC). The SDGs-ICC and TC have representatives from government, civil society and the private sector, while the UN Country Team has observer status on the HLMC. 
The SDGs have been integrated into the national development agenda and the Budget. The Government’s national development blueprint – An Agenda for Jobs: Creating Prosperity and Equal Opportunity for All (2017-2024) – reflects the SDGs. The guidelines for preparing medium-term development plans require ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) as well as local authorities to align their activities with SDGs. A tracking tool has been developed within the national budgeting process to monitor allocations and expenditure on SDGs-related activities.  
Ghana’s multi-stakeholder partnership approach to the implementation of the SDGs has enhanced collaborations among various stakeholders. Traditional authorities, civil society organisations, private sector, academia, youth groups, United Nations agencies and other development partners, have demonstrated their support for the 2030 Agenda through the implementation of initiatives that contribute to achieving the SDGs. 
Access to reliable and timely data at the appropriate levels of disaggregation is a major concern across sectors and at all levels. To address the data challenge, a roadmap has been drafted with three priority areas for action: filling data gaps, encouraging data use, and strengthening the entire data ecosystem. Training of officers from the MDAs is ongoing, together with revisions to data collection templates, as part of efforts to improve data production from administrative sources. The use of telecommunications and earth observation data are being explored for some of the indicators. An online SDGs data reporting platform has been launched to make disaggregated data easily accessible and a national data quality assurance framework is being developed to ensure the integrity of official statistics.  
 
Areas of Required Support 
Key areas in which Ghana needs support include linkages between research and practice, as well as building local government capacity for the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the SDGs. 
Implementing the SDGs and promoting the “Leaving No One Behind” agenda requires strong research capacity and output. Access to research findings is vital for evidence-based policy making and review. There must be intensified effort to improve collaboration between local and international research institutions and implementers at all levels. 
While the SDGs have been mainstreamed in district medium-term development plans (DMTDP), the capacity to monitor and evaluate progress remains weak. Ghana is improving local level planning, monitoring and implementation capacity through recruitment of more local government staff and appointment of statisticians at local government level. These efforts must be consolidated with effective training through the Regional Coordinating Councils (RCCs).  
 
 
 

INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND 
1.1 Constitutional Imperatives of National Development Efforts 
Ghana’s development aspirations are fully aligned with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which seek to build a world that is just and equitable with peaceful and inclusive societies. The 1992 Constitution of the Republic of Ghana provides a legal basis for the just, equitable and inclusive development of the country and enjoins all successive governments to: 
“... take all necessary action to ensure that the national economy is managed in such a manner as to maximize the rate of economic development and to secure the maximum welfare, freedom and happiness of every person in Ghana and to provide adequate means of livelihood and suitable employment and public assistance to the needy.” (Article 36, Clause 1) For the attainment of the foregoing, every President is required to:  
“... within two years after assuming office, present to Parliament a co-ordinated programme of economic and social development policies, including agricultural and industrial programmes at all levels and in all the regions of Ghana.” (Article 36, Clause 5). 
In fulfilment of these constitutional injunctions, successive governments have implemented blueprints for the development of the country, and used them to operationalise global and continental development frameworks. These include the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the African Union’s Agenda 2063, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. This practise has helped create the conditions for improved coherence and coordination in the implementation of domestic, sub-regional, continental and global development policies and programmes, while ensuring efficient use of resources.    
	1.1 	Unfinished Business under the MDGs 
Ghana’s efforts have led to notable progress, including being adjudged the first sub-Saharan country to have achieved MDG 1 – halving the proportion of people in extreme poverty – well ahead of the target date; halving the proportion of people without access to safe drinking water (MDG 7B); and attaining universal primary education (MDG 2A) and gender parity in primary school (MDG 3). Also, Ghana made substantial progress in reducing HIV prevalence (MDG 6C); increasing access to ICT (MDG 8F); and reducing the proportion of people suffering from hunger. 
In preparations towards the adoption of the 2030 Agenda, Ghana played an important role as Chair of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) during the Open Working Group deliberations, as well as the inter-governmental negotiations on the formulation and adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In addition, during the preparatory process towards the adoption of the SDGs, Ghana was selected to co-host with Denmark the Global Inequality Conference and the Pan-African Conference on Inequality and Localisation of the Global Development Agenda.  In recognition of its efforts in promoting the global development frameworks, two successive Presidents of Ghana were selected to co-chair the UN Secretary-General’s Eminent Group of Sustainable Development Goals Advocates.  
Ghana is confronted with some unfinished business of the MDGs, including the attainment of full and productive employment; reducing under-5 and child mortality; reducing maternal mortality; and reversing the loss of environmental resources and improving sanitation. These and other specific, domestic development concerns have provided the impetus for the preparation and

implementation of the current national development blueprint, An Agenda for Jobs: Creating Prosperity and Equal Opportunity for All, 2017-2024.  
The vision underlying the Agenda for Jobs is to create “an optimistic, self-confident and prosperous nation, through the creative exploitation of our human and natural resource, and operating within a democratic, open and fair society in which mutual trust and economic opportunities exist for all”.  It aims at achieving five main goals: (i) create opportunities for all Ghanaians; (ii) safeguard the natural environment and ensure a resilient built environment; (iii) maintain a stable, united and safe society; and (v) build a prosperous society.  
1.2 	Alignment of National Development Aspirations with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the SDGs 
The central tenet of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which is “leaving no one behind.” This is wholly aligned with the goal of “creating opportunity for all” in the government’s development blueprint, which aims to ensure inclusive and equitable access of all sections of the population to opportunities while ensuring their human rights. 
For the attainment of the SDGs and government’s own domestic aspirations, 16 flagship programmes are to serve as the main drivers of accelerated change. Key among them are:  
i. Digitising Ghana with the establishment of:  
- National Identification System as the primary identifier, with linkages to the databases of institutions; 
- National Digital Addressing System 
- Port Automation System; 
- Electronic payments system;  ii.  “Planting for Food and Jobs” to stimulate food production and generate incomes; 
iii. “One Village, One Dam” initiative to ensure year-round farming, especially in the Northern part of Ghana; 
iv. “One district, one factory” initiative, to establish at least one industrial enterprise in each district of Ghana; 
v. Free Senior High School (SHS) for all Ghanaian children; 
vi. A quota system of women in 30 percent of public appointments; 
vii. A policy of reserving 30 percent of poverty alleviation/credit funds of Metropolitan, 
    Municipal and District Assemblies (MMDAs) to support women’s enterprises;  viii. The Office of the Special Prosecutor to investigate and prosecute certain categories of cases and allegations of corruption;  
 ix. Passing the Right to Information Bill; 
 x. Establishing the Fiscal Stability Council; 
 xi. Establishing the Nation Builders Corp (NABCO) to reduce graduate unemployment;  
 xii. Establishing the Integrated Aluminium Development Corporation; 
 xiii. Passing the Affirmative Action Bill to increase women’s involvement in decision making at 
all levels;  
 xiv. Establishing the National Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme; 
 xv. Infrastructure for Poverty Eradication Programme (IPEP); xvi. Creation of Special Development Authorities and Zongo Development Fund; 
1.3 	Integrating the Dimensions of Sustainable Development 
“Sustainability” in the context of Ghana’s development entails integrating the three pillars of sustainability namely the socio-cultural, economic, and natural resources into policies, plans and programmes. In addition, Ghana has identified institutional development as the fourth pillar for sustainability in recognition of the important role strong and efficient institutions play in delivering sustainable development outcomes (Box 1.1).  These four pillars serve as the anchor for development planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation at all levels.  Ghana has found the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Tools1 to be an important instrument for mainstreaming sustainability which provides useful insights and lessons for policy coherence and synergies. 
 
Box 1: Strategic Environmental Assessment 
SEA is a system by which the opportunities and risks of a policy, plan or programme (PPPs) in relation to the environment are considered at the conceptual stage of decision making to ensure that the sustainability pillars – natural resources, economic, socio-cultural and institutional – are properly considered, resulting in appropriate documentation of the process and translation into desired implementation results. 
The concept of SEA has been evolving strongly in association with the achievements of sustainability practices with cumulative effects that provide a broader environmental vision, early consideration of environmental issues, and anticipation of environmental impact. The Ghana SEA approach includes a fourth pillar on institutions. The Venn diagram depicts the concept of the four sustainability pillars 
 
 The first ring represents the natural resources pillar, the second represents the socio-cultural pillar, which includes cultural aspects and takes into consideration the conservation of tangible and intangible cultural heritage, health, education, and ways of life, customs, human identity and development. The third ring is the economic pillar and the fourth is the institutional pillar which is represented by the black lines around the three rings. The institutional pillar covers issues of governance, legal frameworks, transparency and accountability, participation and institutional frameworks.  
  
Ghana is addressing climate change issues and environmental sustainability through the National Climate Change Policy (NCCP), Ghana National Climate Change Master Plan Action Programmes for Implementation: 2015–2020, and its Nationally Determined Contributions. Other relevant sectoral policies and strategies are among the policy objectives of the Agenda for Jobs (2018-2021). These focus on tackling unsustainable mining, deforestation, water and management of land. There has also been a focus on assisting local authorities to mainstream green economy in local development plans, and developing capacity to compute the indicator values based on the SDGs metadata requirements. 
In the medium-term national development policy framework – Agenda for Jobs (2018-2021) – the Social Development focus area contains measures to ensure fair and balanced allocation of national resources across ecological zones, gender, income and socio-economic groups, including PWDs, and to empower vulnerable people to access basic necessities of life. Its specific strategies include 
 	20 	 
 
investment in human capital, health, social protection, the promotion of viable and sustainable economic livelihood schemes for vulnerable people and persons with disabilities. Government’s flagship programmes such as Planting for Food and Jobs and One district, one factory aim to promote agriculture and industrial development while creating job opportunities at the local level. All of these are important given the recent slowdown in the pace of poverty reduction and the rise in spatial disparities. The Agenda for Jobs (2018-2021) also includes a focus on strengthening the capacity of oversight institutions regarding poverty reduction.  
1.4 	Sustainable Development and Ghana Beyond Aid (GBA) 
For Ghana, sustainable development also entails positioning the country to systematically wean itself off foreign aid dependency and develop into a prosperous, economically self-sufficient country that is in charge of its own destiny and capable of engaging competitively through trade and investment globally. To this effect, Ghana has developed and launched the Ghana Beyond Aid (GBA) Charter and strategy, which is aimed at:  
(i) systematically changing the mindset and attitudes of the Ghanaian away from a mentality of dependency to adopting a confident can-do spirit, fuelled by love for Ghana;  
(ii) building the capacity to effectively harness the country’s resources and deploy them creatively and efficiently for rapid socio-economic transformation; and 
(iii) promoting hard work, creativity and consistently fighting against corruption in public life.

THE 2030 AGENDA WITHIN THE GHANAIAN CONTEXT 
Although Ghana made significant gains with the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), progress was hampered by weak inter- and intra-sectoral coordination, as well as ineffective collaboration among stakeholders. This resulted in the inefficient use of resources and uneven spread of important interventions across the country. Also, the lack of reliable and timely data for some of the indicators posed a major challenge to monitoring and reporting on the MDGs. These and other lessons have informed the implementation arrangements for the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063 in Ghana.  
This section describes key features of Ghana’s approach to implementing the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063, focusing on the role of key stakeholders, awareness creation and data issues. 
	2.1 	Implementation Arrangements 
2.1.1 Decentralised Planning System 
In order to implement the 2030 Agenda and commitments under Agenda 2063 consistently and sustainably, Ghana is using the decentralised planning system as set out in the National Development Planning (Systems) Act, 1994 (Act 480). This system assigns planning functions to MDAs at national level, and to local authorities, namely Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies (MMDAs) at sub-national level. Coordination is vested in the National Development Planning Commission (NDPC) at the apex, supported by 16 Regional Coordinating Councils (RCCs). The Ministry of Planning provides policy coordination and monitoring support. Collaboration and consultation are encouraged between government agencies and stakeholders through the decentralised planning approach. Stakeholders include the private sector, civil society, traditional authorities, persons living with disability, development partners, academic and research institutions, and other interest groups. 
2.1.2 SDGs Specific Structures 
New coordination and leadership structures have been established to provide focused attention on the SDGs, build innovative partnerships and accountability mechanisms around their implementation and integrate lessons learned into ongoing national development efforts. These consist of a High-Level Ministerial Committee (HLMC), an SDGs Implementation Coordination Committee (ICC), a Technical Committee and a CSOs Platform on SDGs. Also, an SDGs Advisory Unit has been established in the Office of the President to support President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo’s role as Co-Chair of the United Nations Secretary-General’s Eminent Group of SDGs Advocates (Figure 2.1). The relationships between these structures are shown in Figure 1 below.

Structures within the decentralised 
Planning system 
 
High-Level Ministerial Committee 
The High-Level Ministerial Committee (HLMC), made up of 15 ministers, is chaired by the Minister for Planning with the President’s Special Advisor on SDGs as secretary. The Committee provides strategic direction for the implementation of the SDGs and Agenda 2063 to ensure a “whole-ofgovernment” approach to implementation, by actively engaging all parts of government in a crosssectoral and coordinated manner. The United Nations Country Team and the CSOs Platform on SDGs have observer status on the HLMC. 
The SDGs Advisory Unit provides technical, policy and strategic support to the President in his advocacy efforts on the SDGs. The Unit’s core functions include exploring innovative channels of advocacy on the SDGs, exploring ways of leveraging the President’s global role to support the domestic agenda and mobilising support for the implementation of the SDGs. 

SDGs Implementation Coordinating Committee 
The SDGs Implementation Coordinating Committee (ICC) is made up of representatives of 10 key ministries, departments and agencies; the Office of the President, SDGs Philanthropy Platform, civil society organizations and the National African Peer Review Mechanism Governing Council (NAPRM-GC). The ICC is intended to streamline and strengthen cross-sectoral coordination and multi-stakeholder partnerships in implementation, monitoring, evaluation and reporting. The committee has led the integration of the SDGs and Agenda 2063 into the planning and budgeting processes, managed stakeholder engagements , ensured follow-up, overseen progress reviews, monitored and reported on implementation and related requirements of coordination. The UN Country Team has observer status on the ICC. The National Development Planning Commission (NDPC) serves as the Secretariat to the ICC.  
SDGs Technical Committee 
The Technical Committee is made up of the SDGs focal persons of the MDAs and representatives of civil society organizations, private sector, academia and other stakeholders.  Members of the committee are responsible for ensuring integration of SDGs into development plans, implementation, monitoring and, evaluation of and reporting on the SDGs in the various sectors. The Committee also provides support to local authorities and other stakeholders for implementation, tracking and performance, advocacy, awareness creation and public education. In addition, it has responsibility for ensuring the provision of accurate and timely data for tracking progress on the SDGs and Agenda 2063. The Civil Society Organisations Platform on SDGs 
The CSOs Platform on SDGs was set up to ensure coordination and partnerships on SDGs within the CSOs space. The Platform has a membership of more than 300 local and international CSOs clustered into 17 sub-platforms aligned to each of the 17 goals. There is also a youth-focus subplatform addressing youth-related concerns in all the goals. Each sub-platform is managed by two coconveners, while the activities of the entire platform are supervised by three co-chairs. The platform serves as the focal point for engagement between CSOs, private sector and government on the SDGs. It has observer status on the High-Level Ministerial Committee on SDGs, and is a member of both the SDGs ICC and the Technical Committee. 
	2.2 	Integration into National Planning and Budgeting Processes 
 To ensure the integration of the SDGs in Box 2: The 3 A’s Localisation Approach the existing and future national development blueprints, Ghana adopted the 3A approach, which is Alignment, Adaptation and Adoption.  
Alignment:  Given the fact that the country was at the mid-stage of implementing the Ghana Shared Growth and Development Agenda 2014-2017 (GSGDA II) at the time the SDGs were adopted, government carried out an exercise to assess the extent to which GSGDA II and the associated medium-term development plans of the sectors and the sub-national governments are aligned with the SDGs. The result of the exercise showed that at least 50 percent of the SDGs have been reflected in the respective development plans. To help bridge the gap, directives were 
issued to MDAs and MMDAs to make the necessary adjustments to their 2017 annual action plans, which serve as the basis of the budget. This ensured that their 2017 programmes and budget fully reflected the SDGs.   
Adaptation: As GSGDA II was programmed to end in 2017, steps were taken to ensure that the successor medium-term national development framework fully reflects the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the SDGs and Agenda 2063. Adjustments were made to some of the goals and targets to reflect Ghana’s development context and statistical capabilities and aspirations.  
Adoption:  Where the goals and targets were consistent with Ghana’s development context and aspirations, they were adopted fully without any changes. The SDGs targets and indicators that did not require modification, together with those that were adapted, were then incorporated in the successor national development blueprint, the Agenda for Jobs, 2018-2021, and the associated medium-term development policy framework as well as sector and district development plans, and the monitoring and reporting frameworks. 
 
Box 2.2: Agenda for Jobs, 2017-2024 
The government’s Coordinated Programme of Economic and Social Development Policies – The Agenda for Jobs:  Creating Prosperity and Equal Opportunity for All, 2017-2024 serves as the basis for the preparation of the medium-term national development policy framework, which contained strategies consistent with the SDGs targets. The associated Results Framework includes several SDGs indicators. In line with the planning law in Ghana, the various sectors and sub-national governments were provided with guidelines to prepare and implement a four-year, medium-term development plan based on the Agenda for Jobs, 2018-2021. These four-year plans are translated into annual action plans, which are monitored and reviewed, with their lessons incorporated in subsequent activities. Government’s flagship initiatives aimed at addressing critical development challenges are linked to achieving one or more of the SDGs, as well as Agenda 2063 goals.

It presents a policy objective under a focus area, the associated strategies and related SDGs targets in bracket and the corresponding goals of Agenda 2063.  
Figure 2.2: Mapping of the national development agenda to the SDGs  

Ghana’s Budget has been aligned with the SDGs, with budget codes linked to one or more of the SDGs targets. The Ministry of Finance has developed a tool that helps track government allocations and expenditure on each SDG target. The allocations provide a measure of government’s actual commitment to the goals, while information on actual spending shows whether the government has followed through on the planned budget expenditure.  
	2.3 	Assessment of Government’s Readiness to Implement the SDGs 
In 2018, the Ghana Audit Service conducted a performance audit of government’s readiness for the implementation of the SDGs. The audit assessed the extent to which government had: integrated the 2030 Agenda in the national context; identified and secured resources and capacities needed for implementation; and established mechanisms to monitor, follow up, review and report on the implementation of Agenda 2030. The audit examined policy coherence and integration, legal framework, institutional arrangements, communication and stakeholder engagement, capacities and funding arrangements, mechanisms for M&E, indicators and data production, and communication strategies. 
The audit noted that government had established policies and strategies for the implementation of SDGs through a participatory approach. National development strategies had been aligned with the SDGs and had been budgeted for, using the existing integrated budgeting system. The audit also highlighted deficiencies in data availability, delays in the release of funds, and the low level of awareness of the SDGs among the general public as some of the critical issues to be addressed.  
	2.4 	The Rights Approach to the SDGs – Ghana’s experience 
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is grounded in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and other international and regional human rights instruments, including the 
African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights (ACHPR) and the United Nations Declaration on the Right to Development (DRTD). The SDGs seek to protect the rights of all, and envision a world driven by the respect for human rights and human dignity, the rule of law, justice, equality and nondiscrimination. To give effect to this, the SDGs are to be implemented in line with the obligations that arise by virtue of countries becoming State Parties to human rights instruments. 
Ghana is a State Party to the core international human rights instruments, and subscribes to the DRTD that grounds the SDGs. Specifically, Chapters 5 and 6 of the 1992 Constitution of Ghana articulate the safeguards for promoting and protecting human rights, as well as engendering sustainable development. To ensure the promotion and protection of human rights at national level, the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ) was established in 1993 in accordance with the Principles Relating to National Human Rights Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights (the Paris Principles). CHRAJ is constitutionally empowered to promote and protect all human rights in Ghana. CHRAJ holds “A” status according to the ratings of the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI).  
The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were seen in some quarters as not human rights-based and progress was measured at national level, therefore failing to track progress systematically at subnational level and among different population groups. The SDGs, on the other hand, mainstream rights-based principles premised on access to information, accountability, transparency, participation, inclusiveness and non-discrimination. The existence of national human rights institutions (NHRIs) ensures a rights-based approach to implementing the SDGs. In this regard, NHRIs including CHRAJ have responsibilities under the Merida and Kigali Declarations on SDGs to advise governments and rights holders; promote a rights-based approach to guide implementation and monitoring; develop partnerships with rights holders and civil society; hold governments accountable; shape national indicators; and promote access to justice by investigating rights violations and providing remedies.  
To ensure the realisation of all rights, CHRAJ sends advisory notes to government (e.g. Office of the Attorney-General, Ministry of Interior, etc.) in terms of reporting obligations, as well as follow ups on concluding observations, particularly in relation to the Human Rights Council’s (HRC) Universal Periodic Review (UPR) process and Special Procedures. Furthermore, to promote and protect the human dignity of persons in deprivation, CHRAJ conducts monitoring of detention facilities (prisons and police cells) in consonance with the UN Minimum Standards for Treatment of Prisoners (the Nelson Mandela Rules) and the ACHPR guidelines on the Conditions of Arrest, Police Custody and Pre-Trial Detention in Africa (the Luanda Guidelines). CHRAJ makes recommendations to relevant state institutions (duty bearers) to address rights violations in these facilities. CHRAJ has introduced a Discrimination Reporting System (DRS) dedicated to the protection of the right to non-discrimination of vulnerable groups, especially persons living with HIV and AIDS and key populations.  
Under the Public Sector Reform for Results Project, CHRAJ has been engaging the Public Sector Reforms Secretariat in drafting a standard Client Services Charter for use by Client Service Units within the public services as a means of holding public servants, as duty bearers, accountable with respect to effective and high quality public service delivery. Under the auspices of CHRAJ, Ghana is implementing a National Anti-Corruption Plan (NACAP), a multi-sectoral operational plan that aims to fight corruption in an integrated, holistic and practical manner. Among its strategic objectives, NACAP aims to institutionalise efficiency, accountability and transparency in the public and private sectors. Also, NACAP envisages mainstreaming anti-corruption, ethics and integrity in the public and private sectors of Ghana.   
	2.5 	Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting on the 2030 Agenda 
SDGs and Agenda 2063 indicators that can be obtained from administrative data sources have been included in the results framework of the medium-term national development policy framework, 2018-2021. In line with sector and district planning guidelines, MDAs and MMDAs have included relevant SDGs indicators from the results framework in their sector and district M&E plans and report on them quarterly. The Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) is supporting MDAs to update their data collection templates to conform to the SDGs metadata requirements, and build their capacity to compute the indicator values. It is also developing a quality assurance framework with the support of partners and the participation of stakeholders. 
Data for population-based SDGs and Agenda 2063 indicators are collected through national surveys including the Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLSS), the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) and the Ghana Demographic and Health Survey (GDHS) which are coordinated by GSS. New modules have been added to the data collection tools to generate data for computing SDGs indicators that were hitherto not captured in these surveys.  
As required by the National Development Planning (System) Act, 1994 (Act 480), NDPC prepares an Annual Progress Report on implementation of the national development agenda. This report which is based on the annual reports of MDAs, captures the SDGs and Agenda 2063 indicators contained in the MDA reports. In addition, there is a system to ensure that special progress reports are prepared biennially.  
Studies will be conducted at four-year intervals to assess the impact of SDGs interventions and inform future strategic actions and interventions. A mid-term evaluation will be conducted in 2024 and a post-hoc evaluation in 2031 to assess the overall outcomes of the implementation of the SDGs and Agenda 2063. 
	2.6 	Data for SDGs Reporting 
Subsequent to the adoption of the SDGs indicators of the Inter-Agency and Expert Group on Sustainable Development Goals Indicators (IAEG-SDGs) in 2016, the Ghana Statistical Service (GSS), as the coordinating body for the National Statistics System (NSS), reviewed the global set of indicators to identify data availability and gaps in Ghana. GSS identified 62 of the SDG indicators for which data had already been produced and 63 others for which data existed in different MDAs and that needed to be collated for computation. The process also mapped the MDAs that produce these data (largely administrative data) which must be reviewed to ensure they meet the metadata requirement of the specific SDGs indicators. Based on the data available, Ghana has produced a report which established the baseline for subsequent reporting.  
The preparation of the baseline report brought to the fore the urgent need to review MDA data templates and align their data production with the indicator metadata requirement to enable Ghana to report adequately on the SDGs. Subsequently, GSS developed a standardised data and metadata template to be used by MDAs in reporting data for SDGs monitoring.  Using this template, 80 SDGs indicators have been compiled and validated, and served as the basis for the preparation of the VNR report. These indicator values have been published on the National SDGs Reporting Platform.

In 2017, with support from the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data (GPSDD), GSS hosted a National Data Roadmap Forum of over 150 national stakeholders and international experts to discuss many aspects of the data ecosystem. Three priority areas for action emerged: filling data gaps, encouraging data use, and strengthening the entire data ecosystem.  
A multi-stakeholder (government, civil society, academia, media and development partners) advisory committee has been established to oversee the implementation of the resulting roadmap. The advisory committee has since established seven thematic work-streams to address specific areas of improvement in the data ecosystem. Several programmes and partnerships have been initiated in this respect. These include a partnership between Statistics Denmark and GSS to help strengthen the administrative data system; the development of a national data quality assurance framework; launch of a national SDGs data reporting platform; a partnership with Vodafone Ghana (private sector) to leverage telecommunication data and earth observation data using the African Regional Data Cube (ARDC) for SDGs monitoring. 
	2.8 	Financing for Sustainable Development in Ghana 
To raise adequate resources to finance the SDGs and to ensure that each of the goals is adequately funded, Ghana has adopted the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) as the main framework for mobilisation of resources and has developed an SDGs budget tracking tool.   
2.8.1 Implementing the Tenets of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) 
In line with the AAAA, Ghana has prioritised interventions aimed at increasing domestic resource mobilisation, as well as developing and strengthening the regulatory frameworks to better align domestic and international private business and finance with public goals.  
Domestic Resource Mobilisation  
To increase domestic revenue mobilisation, the government is strengthening revenue institutions and administration; reviewing the tax exemptions regime; diversifying sources of resource mobilisation; and reviewing existing legislation and administrative instructions regarding non-tax revenue and internally generated funds. Government is also implementing reforms aimed at broadening the tax base, while protecting low-income earners and the poor. The implementation of the National Identification Scheme, National Digital Addressing System, Tax Identification Number System, and the Presumptive Tax System, among other measures, is expected to significantly improve the environment for mobilisation of domestic resources. The Earmarked Funds Capping and Realignment Act, 2017 (Act 497) in turn limits all allotted funds to 25 percent of tax revenues in order to free resources for priority programmes.  
Government has signed onto the “Agreement for a Strategic Partnership”, which is a new framework for economic cooperation among countries. It includes a commitment to develop solutions which would ensure resilience of commodities like cocoa to price volatility in the global market. Regulatory frameworks such as the Public-Private-Partnership Policy are also serving as a means to facilitate private investment in the country.  
Enabling Environment for Domestic and International Private Business and Finance 
Government commitment to private sector partnerships to accelerate economic growth and prosperity is operationalised through initiatives such as the One district, one factory programme, to facilitate decentralisation of business activities. Government is also seeking to promote entrepreneurship through the National Entrepreneurship and Innovation Plan (NEIP), which will support new start-ups, with a focus on business development services, business incubators, and funding, especially for the youth. Other initiatives already underway include setting up of the Ghana Infrastructure Investment Fund and the Youth Enterprise Support (YES) as well as revamping the Microfinance and Small Loans Centre (MASLOC) programme.  
Programmes aimed at implementing the other thematic areas of the AAAA in Ghana include: preparation of a Ghana Development Cooperation Policy (GDCP) to serve as the principal guide for Ghana’s engagement with its development partners (DPs); completion of the governance framework for public-private partnerships; enhancement of the capacity of Ghana Exim Bank to support agriculture and industrialisation for export; implementation of the policy of re-profiling existing debt to extend maturities, reduce the interest burden, and create space for the private sector; developing borrowing guidelines that outline the procedures for borrowing by MDAs, MMDAs and SOEs; and the issuance of guarantees and on-lending arrangements by government. 
2.8.2 Tracking and Reporting on SDGs Financing through the National Budget 
Ghana developed the SDGs budget tracking system in 2018, which maps the SDGs to the national budget using the chart of accounts. It takes into account Ghana’s programme-based budget which is developed into thematic areas, sub-goals and policy objectives as defined in the medium-term national development policy framework. With this system, Ghana can now prepare cost analysis reports, track budgetary allocation to SDGs targets at national and subnational levels, as well as monitor the different sources of funding (central government, internally generated funds and DPs) for the goals and targets.  
	2.9 	Multi-Stakeholder Partnerships  
2.9.1 Private Sector Efforts 
A number of individual businesses are doing critical work to achieve sustainable models, engaging in corporate social responsibility (CSR) and philanthropy. However, greater visibility and more effective coordinated efforts are still required. Government has collaborated with the Private Enterprise Federation (PEF) to explore how to engage the private sector effectively in the implementation of the SDGs. These efforts are extended to the structures established in the context of the SDGs in order to optimise the contributions of the private sector. 
PEF has developed various resources to support the participation of the private sector. They include: a code of ethics; green employment guide (to achieve Goals 1, 2 and 8); and interventions in renewable energy to provide impetus for achieving Goals 7 and 9.  The Federation has also developed an Investor Guide to bring the opportunities that exist to the attention of members (thereby working towards Goals 9, 13 and 17).   
To ensure a coordinated approach to private sector engagement on the SDGs, the President of Ghana hosted a Breakfast Meeting with selected Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) in June 2018. The meeting aimed to: provide a forum for reflection and dialogue on the SDGs and define collective actions for accelerating their implementation; identify ways of scaling up investments necessary to achieve the SDGs; and collectively agree on financing “quick wins” to help advance efforts towards achieving the SDGs. The meeting brought together CEOs from various industries including oil and gas, mining, manufacturing, banking, consumer services and telecommunications. All the participants pledged their commitment to the 2030 Agenda and to make the SDGs an integral part of their organisation’s vision and mission. The group meets quarterly with the President to discuss pertinent issues on the SDGs. 
An Advisory Group, made up of eight CEOs representing different subsectors, is to define a set of practical actions that the private sector can undertake to support the attainment of the SDGs. The Group has identified Goals 4, 6, 7 8, 9 and 12 as focus areas for immediate action and set up an SDGs Delivery Fund to finance actions on these Goals. The Fund is to be sourced from a percentage of the CSR of the private sector and is expected to generate US$100 million a year to finance the targeted Goals. A Green Fund is also being set up to raise US$100 million in the first two years to advance the course of Goal 7 with particular emphasis on using environmentally friendly building materials and developing renewable energy sources for small and medium enterprises.  
Box 3: Young Entrepreneurs’ Roundtable to Promote SDGs 
 
The Eastern and Volta Regional branch of the Association of Ghana Industries (AGI) has launched the Ghana Young Entrepreneurs’ Roundtable (GYER) on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The programme seeks to engage, discuss and facilitate public efforts to achieve measurable outcomes toward the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) to the SDGs in alignment with global development efforts. The initiative is aimed at building a core group of young business leaders to spearhead the integration of SDGs in private sector growth strategies. In addition, the initiative is geared towards heightening the public’s awareness of the relevance of the SDGs and scaling up the drive toward sustaining growth across major sectors of the economy. The GYER intends to leverage the image and support of leading businesses, agencies and personalities to spearhead hubs of community-based activities as incremental steps toward addressing key aspects of the SDGs.  
2.9.2 Youth and the SDGs 
African Youth SDGs Summit  
The Youth Advocates Ghana, Ako Foundation and the 2030 Youth Alliance organise annual African Youth SDGs Summit to collate the view of the youth and mobilise their support for the SDGs. The first Summit, held November 2017 was on the theme “Youth as Drivers of Sustainable Development” and was attended by over 400 delegates from 25 African countries. The Summit discussed issues relating to youth in governance; youth and disability; youth unemployment; food and nutrition security; and justice, peace and security. The second edition was held in November 2018 under the theme “Partnership with Youth to Achieve the SDGs: Moving from Policy to Actions” and focused on SDGs 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 17. The three-day summit, attended by over 1,400 youth from 43 countries, provided a platform for knowledge sharing and called the youth to action on the SDGs. The Summit adopted the Youth Declaration, calling on governments to take urgent action on the SDGs and the private sector to support implementation of the 2030 Agenda.  
Africa Innovates for the SDGs  
In August 2018, the President launched an Africa-wide competition dubbed “Africa Innovates for the SDGs” to identify and reward innovative actions and solutions to SDGs challenges across the continent. The goal of the competition is to support exceptional scalable early-stage innovations that are solving key challenges linked to the SDGs. The competition has drawn over 1,300 applications from all over Africa, showcasing innovations in diverse areas. Final winners will be announced in the second quarter of 2019 and the first five winners will be awarded with a cash prize of USD10,000. In addition to this, the winners, together with all finalists, will be put through incubation hubs to help further develop the innovations for scalability.  
Graphic National Essay Competition  
The Graphic Communications Group Ltd. (GGCL) has been organising annual essay competitions for upper primary and junior high school pupils. In partnership with the SDGs Advisory Unit of the Office of the President and UNICEF, the theme of the 2019 competition is the SDGs. Participants are required to write essays on a number of SDGs-related subjects. Along with improving the pupils’ writing skills, the competition seeks to educate them on the SDGs and how they can contribute to the attainment of the Goals.  
2.9.3 Civil Society Organisations 
After the adoption of the 2030 Agenda, CSOs joined up to form the Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) Platform on SDGs with the aim of providing space for them to coordinate efforts, jointly advocate for change, share information, learn best practices and monitor progress towards achieving the global goals. The Platform presently coordinates over 300 CSO members, which include coalitions, associations, unions, community-based organisations, local, national and international non-governmental organisations (NGOs), as well as religious groups. It has 17 sub-platforms for each of the 17 SDGs and an 18th sub-platform for the youth. Two co-conveners manage each sub-platform and three co-chairs supervise the activities of the platform.  
The national platform serves as the focal point for engagement between CSOs, private sector and government on the SDGs. It has observer status on the High-Level Ministerial Committee on SDGs, and is a member of both the SDGs ICC and the Technical Committee. Since its formation, the platform has provided opportunities for civil society actors to influence and actively participate in SDGs-related activities including the preparation of the SDGs Indicator Baseline Report, the SDGs indicator monitoring framework, participating in the High-Level Political Forum (HLPF) as part of the government delegation, and developing the Data Roadmap for the SDGs and the VNR process.  
Through the Platform’s SDGs localisation initiative, community-based NGOs have been mobilised on district platforms and strengthened to enhance their participation and contribution to the attainment of the SDGs at local level. As part of efforts to increase public awareness of the SDGs, the Platform, in collaboration with government, organised training for media practitioners, which culminated in the establishment of the SDGs Media Network.  
CSOs continue to promote demand-driven accountability in the implementation of the SDGs. This is to ensure that the government does not leave any one behind. To affirm their independence, CSOs have prepared a “shadow report”, which highlights their distinct contributions as well as citizens’ perspectives on the implementation of the SDGs.   
2.9.4 Philanthropy 
Philanthropic foundations, both locally and globally, are integrated into the SDGs processes in Ghana. Foundations continue to provide grants and social financing towards the implementation of the SDGs at various levels. With the goal of improving development outcomes and achieving enduring impact, foundations working with partners have supported the prototyping of innovative solutions for SDGs through the provision of catalytic grants. For example, the SDG Philanthropy Platform (SDGPP), coordinated by UNDP, and working with Conrad N. Hilton Foundation and Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors, has provided catalytic grants to social enterprises and NGOs for innovative, scalable, and impactful solutions to bringing safe water to communities classified as “hard-to-reach.”  
In addition, the Newmont Ahafo Development Foundation has constructed 110 projects in the education, health, water and sanitation, and energy work streams, at a cost of about US$4.5 million. MTN Ghana Foundation has built health and educational facilities in some deprived communities, as well as providing 100 scholarships each year for bright but needy students. There are many such examples of interventions which accelerate achieving the SDGs with contributions of philanthropy.  
To help deepen philanthropic engagement on the SDGs, the SDG Philanthropy Platform has conducted research which provides progressive policy options for optimal government-philanthropy collaborative models. Additionally, the SDGs ecosystem mapping by the Platform has been uploaded to a portal which helps foundations to identify entry points for collaborative pathways in the SDGs. The establishment of Philanthropy and Impact Investment Networks Ghana (PHIING) by SDGPP and its partners has deepened partnerships among foundations in providing grants and innovative financing to social enterprises that are incubating innovative pilot projects with potential for scaling up. 
2.9.5 Traditional Authorities  
Within the framework of the “whole of society” approach to the implementation of the SDGs, Ghana has taken advantage of the unique role of chieftaincy institutions to promote the national development agenda. Chieftaincy is one of the oldest and most highly revered institutions in Ghana. Traditional leaders serve as agents of development due to their ability to mobilise people and resources for development projects such as health facilities, police stations, and schools. Since the adoption of the SDGs, several traditional leaders have initiated programmes and projects in support of government efforts to attain the SDGs. Two such initiatives are the Royal Dialogue on the SDGs and the Assin Kushea Sanitation Initiative.  
Royal Dialogue 
A Royal Dialogue was held on the SDGs at Manhyia Palace in Kumasi under the patronage of the Asantehene, Otumfuo Osei Tutu II, who engaged business leaders and selected eminent personalities to brainstorm on key imperatives for achieving the 2030 Agenda. This led to the Kumasi Declaration which outlined how government will partner with traditional and religious leaders, civil society organisations, the youth, and the private sector, to attain the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.  
Assin Kushea Sanitation Initiative 
To help attain SDG 6, the Paramount Chief of Assin Kushea, Ehunabobrim Prah Agyensaim VI initiated a sanitation policy to ensure his town was the cleanest in the region for emulation by others. Large waste bins were provided along streets and households by the Chief to keep the township clean. Those found littering were summoned to the palace and fined. This has led to positive attitudinal change and improved general sanitation in the Kushea traditional area.  
2.9.6 Research and academia 
Based on work done by Nakamura et al., 2019, Ghana was identified as one of the most productive nations on SDGs-related research during the period 2015-2018. Most public and private universities, as well as government-funded research institutions, have active research programmes that are linked directly with the SDGs or with related concepts. Areas of research priorities relative to the SDGs included: maternal, newborn, and child morbidity and mortality; water supply and sanitation; and household fuel use and emissions.  The University of Ghana self-assessment report on research response to the SDGs showed that most doctoral research focused on SDG 2 (Zero hunger), SDG 3 (Good health and well-being) and SDG 6 (Water and sanitation).  
In addition, the research community is collaborating with traditional authorities and supporting their SDGs initiatives such as the Kumasi Declaration on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in honour of Busumuru Kofi Annan, which emanated from the Royal Dialogue on the SDGs held under the patronage of Otumfuo Osei Tutu II. Over the period of implementation of the SDGs, government will continue to strengthen its partnership with the research community to co-develop and co-design research that will be of benefit to the people of Ghana and the achievement of the SDGs by 2030. 
2.9.7 United Nations Agencies 
The United Nations system has been operating in Ghana since the 1960s.  Currently there are 26 agencies providing the country with technical assistance for sustainable economic, social, environmental and institutional development. The agencies work with government, civil society organisations, and the private sector to address critical development challenges through capacity development, strengthening of accountability systems and the delivery of quality social services, with a focus on the most deprived and vulnerable populations. In June 2018, the Government of Ghana and the United Nations in Ghana jointly signed the UN Sustainable Development Partnership 2018-2022 (UNSDP), a five-year strategic framework that sets out the collective vision and response of the UN system to national development priorities. A number of UN agencies have partnered with government to carry out SDGs-related activities, including media training, awareness creation and consultative meetings. 
2.9.8 Development Partners 
There are several multilateral and bilateral agencies operating in various sectors and at various levels in Ghana. They provide financial and technical support to a wide range of stakeholders to contribute towards improving the welfare and well-being of Ghanaians. Some of the areas of collaboration between are: education, peace and security, trade, sports, health and governance. 
2.9.9 Volunteers 
Volunteering is one of the most entrenched forms of social engagement in Ghanaian society. Individuals, schools, businesses, churches, mosques and youth groups undertake voluntary activities based on a commitment support to less privileged persons or communities. There are also a number of international volunteering groups actively working in Ghana, on a wide range of initiatives geared towards achieving the SDGs. Most of the volunteering activities in Ghana are in the areas of teaching, construction, healthcare, conservation and skills development, mostly in deprived communities. 
2.10 Communications and Awareness Creation  
Ghana considers public awareness and knowledge as an integral part of the SDGs implementation, and has developed a comprehensive communication strategy to improve knowledge among key stakeholders and galvanise support for the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs. The communications strategy prescribes actions and tools needed to educate and inform target audiences on the goals. The strategy uses social media platforms, SDGs-branded souvenirs, radio and television programmes, community dialogues and collective action to engage with stakeholders. It focuses on developing popular campaigns to inform, inspire and involve everyone on the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs.   
The target audiences for Ghana’s SDGs communications strategy include MDAs, -MMDAs, traditional authorities, academia, private sector, media, schoolchildren, youth, farmers, drivers, fisher folk, head porters (kayayei), civil society, educational institutions, faith-based organisations, marginalised groups and the general public. 
Awareness creation campaigns have been conducted in four regional capitals focusing on market women, schoolchildren, fisher folk, street children, marginalised groups, and farmer groups. Currently, efforts are being made to translate the SDGs into local dialects, braille, local proverbs and adinkra symbols for ease of communication and understanding by target audiences. 
Given the critical role the media play in bringing about paradigm shifts, the strategy assigns special roles to the media to champion the implementation of the SDGs. Specifically, they are envisaged to inform, educate and provide platforms for public debate and discussions. Media SDGs platforms have been created to facilitate information sharing and discussions on the goals at national, regional and district level. Training sessions have been conducted at national level and in four regional capitals for the media on the SDGs and how they can effectively report on the SDGs.   
To reach rural communities, the Ghana Community Radio Network (GCRN) has launched a project known as “Participatory Community Radio and the Right to Communicate - A Singular Pathway to the SDGs, (CR-SDGs).” The project focuses on training community radio personnel, advocacy, social mobilisation, and behavioural change for the attainment of the SDGs especially in rural communities. 

METHODOLOGY AND PROCESS FOR PREPARATION OF THE VOLUNTARY NATIONAL REVIEW REPORT 
	3.1 	Introduction  
The Voluntary National Review (VNR) process was used as an opportunity to review Ghana’s progress towards the 2030 Agenda, as well as foster national ownership, build awareness and encourage the involvement of key stakeholders. The VNR process was inclusive and participatory with the participation of a wide range of stakeholders at the national and sub-national levels. The stakeholders included parliamentarians, civil society organisations, the private sector, school children, traditional authorities and academia. The VNR process was coordinated by the SDGs Implementation Coordinating Committee (ICC) under the supervision of the High Level Ministerial Committee on SDGs.  
Ghana’s VNR process had three main components, namely: 
i. the policy and regulatory environment for implementing the SDGs; 
ii. progress of implementation of the 17 goals; 
iii. three cross-cutting themes – Youth engagement in the SDGs; Leave no one behind and Synergies across the goals. 
 
3.2 Ghana’s VNR Roadmap 
 
 
3.3 Expert Team  
A team of local experts was constituted to support data collection, analysis and drafting of background technical papers for the VNR report. They comprised experts in youth issues, governance, economics, an economist, a research science, and a social science. The team worked under the technical direction of the ICC.

	3.4 	Launch of the VNR Report 
To ensure ownership and participation, the VNR process was officially launched by the Minister for Planning and - Chairman of the HLMC. The launch was followed by series of radio and television interviews to further inform the general public about the process, their expected role and encourage their active participation.  
	3.5 	Consultative Meetings 
Thematic consultations on Youth Engagement on the SDGs, Leaving No One Behind and Synergies among the goals were organized in Cape Coast, Tamale and Kumasi respectively. Each consultative meeting, in the spirit of leaving no one behind brought together over 100 participants from government agencies, civil society organisations, the private sector, academia, traditional authorities, persons with disability, political parties, youth groups and marginalised groups. Inputs were collated from 
stakeholders on the various themes prior to the A school child living with hearing impairment doing consultative meetings, while consultants conducted a a presentation at the consultative meeting in Tamale review of the cross-cutting themes. The submission on “Leaving no one behind.”  from stakeholders and the consultants’ reports formed the basis of discussion at the consultative meetings.  
At the meetings, participants identified critical barriers, opportunities, emerging issues under each thematic area, and recommended actions to respond to the identified issues. The outputs from the thematic consultations are reflected in the VNR report. Full reports on the thematic reviews will be published separately to inform strategic interventions for accelerating the implementation of the SDGs at all levels.  
	3.6 	Data Collection and Report Drafting 
The ICC compiled a list of indicators for the VNR in consultation with (MDAs) with inputs from the CSOs platform on SDGs and the United Nations Agencies in Ghana. These included SDGs indicators and other complimentary indicators available from Ghana’s statistical system. A data collection template was developed and distributed to MDAs to collect relevant information on the indicators. Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) compiled the meta-data for all the indicators, provided training for the MDAs and supported them to compute the indicator values.  The indicator values were then validated for use in the VNR report. 
In addition to quantitative information on the indicators, cases of innovative SDGs related interventions were collected from MDAs, MMDAs, CSOs, development partners, traditional authorities and the private sector. Thirty three cases were submitted, reviewed with some selected to illustrate good practices and success stories under each of the goals for inclusion in the VNR report. The cases collected will be uploaded to an on-line portal which is under development to facilitate information and experience sharing on SDGs activities, as well as foster collaborations and partnerships.  
Draft technical reports on the principles of leaving no one behind, youth engagement on the SDGs and synergies among the goals and policy coherence were prepared by the technical experts.  
	3.7 	Awareness Creation  
Ghana leveraged on the VNR process to increase public awareness and knowledge on the SDGs. A four-day campaign was carried out concurrently in the cities of Cape Coast, Kumasi and Tamale to engage with selected stakeholders and mobilise support for the implementation of the SDGs. The target stakeholders for the campaign were: 
i. News editor and reporters; 
ii. Primary school children; 
iii. Secondary school children; 
iv. Street children; 
v. Market women; 
vi. Head potters  
vii. Fisher folks; and  
viii. Farmer groups. 
 
Radio interviews were granted on local radio stations to inform the general public on the SDGs, the implementation arrangements and how they could contribute to the implementation. The public education and awareness campaign was conducted jointly by the ICC, the CSOs Platform on SDGs, UNDP, UNICEF and WFP.  
 
	3.8 	Review and Validation Process 
3.8.1 National Level  
The technical experts prepared draft reports on the cross-cutting themes and the progress on implementation of the 17 SDGs based on an agreed list of indicators. The draft reports were reviewed by both state and non-state stakeholders in a series of targeted review meetings. Discussions of emerging information from the stakeholders in the targeted review meetings provided a basis for checking the data, identifying innovative stories and cases, as well as recommendations for the way forward. The draft reports were updated based on comments from the meetings.  
A team from the ICC produced a harmonised VNR report by synthesising information from the updated draft reports prepared by the consultants and additional information from stakeholders. The report was validated and endorsed by stakeholders at a series of workshops. The target stakeholders for the validation meetings are shown in table 3.1.

To ensure grass root participation in the validation process, government explored existing institutional architecture to solicit inputs into the report. As part of the NAPRM-GC arrangement, sub-national structures for citizen’s involvement in formulation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of government policies has been instituted. In order not to duplicate effort and to take advantage of the existing arrangement, government partnered NAPRM-GC to validate the VNR using the district oversight committees.  
	3.9 	Launch and Dissemination of VNR Report 
On completion and endorsement of the report by the HLMC, the document will be submitted to the UN-DESA, and formally launched in Accra, ahead of the HLPF in July 2019. The launch will provide an opportunity to share findings of the VNR with key stakeholders, and kick-start a nationwide dissemination exercise. Awareness creation activities and training for targeted groups on the SDGs will be incorporated into the dissemination exercise. An abridged version of the report and flyers will also be printed for distribution.  
 

PROGRESS ON GOALS AND TARGETS 
END POVERTY IN ALL ITS FORMS EVERYWHERE 
 Indicator 1.1.1: Proportion of population below the international poverty line, by sex, age, employment status and geographical location (urban/rural). 
The proportion of Ghanaians living below the international poverty line declined from 13.6 percent in 2013 to 11.9 percent in 2017. The trend is 
reflected in both urban and rural areas over the same period. Two of the ten regions (Upper East and Northern) recorded increases in overall poverty from 31 percent to 40 percent and 36 percent to 39.3 percent respectively.

The proportion of Ghanaians who are classified as poor based on national definition reduced from 24.2 percent in 2013 to 23.4 percent in 2017. More males than females live in households that are deemed to be at risk of poverty. Irrespective of the ecological zone, the incidence of poverty is higher among the rural population. The increase in poverty in the rural areas is due in part to the increase in the proportion of poor households in the rural savannah zone which was estimated at 64 percent in 2017 compared to 55 percent in 2013. Regional disaggregation shows that between 2013 and 2017 poverty increased in Volta, Northern, Upper West and Upper East regions, after a general decline from 2005.

Indicator 1.2.2: Proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definition 
In Ghana, 73.4 percent of children are estimated to be multidimensionally poor as a result of being simultaneously deprived in at least three of the children’s well-being measures – nutrition; health; learning and development; child protection; water; sanitation; housing; and information. There are more multidimensionally poor children in rural than urban areas. Also, the incidence is highest (above 80 percent) in the Northern, Upper East, Upper West and Volta regions (Figure 4.1.6). In general, few significant gender differences exist. For the dimension of learning and development, there is a higher proportion of deprived boys than girls in the 12-14 year age group (49 percent versus 42.6 percent). A higher education level of the mother or household head is associated with lower multidimensional poverty rates across all age groups. For the non-poor children, 2.5 percent have no deprivations while 8.3 percent are deprive in one of the well-being measures.  
Reducing multidimensional poverty in Ghana requires: adopting a multi-sectoral approach; and ensuring efficient investment in interventions targeting children, especially the youngest ones (04 years old), considering their degree of deprivations.  
 
At the national level, 28.2 percent of children are monetary poor with a much higher prevalence in rural (44.5 percent) than urban areas (9.8 percent). Regional disaggregation shows a higher proportion of monetary poor children in the Upper West (77.7 percent), Northern (67.4 percent) and Upper East (58.1 percent) regions. Greater Accra region reports the lowest proportion of monetary poor children (3.6 percent).

Indicator 1.a.1: Proportion of domestically generated resources allocated by the government directly to poverty reduction programmes 
Government spending on poverty reduction is Figure 4.1.7: Total poverty reduction allocation as a mainly through MDAs and MMDAs and percentage of total budget (allocation and disbursed), focuses on social protection, provision of basic 2015-2017 (%) education, primary health care, poverty-focused agriculture, rural water, feeder roads and rural electrification.  
About 20 percent of annual budget from 2015 to 2017 was allocated to poverty reduction related programmes. However, the average actual disbursement within the same period was more than allocated and constituted about 25 percent of annual budget (Figure 4.1.7). The bulk of the poverty expenditure goes to basic education (55.6 percent) and primary healthcare (19.3 percent) and agriculture (2.5 percent). The feeder roads sector received the least (0.31 percent). Source: MoF, Budget Statement and Economic Policy of 
 	Government, 2018 
Indicator 1.a.2: Proportion of total government spending on essential services (education, health and social protection) 
Total government spending on education and health improved between 2016 and 2017 after recording a decline from 2015. Spending on education continues to constitute the largest single expenditure item of the national budget statement (17 percent) (Figure 4.1.8).

END HUNGER, ACHIEVE FOOD SECURITY AND IMPROVED 
NUTRITION AND PROMOTE SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE 
Indicator 2.2.1: Prevalence of stunting (height for age <-2 standard deviation from the median of the World Health Organization (WHO) Child Growth Standards) among children under 5 years of age 
Figure 4.2.1: National prevalence of stunting among Ghana has made some progress in improving the children under 5 years of age, 1998 to 2017 (%) nutritional status of children, particularly those under 
 5 years of age. According to the Multiple Indicator 35 Cluster Survey (MICS, 2011), stunting among children 
30 5 years and younger decreased from 30 percent in 1998 to 23 percent in 2011. This further declined from 19 25 percent in 2014 to 18 percent in 2017 (Figure 4.2.1). 
20 The projected prevalence of stunted children in the case of Ghana, would mean a constant reduction of 0.9 
15 percentage points annually in the stunting rate from 30 percent (estimate for 1998) to 11 percent in 2030.  
Strong regional variations exist with the prevalence of stunting. The incidence of stunting is highest in the northern region at 29.0 percent and lowest in the Greater Accra region at 13.0 percent (Figure 4.2.2). 
Source: GSS, MICS 2017 Hunger and malnutrition persist in some parts of the country. This is especially true for the Northern, Upper East and Volta, in addition to many rural and peri-urban communities throughout the country due to the unsustainable food production systems in the country.

The prevalence rate for overweight children is witnessing a steady decline. This reduced from 7.1 percent in 2003 to 4.7 percent in 2011 and further to 1 percent in 2017. The prevalence rate of underweight also declined from 22.1 percent in 2003 to 14.3 percent in 2011. This trend stabilized at 13 percent from 2011 to 2017. Wasting however increased from 6 percent in 2011 to 7 percent in 2017

• Reviewing and scaling up the Regenerative Health and Nutrition Programme (RHNP); eliminating child and adult obesity; and promoting research and development in Food and Nutrition Security (FNS).    
Other interventions in the agricultural sector include: Planting for Food and Jobs (to stimulate food production and generate incomes); One village, one dam (to ensure all year-round farming especially in the northern part of the country); One district, one factory (to establish at least one industrial enterprise in each district; and subsidy programmes on retail prices of seeds and fertilizers). The Ghana Zero Hunger Strategic Review supports the home vegetable gardens component of the Planting for Food and Jobs initiative as an intervention to promote food and nutrition security.

Foreign direct investment to the agricultural sector is very low and except for some few years, has not gone beyond one percent of the total FDI flows into the country. It increased from 0.27 percent in 2012 to 3.88 percent in 
2013, after which it witnessed a decline of Source: GIPC, 2018

Key interventions to improve investment to the Agriculture sector include:  
• Exemptions on import duties on imported agricultural inputs;  
• Introduction of attractive tax holidays to serve as incentives for enterprises engaged in agriculture production and processing;  
• Implementation of corporate tax rebate for agro-processing companies located in regional capitals and local communities;  
• Implementation of free transferability of capital, profits and dividends; and 
• Introduction of automatic immigrant quotas such as work and resident permits.
HEALTHY LIVES AND PROMOTE WELL-BEING FOR ALL AT ALL AGES 
Indicator 3.1.1: Maternal mortality ratio  
The indicator on maternal mortality is measured with both survey and institutional data. Data from maternal health survey indicates that maternal deaths have 
declined from 580 per 100,000 live births in 2007 to 310 per 100,000 live births in 2017 (Figure 4.3.1).  This is consistent with trends using institutional data which shows a decline from 224 per 100,000 live births in 2007 to 147 per 100,000 live births in 2017 (Figure 4.3.2). In 2017, 97 percent of pregnant women visited a skilled health personnel for antenatal care at least once, 85 percent at least four times and 26 percent at least eight times. 
Regional disaggregation of institutional maternal mortality shows that maternal deaths worsened  in  2017 in Ashanti, Eastern, Greater Accra and Upper East regions but improved in the other six regions with Brong Ahafo, Upper West, Central and Western regions attaining the medium-term target of less than 135 per 100,000 live births. 
The Government of Ghana is committed to reducing maternal deaths by making reproductive health services available to all women of childbearing age. For instance, the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) was reviewed in 2016 to provide universal guarantee package of maternal and child healthcare. The possession of the NHIS card is no longer necessary to access primary healthcare for pregnant women. 
Figure 4.3.1: Maternal mortality ratio - Figure 4.3.2: Institutional maternal mortality, 2007-2017 (per 100,000 live survey, 2007 & 2017 (per 100,000 live births)

 Key issues relating to reducing maternal mortality include addressing concerns on adolescence fertility and improving coverage of family planning services. Young mothers are at increased risk of sickness and death and are more likely to experience adverse pregnancy outcomes.  They are also more likely to be constrained in their ability to pursue educational opportunities than young women who delay childbearing. Intermittent Preventive Treatment (IPT) for malaria and HIV counselling is being promoted upscaled to cover all pregnant women. 
 
 
 
Indicator 3.1.2: Proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel 
The percentage of deliveries attended by health personnel trained in providing lifesaving obstetric care, including giving the necessary supervision, care and advice to women during pregnancy continue to improve with an increase from 73.7 percent in 2014 to 79.9 percent in 2017 (Figure 4.3.3). With the exception of Ashanti Region which recorded a decline – from 86 percent to 82 percent – all the other regions improved. Mothers with higher levels of education and income are more likely to be supervised by skilled health providers (Figure 4.3.4).  

2017 	Source: GSS, GDHS 2014; MICS 2017 
Measures to increase coverage of supervised delivery have focused on: producing and equitably distributing midwives; enhancing access to CHPS compound in deprived areas; improving access to obstetric emergency services; training on the use of partograph which promotes confidence, reducing prolonged labour, caesarean sections and intra-partum stillbirths; and training of health workers including midwives in safe motherhood skills, abortion care, lactation management, and Jadelle insertion and removal. 
Indicator 3.2.1: Under-five mortality rate 
Since 2003, the likelihood of a child dying before reaching age 5 has been declining in Ghana reaching 56 per 1000 live births in 2017 (Figure 4.3.5) . Similar trend was observed across all regions and socio-economic characteristics – sex, urban and rural areas (Figure 4.3.6). 
Child health interventions contributing to the improvement in under five mortality rate include: implementing the Child Health Policy and Child Health Strategy; sustaining the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) for children; enhancing the use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs); improving malaria case management in health facilities; and scaling up the Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI) programme.

Indicator 3.2.2 Neonatal mortality rate 
 The number of children dying within 28 days of birth has declined from 43 per 1, 000 live births in 2003 to 27 deaths per 1, 000 live births in 2017 (Figure 4.3.7).  Between 2014 and 2017, all regions recorded similar declines except Ashanti, which recorded an increase from 42 deaths per 1, 000 live births in 2014 to   52 deaths per 1, 000 live births in 2017 (Figure 4.3.8). In 2014, the highest mortality rates occurred among children of women in the highest wealth quintile and highest education attainment, while in 2017 the highest mortality occurred among children of women in the lowest quintile and lowest education. 

 
Indicator 3.3.1: Number of new HIV infections per 1,000 uninfected population, by sex, age and key populations 
The 2017 sentinel report estimates HIV prevalence rate in Ghana as 1.67 percent, representing a decline from 1.70 percent recorded in 2016. The number of estimated new HIV and AIDS infections has not recorded significant reduction from 2013 to 2017. Indeed, new infections increased from 2013 to 2015 but declined from 19.57 in 2015 to 19.1 in 2017 (Figure 4.3.9).  
Greater Accra and Ashanti Regions have the highest number of HIV population for all age groups while Upper East and Upper West have the lowest. Moreover, Greater Accra and Ashanti regions have the highest new HIV infections whilst Upper West has the least. For all regions, new infected persons were mostly females (Figure 4.3.10).

Prevention of mother-to-child transmission and coverage of pediatric antiretroviral therapy remain low as stigma and discrimination continue to hamper uptake of services. In 2016, Ghana adopted the “Treat-All” policy which makes every People Living with HIV (PLHIV) eligible for treatment and this is expected to increase PLHIV on Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ARV).  To accelerate action towards ending HIV and AIDs epidemic, government adopted a 90-90-90 strategy in 2017 which is aimed at ensuring that by 2020 all 90 percent of PLHIV will know their status, 90 percent of all people with diagnosed HIV infection will receive sustained ART and 90 percent of all receiving ART will have viral suppression. 
Indicator 3.3.2: Tuberculosis incidence per 100,000 population 
Tuberculosis incidence is measured with total case notifications in a year per 100,000 population. The incidence rate declined from 49.38 per 100,000 population in 2016 to 46.34 per 100,000 population in 2018 (Figure 4.3.11).  
Progress towards TB control is monitored by the TB Treatment Success Rate, which is the percentage of all registered new tuberculosis cases in a given year that successfully completed treatment. Ghana 
has achieved the international target of having Figure 4.3.11: Tuberculosis incidence, 2016-2018 (per
TB treatment success rate of 85%. However, 1,000,000 Population the treatment success rate has remained almost stagnant over the years 
To sustain the gains made, the National TB Control programme is implementing various strategies including the Directly Observed Treatment Short-course (DOTS) across the 5 tier health system of Ghana. The DOT programme involves ensuring regular drugs supply, building capacity for TB treatment, and directly supervising treatment among others. By WHO definition Ghana has achieved 100 percent DOT coverage and is currently in the maintenance stage of DOT expansion. 
Indicator 3.3.3: Malaria incidence per 1,000 population 
The malaria incidence declined from 2015 to 2016 but has been increasing since then, reaching  185.4 cases per 1000 population in 2018 Figure 4.3.12: Malaria Incidence rate, 2015-2018 (per 1000
(Figure 4.3.12). A total of 11,027,087 population) uncomplicated suspected malaria cases were reported in 2018, out of which 92 percent were tested. About 54 percent of the cases tested were confirmed either through microscopy or rapid diagnostic test. The use of insecticidetreated nets (ITNs) is being promoted to help reduce the incidence of malaria among high risk groups.

Indicator 3.7.2: Adolescent birth rate (aged 10-14 years; aged 15-19 years) per 1,000 women in that age group 
Adolescent birth rate has declined from 76 percent in 2014 to 75 percent in 2017(Figure: 4.3.15).  In reaping the demographic dividend for national development, efforts are in place to coordinate the implementation of the Ghana Family Planning Costed Implementation Plan, 2016-2020 and awareness creation intervention. 
Figure 4.3.15: Adolescent Birth Rate, 1993 to 2017 (%) Government’s strategy is to expand access to and improve the quality of healthcare for all socioeconomic groups through a Universal Health Coverage (UHC) policy. Investments have been made in quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient health infrastructure, such as expansion of Community-Based 	Health 	Planning 	Services (CHPS) compounds, upgrade of existing hospital facilities 	and 	construction 	of 	new 	health infrastructure.  
Efforts to achieve the goal of the UHC policy 
Source: GHS, GDHS Various Years and MICS 2017 include bridging equity gaps in access to healthcare; ensuring sustainable healthcare financing arrangements that protect the poor; and improving governance, management and efficiency in health service delivery. Others were improving access to quality service delivery and quality mental health services; improving maternal, child and adolescent healthcare; and preventing and controlling non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). 
Despite these interventions, access to health services has generally declined especially in rural areas of the country (Ghana Living Standards Survey Round 7). Huge imbalances in geographical access to quality healthcare; inadequate and inequitable distribution of critical staff, increased cost of healthcare delivery, and poor quality of healthcare services prevail.

While Ghana has been able to provide access to education for the majority of children, quality of education is lagging behind. Poor learning outcomes are evidenced by proficiency in learning and pass rates. Primary school pupils continue to be challenged in both English and Mathematics in 2016. Performance was noticeably lower for Mathematics than for English, with only 22 percent of P4 pupils and 25 percent of P6 pupils achieving proficiency in Mathematics compared to 37 percent of P4 pupils and 38 percent of P6 pupils achieving proficiency in English.  Less than half of pupils in both P4 and P6 achieved minimum competency in both English and Mathematics. Girls are more proficient than boys in English in P6 while the reverse is the case in mathematics. However, in P4, both boys and girls are at par in mathematics with girls having higher proficiency in English than boys (Table 4.4.1)

Indicator 4.2.1: Proportion of children under 5 years of age who are developmentally on track in health, learning and psychosocial well-being, by sex 
Effective early childhood development is directly linked to improved adult health, educational attainment and productivity to build human capital and promote sustainable development. Early childhood development of children under 5 years has worsened from an index score of 73.7 percent in 2011 to 68.4 percent in 2017. The situation was mostly noticeable among girls than boys (Figure 4.4.3). 
Government’s agenda for education over the medium-term includes prioritisation of kindergarten education as a strategy for addressing quality education challenges from the foundation level.

Over the years, non-formal education in Ghana has been confronted with sporadic supervision of teaching and learning, lack of essential teaching and learning materials and inadequate financial resources to support teaching and learning. 
A number of initiatives have been proposed in the draft Non-Formal Agency Bill which is under review. These include Complementary Basic Education (CBE), Community Learning Centres (CLC), Literacy for Kayayei4 and other street children, and Tree Farms for Afforestation and Wealth Creation. Non-Formal Education Division (NFED) has collaborated with National Council for Curriculum Assessment (NaCCA) to review the Basic English Literacy Materials - Primers 1 and 2 and the Facilitator’s Manual. 
Tables 4.4.6 and 4.4.7 below provide enrolment Figures under the National Functional Literacy programme and Basic English Literacy. In all years, enrolment in these programmes have been dominated by females.

Indicator 4.5.1: Parity indices (female/male, rural/urban, bottom/top wealth quintile and others such as disability status, indigenous peoples and conflict-affected, as data become available) for all education indicators on this list that can be disaggregated 
 Data from 2011 and 2017 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey indicate that gender parity has been generally achieved at both primary and secondary level (Table 4.4.9). Gender parity at the primary level was achieved in 2011 and increased to 1.03 in 2017. While at the secondary level, it decreased from 1.1 to 0.97 during the same period. Also, wealth parity shows equal access to education for both the rich and poor in 2011, but the poor was highly disadvantaged especially at secondary level in 2017. In terms of geographical areas, access to education has declined significantly for rural households especially at the secondary level.

                                             districts from 0.93 in 2016/17 to 0.89 in 2017/18. 
Enrolment rates 
Gross and net enrolment rates have generally improved in Ghana since 2013/2014 academic year. With the exception of KG, gross enrolment rates increased across all levels between 2013 and 2017. Also, net enrolment increased at all levels over the same period except at KG level. At the KG level gross enrolment and net enrolment declined by 7.4 and 16.4 percentage points respectively. These have been attributed largely to late enrolment as well as the number of children repeating grades. 
Enrolment at the SHS level has recorded significant improvement especially in 2017/2018 on account of the introduction of government’s free SHS flagship programme. Due to the programme, about 90,000 additional students were enrolled in 2017/2018 academic year. The current challenges facing secondary education is inadequate infrastructure to accommodate all the additional students. As an interim measure, government introduced a double track system to manage overcrowding.

Completion rates 
 Completion rate remains high at the primary level but lower at the JHS and SHS levels. On average, completion rate is about 100.4 percent at the primary level during the period 2013 to 2018, compared to 75.9 percent and 44.5 percent at the JHS and SHS levels respectively (Figure 4.4.5). 
In response to this challenge, government is implementing a number of interventions including increment in capitation grant by 100 percent; Secondary Education Improvement Project; provision of added subsidy to day students; provision of core textbooks to students in public senior high schools; provision of one hot meal to day students; implementation of Free Senior High School Policy; and implementation of girls participatory approach to students success.

GHANA’S FREE SHS PROGRAMME 
The government of Ghana in the 2017/2018 academic year, commenced the implementation of the Free Senior High School (SHS) policy with the objective to ensure at least every teenager in the country is supported to have access to free quality education to senior high level. The policy is anchored on the following pillars: removal of cost barriers through the absorption of fees approved by the GES council; expansion of physical school infrastructure and facilities to accommodate the expected increase in enrolment; improving quality through provision of core text books and supplementary readers, teacher rationalisation and deployment; and improving competitiveness of Ghanaian Students to match the best in the World.   
Graphic Online: 13 September, 2018 – Launch of Free SHS 
Programme 
 
In the light of this the government under the current Education Strategic Plan seeks to ensure that no qualified student is denied access to senior secondary education which in effect completely satisfies the implementation of SDG 4.1.  Available statistics showed that between 2013 and 2016 about 100,000 students who were placed annually were unable to enrol due to financial challenges with most of them coming from low income families. For the 2017/18 academic year, this number reduced to about 62,000 largely as a result of the implementation of the free SHS policy. Also, the percentage of students in each cohort enrolling over the period 2013-2016 was about 74%. This however increased to 85% in the 2017/18 academic year. Gender parity has nearly been achieved and reached 0.96 in 2016/17. Evidently, this policy satisfies the “Leave no one behind” principle of the 2030 Agenda. 
 
ACHIEVE GENDER EQUITY AND EMPOWER ALL WOMEN AND GIRLS 
Indicator 5.2.1: Proportion of ever-partnered women and girls aged 15 years and older subjected to physical, sexual or psychological violence by a current or former intimate partner in the previous 12 months, by form of violence and by 
age 
Psychological violence has the highest incidence among everpartnered women in Ghana particularly among divorced, separated or widowed women.  Available data from GLSS 6 indicate that 24.8 percent of divorced, 	separated 	or widowed women suffered from psychological 	violence compared with 21.3 percent in the 	category 	married/living together (Figure 4.5.1).  
 
 
 
Indicator 5.3.1: Proportion of women aged 20-24 years who were married or in a union before age 15 and before age 18 
Ghana has made considerable progress in addressing early child marriages. The proportion of children who marry before age 15 and 18 has 
Figure 4.5.2: Proportion of women aged 20-24 who married 
fallen significantly between 2006 and 2017. before age 15 and 18, 2006, 2013, 2017 (%) 
While the proportion of girls who married before age 15 has declined from 1.1 percent in 2006 to 0.4 percent in 2017, the proportion of those who married before age 18 has also fallen from 12 percent to 8.1 percent during the same period (Figure 4.5.2). Early child marriage is reported to be most prevalent in Upper West (1.3 percent), Northern (1.2 percent) and Volta (1.1 percent) regions, however Ashanti, Brong Ahafo and Western regions recorded no early marriages before age 15. 
To completely curb this problem, Source: GSS, GLSS 5(1998/99), 6(2012/13) and 7(2016/17) government has adopted a comprehensive 
national framework for ending child marriage. The framework prioritises: the establishment of an advisory committee on ending child marriage; setting up a network of stakeholders for experience sharing; and undertaking public sensitisation through the use of popular Ghanaian personalities as goodwill ambassadors. 
Indicator 5.4.1: Proportion of time spent on unpaid domestic and care work, by sex, age and location 
On average, Ghanaians spend 42.8 minutes a day on domestic and care work such as collecting firewood, fetching water, washing and ironing clothes, cooking and cleaning, caring for children, elderly, and the sick among others. Female unpaid domestic and care workers spend an average of 51.6 minutes a day compared to males, who spend 33.2 minutes on average. On the other hand, unpaid domestic and care workers in urban areas spend 47.1 minutes per day compared to 40 minutes in the rural areas. Youth between the ages of 15 and 24 spend the most time on unpaid domestic and care work (Figure 4.5.3). 
Figure 4.5.3: Average time spent on unpaid domestic and care work, 2013 (minutes) 

 
Indicator 5.5.1: Proportion of seats held by women in (a) national parliaments and (b) local governments 
Women constitute about 51.2 percent of the population of Ghana. Without their effective participation in political governance and decision-making process, the development effort will remain unbalanced. The proportion of women with seats in Parliament has been very low since the inception of the Fourth Republic, the highest being 13.4 percent in 2017 (Figure 4.5.4).  The proportion of women appointed as chief executives of local governments (MMDCEs) has increased from 10.3 percent in 2016 to 14.8 percent in 2018. The proportion of women elected as members of local governments declined from 11 percent in 2009 to 5 percent in 2017. The proportion of female ministers in government increased from 23.3 percent in 2016 to 25 percent in 2017. However, the proportion of female Deputy Ministers decreased from 20.9 percent in 2016 to 16 percent in 2017.

Ghana has shown commitment in ensuring gender equality and equity in political, social and economic development. Legislative framework and institutional architecture to promote gender equality are in place, including a gender policy, and establishment of a Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection. The Ministry is supported by gender desks in other sector ministries, departments and agencies to mainstream gender issues in their sector plans and programmes. Ghana has also adopted several of the international gender conventions/treaties in its legal framework, and has made high-profile appointments of women, including Chief Justices, Chairpersons of the Electoral Commission and a Chief of Staff. To address the underlying structural barriers to women and girls’ economic empowerment, government is taking steps to pass into law the Affirmative Action Bill; and ensure gender balance on all Government-appointed committees, boards and other official bodies.  
 

ENSURE AVAILABILITY AND SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT OF 
WATER AND SANITATION FOR ALL 
Indicator 6.1.1: Proportion of population using safely managed drinking water services 
Data from Ghana Living Standard surveys show that the proportion of population using improved drinking water services including piped water into dwelling, yard or plot, bottled water and sachet water which is available when needed increased from 37.3 percent in 2013 to 44.3 percent in 2017 (Figure 4.6.1). Though the urban population has more access than the rural, the percentage increase in access to improved water over the period (2013-2017) has been higher in rural areas (Figure 4.6.2).    
On the other hand, the 2017/2018 MICS, which factored in the measurement of faecal contamination, showed that only 19 percent of the population has access to safely managed water services.

Community-Led Total Sanitation Programme 
The CLTS is an effective tool for curbing Open Defecation in the country particularly in northern Ghana. Communities are facilitated to conduct their own appraisal and analysis of open defecation and take their own action to become open defecation free. This serves as a means of accelerating the population’s access and use of basic sanitation. The introduction of the CLTS programme which was piloted in five Districts in the Upper East Region including the Bongo, Bawku, Garu, Kassena-Nankana West and Builsa Districts in the region in 2010 with support from UNICEF had yielded positive impact in terms of health needs. Out of the 333 communities that were selected from the five Districts for piloting, 212 had stopped practicing open defecation and had constructed their own toilets using local materials hence reducing diseases such as typhoid, and diarrhoea among others.  
 
In Ghana, improving access to adequate sanitation facilities is a priority. About 20 percent of the entire country’s population practice open defecation. The practice is more widespread in the three regions of northern Ghana where more than 70 percent of the population practice open defecation.   
The Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development (MLGRD) is implementing a National 
and Action Plan (NESSAP) together with a Strategic Environmental Sanitation Investment Plan (SESIP) to guide investments in the sector. NESSAP has adopted the Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) programme – an innovative methodology for mobilising communities to completely eliminate open defecation. A national strategy to promote hand-washing with soap is also being implemented by Community Water and Sanitation Agency (CSWA) in collaboration with allied agencies and the private sector. These have contributed to an increase in the proportion of the population with access to basic sanitation services from 14.3 percent in 2015 to 21 percent in 2017. The percentage change was higher in rural areas than in urban areas (Figure 4.6. 3).

Indicator 6.3.2: Proportion of bodies of water with good ambient water quality Environmental Sanitation Strategy Ghana has adopted Water Quality Index as a proxy for assessing ambient water quality. There has been marginal improvement in water 
quality indices for the Coastal, Southwestern and Volta basins between 2017 and 2018. The Coastal and Volta basins recorded significant improvement from 51.1 percent and 54.3 percent in 2017 to 57 percent and 57.2 percent in 2018 respectively. Ongoing efforts to improve the quality of water bodies include: the establishment of inter-ministerial committee on illegal mining; the implementation of the Multi-sectoral Mining Integrated Project (MMIP);

ENSURE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE, RELIABLE, SUSTAINABLE AND 
MODERN ENERGY FOR ALL 
Indicator 7.1.1: Proportion of population with access to electricity 
Access to electricity by the population continue to improve with 81.1 percent 
connected to the national grid in 2017 (Figure 4.7.1). Upper East Region has the lowest access rate of 47.7 percent, while Greater Accra has the highest rate of 93.7 percent. More female headed households (81.8 percent) have access to electricity than male headed ones (80.7 percent) (Figure 4.7.2).

For a larger proportion of this population, 	off-grid 	and 	mini-grid solutions have been adopted to meet their electricity needs. A National Electrification Scheme (NES) is being implemented 	to 	expand 	electricity supply 	to 	all 	communities 	with population above 500 inhabitant by 
2020. The scheme relies on two practical 7(2016/17) 
programmes namely the Self Help Electrification Programme (SHEP) for communities within 20 kilometres of existing 11/33 kV gridlines; and the specific strategy for remote off-grid and island communities, providing financial support to initial PV products investments. Under the SHEP, over 5,000 communities in Ghana were connected to the national electricity grid in 2018. 

Indicator 7.1.2: Proportion of population with primary reliance on clean fuels and technology 
The use of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) and electricity for cooking, a measure of reliance on clean fuels, increased from 22.3 percent in 2013 to 26.7 percent in 2017, continuing an increasing trend since 2007 (Figure 4.7.3). Use of LPG and electricity by both urban and rural population has improved.

LPG as compared to charcoal (even though charcoal is more expensive on an energy basis). 
Government launched the Rural LPG Programme (RLP) in November 2013 to contribute to Ghana's overarching goal to expand LPG access to 50 percent of Ghana's population by 2020. Fuel cost, poor LPG access, and an inadequate implementation framework hinder the RLP Ghana's overarching goal. The implementation of the cylinder recirculation model is expected to improve access to LPG.7 
Indicator 7.2.1: Renewable energy share in the total final energy consumption 
Power from renewable energy installations has increased from about 3 MWp8 in 2013 to 43 MWp in 2017. Solar PV generation constitutes 0.3% of total generation in 2018 compared to thermal (69.3 percent) and Hydro (30.4 percent). 
A renewable energy master plan to guide the development and promotion of renewable energy resources for socio-economic growth and reduction of climate change effects is being implemented. The Renewable Energy Act of 2011 is being implemented with the main objective to provide the legal and regulatory framework necessary for developing and expanding the

Several CSOs and private sector organisations are actively engaged in the energy sector providing innovative solutions to help increase access to clean energy, particularly in the area of clean cooking stove and roof top solar panels. 
 
Box 4.7.1: Improving access to clean cooking fuel 
Connecticut Alliance of Foster and Adoptive Families (CAFAF), a non-governmental organisation, has a project dubbed “Sustainable Clean Cooking for Life in Ghana” which seeks to overcome the challenges of cooking with fuel wood and inefficient stoves. The long-term objective is to upscale the use of clean cooking technology into the Ghanaian system with the benefits of improved health, gender empowerment, and curb the impact of climate change. It has organised several awareness campaigns and capacity building training programmes in collaboration with local authorities, and other stakeholders, to help change the negative attitudes and concepts of local people towards climate change, environment and clean cooking.  This project helps improve livelihood strategies of communities. It impacts directly on community leaders, school cooks, pantry hands, caterers, school food vendors, food handlers, homes, poorer communities, slum communities in the cities, women groups and children, indigenous caterers, street food vendors, health facilities, women agro food processors and manufacturers, fish mongers and processors, food event organisers, fast food operators, market women associations, women in post-harvest handling of food products, and value addition food handlers. 
The project is in line with the Ghana Country Action Plan (CAP) for clean cooking which seeks to help urban, low and middle income families move from charcoal dependence to clean fuels such as LPG and/or from moderate efficiency, high emissions cookstoves to high efficiency, low emissions cookstoves. Phase two of the CAP is aimed at reaching rural, low income families who are currently dependent on collected fuel wood for cooking and transitioning this population to increased efficiency wood cookstoves.  PROMOTE SUSTAINED, INCLUSIVE AND SUSTAINABLE 
ECONOMIC GROWTH, FULL AND PRODUCTIVE EMPLOYMENT 
AND DECENT WORK FOR ALL 
 
Indicator 8.1.1: Annual growth rate of real GDP per capita 
Real GDP per capita has generally improved over the last decade. Annual growth rate of GDP per capita increased from 1.6 percent in 2007 to 3.9 percent in 2018 (Figure 8.1). The highest GDP per capita growth was recorded in 2011 (11.3 percent), while the lowest was in 2015 (-0.1 percent). The strong growth in per capita income recorded between 2015 and 2018 has been attributed, in part, to strong economic growth and prudent economic management.  
The improvement in economic growth has resulted from implementation of flagship programmes and strong performance in the oil and gas sector. The Bank of Ghana has been effective in implementing monetary policy, resulting in consistent decline in inflation and recording the longest sustained single digit inflation, declining interest rates, and a relatively stable currency. Bank of Ghana has also taken steps towards restoring the health and resilience of the banking sector.

Indicator 8.5.2: Unemployment rate, by sex, age and persons with disabilities 
The national unemployment rate was estimated at 6.5 percent in 2013, based on the strict definition of unemployment by ILO6.  Unemployment rate was estimated based on the relaxed 
definition10 for 2015 Labour Force Survey and GLSS Round 7. Unemployment increased from 11.6 percent in 2015 to 14.1 percent in 2017 (Figure 4.8.2).  Unemployment remains high in urban areas (16.7 percent) compared to rural areas (11.4 percent) (Figure 4.8.3). 
The bulk of the population are employed in the informal sector, where remuneration is generally low with practically non-existent safety nets. The informal sector presents a challenge to the decent work agenda given the large proportion of Ghanaians operating in the sector.  
 

The youth unemployment rate in Ghana is estimated at 26.4 percent as at 2017 representing an increase of 15.5 percentage points from 2013. Giving the high labour underutilisation rate of 42 percent, the proportion of unemployed youth could be more. Youth unemployment is high among females and is largely an urban phenomenon.   
In response to these emerging challenges of the youth, government prioritised job creation especially for the youth in its national development blue print, “Agenda for Jobs: Creating Prosperity and Equal Opportunity for All, 2017-2024”. Flagship interventions being pursued in this regard include: Nation Builders Corps (NABCO) Programme; Planting for Food and Jobs; Rearing for Food and Jobs; One district, one factory; and Digital Marketing Entrepreneurial Programme.  
The National Youth Employment Agency (YEA) and the National Youth Authority (NYA) were also restructured to focus on promoting youth empowerment and young people’s participation in socio-economic development. The YEA was changed from traditional modules which had high implication for pay-roll to self-employment modules such as trade and vocation modules through Public Private Partnerships. Through the NYA government promoted the establishment of the Integrated Community Centre for Employable Skills which seeks to equip and empower the unemployed youth.   
Persons living with disability who are unemployed constitute 13% of all unemployed persons in 2017. Unemployment is highest among those with emotional disability, followed by sight, hearing and physical disabilities.  
 
 
 
 
 
Indicator 8.6.1: Percentage of youth (aged 15–24 years) not in education, employment or training  
The proportion of youth that are neither in employment, education nor training increased from 21.5 percent in 2010 to 27.1 percent in 2015. The rate is higher among females than males suggesting a higher level of inactivity outside the school system among females (Figure 4.8.5). Figure 4.8.5: Percentage of youth (15-24) that are not in Government is implementing programmes employment, education or training, 2010 and 2015 (%) focusing on the youth. The Council for 
Technical and Vocational Education and Training (COTVET) is empowering hundreds of craftsmen and apprentices across the country with competency-based training. The main beneficiaries include beauticians, cosmetologists, consumer electronics repairers, auto repairers, plumbers, furniture makers and electrical installers.  
	Government 	has 	also 	adopted 	the 
Empowering Novel Agri-business-Led Employment Model (ENABLE) to give greater access to agri-business enterprise and institutional support to the youth. Other programmes include Youth Inclusive Entrepreneurial Development Initiative for 
 Employment (YIEDIE) project and an Integrated Community Centre for Employable Skills (ICCES).  
Indicator 8.7.1: Percentage of children aged 5–17 years engaged in child labour, by sex and age 
Data from GLSS 6 (2013) indicate that at least every one in five children is involved in child labour, while about 3 in every 20 children are engaged in hazardous forms of child labour (Table 4.8.1). Child labour is more pronounced in rural than in urban areas and higher among boys than girls. The phenomenon generally increases with age.

Policies of Government to address child labour include: National Plan of Action Phase II on the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour (NPA2) (2017–2020); Strategy on Anti-Child Labour and Trafficking in Fisheries; and Hazardous Child Labour Activity Framework for the Cocoa Sector.  Government funded and participated in educational, social, and awareness creation programmes with the goal of eliminating or preventing child labour.  
Indicator 8.10.1: Number of (a) commercial bank branches per 100,000 adults, (b) number of automated teller machines (ATMs) per 100,000 adults. 
Access to financial and banking services by Ghanaians continues to improve over the years. Both coverage of bank branches and ATM continue to record improvement over time. Bank branches increased from 9.2 in 2017 to 9.3 per 100,000 adults in 2018. Similarly, the number of ATMs increased from 9.2 to 9.3 per 100,000 adults over the same period (Figure 4.8.6).  Electronic payments for goods and services have increased with a 13 percent rise in the number of point of sale (POS) terminals from 6,501 in 2016 to 7,356 in 2017.

Domestic and International passengers and freight volumes by air transport  
Source: Ghana Airport Company Limited, 2017 Transportation of passengers by Figure 4.9.1: Domestic and international passengers carried by air domestic airlines increased from transport, 2005-2017 (passengers in thousands) 421,986 in 2016 to 483,261 in 2017 (Figure 4.9.1). This increase has been attributed in part to the abolishment of 17.5 percent of Value Added Tax (VAT) on airline tickets and renovations of some local airports. Similarly, the number of international passengers transported by air, also increased from about 1,746,699 in 2016 to about 1,811,428 in 2017. This is largely due to increase in frequency of existing flights, commencement of operations of new airlines in Ghana and introduction of new routes by some local airlines.  
As part of the long term vision to make Ghana an aviation hub within the West African sub-region, government embarked on a number of programmes to improve the infrastructure at the various airports including the expansion and refurbishment of Kotoka International Airport (KIA) and upgrading of Kumasi and Tamale airports to international status.

support industrial Source: Ghana Statistical Service, Gross Domestic Products (GDP), 2018 development. Manufacturing value added per capita on the other hand increased steeply from 2012 (GH¢165) to 2013 (GH¢550) and has been consistently appreciating since then to GH¢909 in 2017 (Figure 4.9.6). 


 
Indicator 9.2.2: Manufacturing employment as a proportion of total employment 
Manufacturing as a share of employment increased from 9.1 percent in 2013 to 13.5 percent in 2015. This is driven in part by the increment of female workers in the manufacturing sector which increased from 10.3 percent in 2013 to 17.8 percent in 2015 (Figure 4.9.7). The proportion of male workers increased from 7.7 percent in 2013 to 8.6 percent in 2015 (Figure 4.9.7).  
To position the manufacturing sector to serve as a catalyst for accelerated job creation 	and 	economic 	growth, 
government’s medium term policy is aimed Source: 2010 population census, GLSS 6 of 2012/13 and 2015 at building competitive industries in all Labour Force Survey, Ghana Statistical Service districts across the country. For the attainment of this objective, government is implementing flagship industrial development initiatives such as: One district, one factory; Strategic Anchor Industrial Development Initiatives; and revitalisation of viable but financially distressed companies. Other complementary interventions being pursued by government are: improving the availability and reliability of energy; improving research and development; increasing production and supply of raw materials; and ensuring the development of appropriate skills for the industrial sector. 
Indicator 9.4.1: CO2 emission per unit of value added 
The energy sector is currently responsible for the highest emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) in Ghana with transport and electricity generation being the main sources of these gases. CO2 emissions from manufacturing and construction industries are largely from the combustion of fuels. Ghana’s CO2 emissions per unit of MVA decreased from 0.68 kg CO2/US$ in 2014 to 0.67 kg CO2/US$ in 2016 (Figure 4.9.8).

To reduce GHG emissions government is focusing on the following priority actions: implementation of the National Climate Change Policy (NCCP); the GHG Inventory Initiative of EPA; Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD); Ghana National Low Carbon 
Development (GNLCD) Strategy; and promoting low carbon growth through Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMA).  The Ghana National Cleaner Production Centre has been set up to implement projects and activities that will promote resource efficiency and cleaner production in the areas of energy, waste management, water and material efficiency practices in industries, to reduce manufacturing cost, lower pollution and improve health and safety. In addition, National Greenhouse gas Inventory and National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Manual of Procedures, have been prepared, and a survey conducted to estimate GHG emissions from commercial generators.  
Indicator 9.5.1: Research and development expenditure as a proportion of GDP 
The share of research and development (R&D) expenditure as a percentage of GDP was estimated at 0.38 percent in 2012, which has improved to 0.45 percent in 2017. The rate of adoption of improved locally packaged technologies by MSME remained at 35 percent. The number of research findings adopted by industry has been increasing over the period and significantly improved from 70 in 2016 to 115 in 2017. 
As part of Ghana’s efforts to increase public and private spending on R&D, government in 2019 approved a minimum of 1 percent of GDP to be spent on R&D. This is expected to increase to 2.5 percent in the medium to long-term.  
For accelerated development of science and research, the following initiatives have been prioritised by government: 
• The setting up of the Ghana Innovation and Research Commercialisation Centre (GIRCCentre) to serve as the bridge between the Government, public research institutions, academia and industry;  
• The National Entrepreneurship and Innovations Plan to aid the establishment of  incubation centres with basic facilities required by Ghanaian innovators; 
• Revamping the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) programme; 
• Enactment of a Science Technology and Innovation (STI) law to facilitate the implementation of the STI Policy.  
In addition to these initiatives, the government has also proposed the creation of a Science, 
Technology, and Innovation (STI) fund, the setting up of a Foundry and a Computer Numerical 
Control Machine Tools Centre both in Accra and Kumasi, as part of the focus on developing 
strategic technologies and centres of excellence across the country. A Presidential Advisory Council on Science, Technology and Innovation (PASTI) has been set up to advise the President on issues related to STI.

Indicator 10.1.1: Growth rates of household expenditure or income per capita among the bottom 40 per cent of the population and the total population. 
Overall reduction in Figure 4.10.1: Expenditure share of the bottom 40 percent of poverty rates in Ghana is the population, 2013 and 2017 (%) 
expected to lead to an improvement in overall well-being of the poor. Data from GLSS 5 and 6 show an increase in the share of expenditure of the bottom 40 percent of the population from 12.5 percent in 2013 to 22 percent in 2017, increasing at an annual average of 2 percent. The improvement translated 	in 	growth 	of 	household 
expenditure of 0.1 percent over the period. 	Source: GSS, GLSS 2013 and 2017 
Analysis of income distribution using the Gini Index shows widening income inequality since 1992, increasing from 37 percent to 43 percent in 2017. However the rate of increase has slowed between 
2005 and 2017 (Figure 4.10.2). Income inequality is Figure 4.10.2: Trends in Gini Index, 1991/92relatively higher in rural areas than urban areas and in 2016/17 (%) the three northern regions compared to the rest of the country. The widening income inequality has implications for sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction.

Indicator 10.2.1: Proportion of people living below 50 per cent of median income, by sex, age and persons with disabilities. 
Data from GLSS 6 and 7 reveal that the number of people living below 50 percent of median income (a measure of relative poverty) reduced from 12.4 percent in 2013 to 12 percent in 2017. The trend was similar for five regions of the country namely: Western, Central, Greater Accra, Eastern and 
Ashanti. The same pattern was observed in urban areas and for both males and females (Figure 10.3).  
Fiscal and socio-economic policies implemented in Ghana over the years have had little impact on reducing inequality. To address the situation, Government is improving the targeting mechanism in the implementation of pro-poor programmes to ensure balanced development and addressing rising inequality. These include Infrastructure for Poverty Eradication Programme (IPEP); creation of development authorities including Northern Development Authority (NDA), Middle Belt Development Authority (MBA), Coastal Development Authority (CDA) and establishment of Zongo Development Fund to bridge spatial gaps in socio-economic development.

The recorded incidence of disasters across the country increased from 962 in 2016 to 1,134 in 2017, and 2,007 in 2018. Disasters affected 3,386 communities, 1,073 schools, 28,095 houses, and 17,957 hectares of farmlands in 2018. The total number of people who were affected by various kinds of hazards across the country increased from 287,399 in 2017 to 314,644 in 2018. The number of people who died, sustained injuries or were affected by floods per 100,000 population in 2018 increased by 4 percent, while those affected by domestic and commercial fires went up by 453 percent (Table 4.11.1). Those affected by wind and rainstorm declined by 20 percent, and bush fires declined by 37.5 percent. Regional disaggregation of persons affected by disasters in 2018 was highest in Ashanti, followed by Northern, Upper East and Greater Accra regions (Figure 4.11.1).

Though Ghana signed the SENDAI framework for disaster risks reduction it is yet to draw up a comprehensive action plan on its implementation. Major challenges for disaster management in Ghana include: limited early warning systems, poor coordination among institutions and weak post disaster recovery and rehabilitation mechanisms.  
Indicator 11.6.2: Annual mean levels of fine particulate matter (e.g. PM2.5 and PM10) in cities (population weighted) 
Analysis of air quality are presently conducted Figure 4.11.1: Annual Mean Level of Fine Particulate along 14 selected air quality stations along the Matter (PM10), Greater Accra 
Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) route and some residential, commercial and industrial areas in Accra. The analysis shows high levels of pollution above the WHO and EPA guideline levels of 70µg/m3 in these selected areas. The annual mean particulate matter (PM) pollution level was 265 µg/m3 in 2016 compared to 266 µg/m3 in 2015.  
As part of the effort to enhance air quality monitoring, EPA deployed an additional lowcost PM air sensor network in Accra to 
complement its existing network of air quality monitors. This enhanced capacity will enable EPA  integrate an advanced data system into air quality monitoring and management practices and communicate timely air quality information to the public.

The priority initiatives being implemented by government to ensure sustainable production and consumption include: the up-scaling of Cleaner Production Centres; conversion of EPA environmental guidelines into standards; the promotion of recycling (waste to energy, compost); Ghana appliance energy efficiency standards and labelling programme; promotion of roof top solar energy panels; establishment of electronic waste recycling facility; Planting for Food and Jobs Programme; ‘One district, one warehouse’ initiative; Warehouse receipt system; and expanding the operations of the National Food Buffer Stock Company. 
TAKE URGENT ACTION TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE AND ITS IMPACTS 
In line with its international obligation under the Climate Change Agreement, the country has prepared the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC). 
Ghana has developed a National Climate Change Policy (NCCP) together with 
a Low Carbon Development Strategy to facilitate the operationalization of the mitigation objectives of the NCCP. Various national policies and guidelines such as the National Environment Policy, Energy policy, National Policy on Public Private Partnership, National Transport Policy and National Forest and Wildlife Policy have all been made climate compliant.  
Ghana recognises the importance of implementing climate change adaptation and mitigation measures at all levels. As such, development plans of MDAs and local governments are subjected to climate change assessment.  
Disaster risk reduction and climate change have been mainstreamed into development planning at national and subnational levels. Climate change issues have also been mainstreamed into guidelines for the preparation of the annual budget. 
Indicator 13.2.1: Number of countries that have communicated the establishment or operationalization of an integrated policy/strategy/plan which increases their ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change, and foster climate resilience and low greenhouse gas emissions development in a manner that does not threaten food production (including a national adaptation plan, nationally determined contribution, national communication, biennial update report or other) 
Ghana has developed a climate change policy and action plan that seeks to enhance climate resilience and adaptation across all sectors. Ghana has submitted its nationally determined contributions, national communication and biennial update reports to UNFCCC outlining the country’s progress on actions to enhance climate adaptation and mitigation. 
Currently, the country has the following strategic documents to address issues of climate change: National Climate Change Policy, National Climate Change Master Plan, Implementation Plan for Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) Investment & Implementation Plan, National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy, 2016 National REDD+ Strategy, 2016-2040 National Forestry Plantation Strategy and 2018-2021 Medium-term Development Policy Framework. Ghana’s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) identifies emission reduction actions to be undertaken between 2020 and 2030 in the energy; transportation; agriculture, forestry and land use; waste; and industry sectors. 
Emerging issues associated with the climate change in Ghana include the development of harmonised reporting for both Paris Agreement and SDG 13. Major opportunities are also emerging within the private sector and the Government is considering how to promote a stronger involvement of the private sector in climate change responses. The Government is also considering the potential for a national financing mechanism or facility that can meet the needs of different themes, such as renewable energy or gender, without having a proliferation of funds and procedures.  
Indicator 13.3.1 Number of Countries that have integrated mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning into primary, secondary and tertiary curricula 
Climate change has been integrated in the school curriculum and would be taught in all primary schools from the beginning 2019/2020 academic year and extended to junior and senior high schools in subsequent years. As a result, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is expected to train teachers across the country with Teaching and Learning Materials (TLMs) ahead of the commencement of the academic year. In addition, climate change courses have been introduced in four public universities. The objective of this initiative is to improve the knowledge of pupils and help change behaviour of both children and adults towards the environment and thereby help in the fight against the impact of climate change in the country.

Ghana’s ocean faces a number of challenges including excessive pollution of the beaches and dumping of waste... To forestall and ensure the protection of its oceans, Ghana in line with the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), 1982, has promulgated about six main Laws and Acts that regulate marine activities in Ghana. The country has also formed partnerships with the European Union, United States, African Maritime Law Enforcement Partnership, Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF) and the Fisheries Committee for the West Central Gulf of Guinea to enforce marine laws.  Also, the fisheries monitoring, control and surveillance programme has been instituted and intensified to minimize illegal fishing while sea patrol teams have been increased.

Some of the interventions used over the years to address homicide and crimes in general are enhancement 	of 	police-public 	relations, improved recruitment processes, upholding professionalism, improving ethical standards and rules of engagement, retooling the police, 
improving the conditions of service, capacity Source: Ghana Police Service, Annual Progress Reports, building, enhancing witness protection, use of 2012-2017 technology, etc.  
16.1.3 Proportion of population subjected to physical, psychological and sexual violence in the previous 12 months 
Available data indicates that psychological violence remains the highest form of violence suffered by the population, and women are more likely to be victims than men. The proportion of the female population estimated to have suffer psychological violence was 9.3 percent in 2013 compared to 7.9 percent for men (Figure 4.16.1). Physical and sexual violence among the female population were 6.1 percent and 2.5 percent respectively. This was more than twice the incidence in the male population. On the other hand, economic violence was higher than social violence among both the female and male population. Economic violence for the female population was estimated at 12.8 percent compared to 11.6 percent for social violence (Figure 4.16.2).

Ghana has enacted legislation to prevent all forms of domestic violence and abuse, ensure access to justice and provide the necessary institutional support to affected women and men. The Domestic Violence Act 2007 (Act 732) provides comprehensive framework for the prevention of and protection against domestic violence and criminalises various forms of physical and sexual violence, economic and psychological abuse and intimidation. The capacity of the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection (MoGCSP) and the Domestic Violence and Victims Support Unit (DOVVSU) of the Ghana Police Service continue to be enhanced to coordinate the implementation of the provisions in the Act. In addition, DOVVSU in partnership with the Department of Social Development, the International Federation of Women Lawyers (FIDA) and the Legal Aid Scheme have instituted a comprehensive support mechanism for victims of domestic violence.  
Indicator 16.1.4: Proportion of population that feel safe walking alone around the area they live 
The proportion of population that feel safe around the area they live declined from 94.9 percent in 2013 to 93.8 percent in 2017. Those who feel unsafe has increased in both urban and rural areas with rural area recording the largest increase from 3.5 percent in 2013 to 5.5 percent in 2017 (Figure 4.16.4).

16.2.1 Percentage of children aged 1-14 who experienced any physical punishment and/or psychological aggression by caregivers in the past one month 
The 1992 constitution of Ghana as well as Figure 4:16.5: Percentage of children aged 1-14 who experienced the 2007 Domestic Violence Act (Act 732) provide legislative support in favour of protecting children from all violence. However, the Ghana Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) of 2011 and 2017 show that 94 percent of children aged 1-14 years were subject to some form of violent (physical/psychological) 	disciplinary method.  The data prove that six years after the 2011 MICS, no improvement has been seen in the situation of the child as far as physical punishment and/or psychological 
aggression by caregivers are concerned. 	Source: GSS, MICS 2011 & 2017 
Recommended interventions/strategies to address this challenge include: home visitation programs by social workers to reduce maltreatment of infants and toddlers; parenting programs that include positive social-emotional skills components or aim to prevent violence by peers or partners; reducing violent behaviours and bullying; and reducing abusive or neglectful parenting.  
Indicator 16.3.1 Proportion of victims of violence in the previous 12 months who reported their victimization to competent authorities or other officially recognized conflict resolution mechanisms 
Generally, the proportion of victims of violence in the previous 12 months who reported their victimization to the police increased from 27.7 percent in 2013 to 30.5 percent in 2017. Similar trend was observed in both the urban and rural areas, however, the rural area recorded the largest increase from 24 percent to 27.9 percent during the same period (Figure 4.16.6). However, four out of 10 regions recorded an increase in the number of victims reporting their victimisation to the police (Figure 4.16.7) 
Some of the reasons cited for reporting to the police include, the fear of attack, assault or threat on victim’s life; the desire to see victims’ offender punished; and the need to ensure that offenders stop committing further crimes.

Indicator 16.3.2: Unsentenced detainees as a proportion of overall prison population 
Some prisons in the country have had detainees who had been on remand for longer than the constitutionally stipulated duration. Individuals detained in police cells were also frequently held on remand for longer than the constitutionally mandated limit of 48 hours. This is observed in police cells nation-wide in violation of Chapter 5, Act 14, Clause 3 of the Constitution.7 
The proportion of persons held in detention who have not yet been sentenced has dropped from 18.24 percent of the total prison population in 2015 to 13.14 percent in 2018.  
Relevant stakeholders within the criminal justice system have initiated interventions to mitigate the challenges affecting the rights of pre-trial detainees. One example is the ‘Justice For All,’ which has reduced the pre-trial (remand) population from 30 percent at its inception in 2007 to 13 percent in 2018, as a result of the expeditious disposal of prolonged pre-trial cases.

Generally, the proportion of persons Figure 4:16.9: Proportion of population who reported having paid who reported paying bribe to public additional money to government officials, 2013 & 2017 (%) officials declined from 31.6 percent in 2013 to 29.9 percent in 2017. The decline was observed across sex of 40 persons and in urban areas. The number of persons who reported paying bribes, however, increased in rural areas from 25.1 percent to 26.1 percent over the same period (Figure 4.16.9).

The proportion of children under 5 years whose Figure 4:16.10: Percentage of children under-5 years whose birth has  been registered in the country births have been registered, 2011 & 2017 (%) increased from 63 percent in 2011 to about 71 percent in 2017 (Figure 4.16.10).  
The mobile birth (M-birth), which uses ICT to register children 0-12 months, is a key intervention introduced to promote accelerated registration of children under 5 years. In the pilot implementation of the M-birth between 2015 and 2016 in 8 of the 10 administrative regions nationwide, birth registration increased 
from about 58 percent to 63 percent for Source: GSS, MICS 2011 and 2017 children 0-12 months. Other complementary interventions implemented during the period are awareness creation campaigns and removal of registration fees for children less than a year old. 
 
Target 16.10.2: Number of countries that adopt and implement constitutional, statutory and/or policy guarantees for public access to information 
The Ministries of Information and Justice and Attorney General co-sponsored the Right to Information (RTI) bill and the Parliament of Ghana passed it into law on March 26, 2019..This law was enacted to increase access to certain categories of information by the general public. It also seeks to foster a culture of transparency and accountability in public affairs.  
The availability and use of information and data is a critical component of efforts to achieving sustainable development. Before passing the RTI, Ghana had already signed onto the open data government partnership in 2011 which declared open data as a focus area in order to achieve transparent and accountable governance and build a community of data suppliers and users. . The passage of the RTI is a step in the right direction and will help consolidate the open data movement in the country.  
The implementation of the law has been deferred to 2020 to enable the government to establish information units in all public offices; recruit and train information officers; establish the RTI Commission; and complete various administrative protocols. 

STRENGTHEN THE MEANS OF IMPLEMENTATION AND REVITALIZE THE GLOBAL PARTNERSHIP FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 
Indicator 17.1.1: Total Government Revenue as a Percentage of GDP, 2012-2018  
Total Government Revenues (TGR) as a percentage of GDP has declined from 22.9 
percent in 2015 to 15.6 percent in 2018. The largest decline of about 4.6 percentage points was recorded between 2017 and 2018 and this has been attributed in part to the rebasing in national accounts8.  Both domestic and tax revenue as a percentage of GDP also fell between 2017 and 2018. (Figure 4.17.1). 
Government is implementing a number of measures to  increase domestic revenues including broadening the tax base; introducing the  Tax Identification Number (TIN); operationalising the presumptive tax system; implementing the excise tax stamps; operationalising the paperless port system; and reviewing the tax exemption regime.

Indicator 17.3.1: Foreign direct investments (FDI), official development assistance and SouthSouth Cooperation as a proportion of total domestic budget 
Net FDI inflows as a share of the national budget fluctuated between 2012 and 2018 (Figure 4.17.3). Total FDI inflows to Ghana stood at US$2,983.4 million in 2012, and increased to US$3,356.9 million in 2014. These declined to US$2,970.8 million in 2015 but subsequently increased to US$4,100 million in 2017. The increase in 2017 is attributed partly to improved confidence of the business community and political stability in the country. Even though net FDI inflows as a share of national budget fell from US$4,100 million in 2017 to US$3,300 million in 2018, Ghana was the largest recipient of FDI in West Africa in 20189.

Both the absolute amount and proportion of ODA in the total national budget declined between 2010 and 2017 (Figure 4.17.4). The proportion of ODA in the national budget declined from 21.7 percent in 2010 to 10.2 percent in 2017. This is largely on account of Ghana attaining the status of a lower middle-income country and therefore unable to access some concessional facilities. This new status led to the discontinuation of the Multi-Donor Budget Support (MDBS) mechanism, which served as an aid coordination arrangement. 
Indicator 17.3.2: Volume of remittances (in United States dollars) as a proportion of total GDP, 2012-2017 
Remittances from abroad remain an important source of foreign exchange. The share of remittances and has increased from 4.2 percent in 2012 to 5.5 percent in 2017 (Figure 4.17.5). Over the same period, remittances peaked at 6.6 percent of GDP in 2015 but declined to 3.4 percent in 2016 before increasing to 5.5 percent in 2017.

To effectively manage Ghana’s public debt stock, a medium-term debt management strategy was prepared in accordance with sections 54 to 78 of the Public Financial Management Act, 2016 (Act 921). The strategy seeks to ensure improved liability management and undertake re-profiling of 
public debt. 	Source: Ministry of Finance, 2018 
Indicator 17.8.1: Proportion of individuals using the Internet 
Information and communication technology (ICT) is a major facilitator of economic and social transformation. It is an important tool for increasing efficiency and effectiveness in both public and private sector as it provides efficient storage and quick access to information. The recent efforts of government in developing ICT has focused on promoting rapid development and deployment of ICT infrastructure, strengthening institutional and regulatory framework for managing the ICT sector.  
The proportion of individuals using the internet has consistently increased for both urban and rural areas, reaching an average of 98 percent in 2017 (Figure 4.17.7). Males had a higher proportion of internet usage than females in 2006, 2013 and 2017, though the general trend for both was rising.

	5.1 	Children And Youth Engagement And 
Participation In SDGs Implementation Processes In 
Ghana 
The VNR process evaluated the different ways in which children and youth are involved in SDGs advocacy, implementation, monitoring and reporting at national and sub-national levels. Policy documents and reports were analysed to establish the status of children and youth development activities and linkages to SDGs and corresponding Agenda 2063 targets. Also, innovations and good practices were identified. Based on the analysis, strategies were proposed to deepen the engagement of young people in SDGs processes and national development. The review also considered the institutional and regulatory environment, emerging issues and their implications for child and youth development and lessons learnt. 
The study process was mainly through secondary information review focusing on the medium-term national development policy framework, 2018-2021; national policies; annual progress reports; survey and statistical reports; and information from development partners, research institutions, CSOs, NGOs and the private sector. 
Policy and Institutional Support for Children and Youth Development 
Over the years, the concerns of young people have engaged the attention of governments, policy makers and programme implementers. However, issues of unemployment, inadequate participation in decision making, uncoordinated policies and lack of synergies persist. Most of the young population that has had some education have not transited into decent jobs and many young people are in vulnerable employment especially in the informal sector.  
Over the past two decade, several structures for youth employment and development have been established, restructured or reviewed, including the National Youth Employment Programme (NYEP, 2006), the Ghana Youth Employment and Entrepreneurial Development Agency 
(GYEEDA, 2012) and the Youth Employment Agency (YEA, 2015). In 2016, the National Youth Authority Act, 2016 (Act 939) was enacted with the core mandate to coordinate and facilitate youth development activities. Measures to protect the well-being and welfare of Ghanaian children include                   the Children’s Act, 1998 (Act 560); Child and Family Welfare Policy (2014), and the Child Protection Policy (2013).  
The National Youth Policy (2010) and its Implementation Plan prioritised human development and technology; economic empowerment; youth participation, governance and leadership; culture, sports and national orientation. The Child and Family Welfare Policy (2013) seeks to prevent and protect children from all forms of violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation; effectively coordinate 
Page 99 Ghana’s interpretation of “youth” is based on the African Union (AU) definition which is from 15 to 35 years of age, while a “child” is 0-18 years. Ghana has a relatively youthful population with over 60 percent being less than 25 years of age.  
Youth Employment Programmes 
• Public 	Youth 	Development Programmes 
• Over 20 public youth employment programmes 
• Youth Employment Agency

• National Service Scheme 
• Nation 	Builders 	Corps (NABCo) 
• National 	Entrepreneurship Innovation Plan 
• Planting for Food and Jobs Programme 
• Youth 	in 	Agriculture

Agribusiness-Led Employment for Youth (ENABLE Youth) under the Rural Enterprises Programme (REP) 
 
child and family welfare systems at all levels; empower children and families to better understand abusive situation and make choices to prevent and respond to situations of risk, among others. 
The objective for youth development under the mediumterm national development policy framework (2018-2021) is to create opportunities for effective and positive youth participation in national socio-economic development and political governance. Specific provisions that align with the SDGs include the following:  
i. Equip the youth with employable skills;  
ii. Strengthen the link between education and the labour market;  
iii. Build the capacity of the youth to discover opportunities;  
iv. Create youth desks in local authorities to provide reliable labour market information;  
v. Strengthen key national institutions to discharge their mandates effectively; and  
vi. Build integrated youth centres in all districts to serve 
as an information hub for youth development. 
 
 

To promote skills development and entrepreneurship, government also plans to:  
i. encourage science, technical, vocational and entrepreneurship education at all levels of education;  
ii. facilitate partnerships between educational institutions and corporate Ghana through attachments, internships and volunteer opportunities;  
iii. increase the quality of and access to post-basic education skills training;  iv. provide apprenticeships and employable skills training for out-of-school youth and graduates;   
v. provide resources for the youth to participate in modern agriculture. 
Interventions to promote participation of the youth in politics, electoral democracy, and governance include:  
i. strengthening civic education, governance and democracy in school curricula; 
ii. creating opportunities for young people to practice political and civic engagement throughout the electoral cycle;  
iii. introducing programmes to break the cycle of violence and crime; and 
iv. promoting awareness of the rights and responsibilities of the youth. 
However, the two key implementation agencies, the National Youth Authority (NYA) and the Youth Employment Agency (YEA), are supervised by different ministries, thereby creating coordination challenge in some cases. Beyond the two agencies, there are over 20 other skills training institutions and special initiatives targeted at employment creation for the youth including the Nation Builders Corps (NABCo) programme, rolled out in 2018, which aims at providing transitional jobs and training for unemployed graduates.  
National budgets have made provision for children and youth-related programmes largely through institutions with mandates for child and youth development, national flagship programmes, local governments and social protection programmes. 
Awareness, Ownership and Critical SDGs issues 
A poll carried out by UNICEF using the U-Report Application (a Web-Based SMS interactive Realtime monitoring tool) in March 2019,10 showed that 46 percent of the respondents were not aware of the SDGs and 15 percent had vague knowledge. This supported the outcome of a similar exercise held in November 2018 when only 13 percent of respondents indicated that they knew a lot about the SDGs. In this knowledgeable category, across all the regions, the proportion of females was higher (48 percent) than that of males (41 percent). Interestingly, a higher percentage was recorded for those within the age range 0-14 years (73 percent) than those between the ages of 15-19 years (68 percent) 
The U-Report in March 2019 showed that almost half (47 percent) of respondents identify unavailability of jobs as a major issue, with access to quality education the next most important issue. In a similar poll conducted in August 2018, the highest priority for young people was learning skills for employability. This result is consistent with the outcomes of a consultative meeting with the youth on 20th 
March, 2019 in which participants identified access to quality education and higher 
education as critical development needs of the youth. 
In 2017, a network of about 350 youth-led organisations – the Voices of Youth Coalition – drafted the People’s National Youth Manifesto to reflect the views of young people in Ghana.  The document contains policy options and proposals to place youth issues and perspectives at the heart of Ghana’s development agenda. It covers pressing youth development issues, taking into account internationally agreed frameworks such as the World Programme of Action for Youth and the African Youth Charter.  
 Interventions by State and Non-State Actors 
According to the 2015 Labour Force Survey, only 25.5 percent of the youth are engaged in agricultural activities, with a greater proportion of males (30.1 percent) than females (21.6 percent). The government is keen on promoting agriculture as a viable business among the youth through (i) support to the youth for enterprise development along the agricultural value chain; (ii) support for off-farm activities such as aggregation, processing, packaging and transportation; (iii) provision of finance through financial institutions; (iv) special capacity building for young people in agricultural operations; and (v) supporting the youth to gain access to land. Government programmes such as the Youth in Agriculture Programme (YIAP), Planting for Food and Jobs (PFJ), and Planting for Export and Rural Development (PERD) are channels for delivering support for young people. 
Private and non-state entities have also supported interventions for young people in agriculture including the Kosmos Innovation Centre Programme; the Future Farmers Initiative of Young Professionals for Agricultural Development11 (YPARD); Enhancing Growth in New Enterprise programme12 (ENGINE) 
Youth Inclusive Entrepreneurial Development Initiative for Employment13 (YIEDIE). These interventions focus on:  
i. promoting agribusiness and leveraging the nexus between ICT and agriculture;  
ii. networking of young agri-preneurs and broadening their opportunities in the agricultural value chain; 
iii. promoting businesses along the vegetable value chain; 
iv. practical knowledge development in agribusiness through research, incubation models and college farms; 
v. improvement of business planning capacity and internal operations through services support, financing, mentorship, partnership and network building; 
vi. fostering better coordination and support; and 
vii. skills training in agro-processing, financial literacy and credit for young women 
 Building Youth Human Capital for Socio-Economic Development 
Steady progress has been made in improving the health of Ghanaians including the children and youth through better access to health services. However, adolescent health – with particular emphasis on sexually transmitted infections (STIs), HIV/AIDS, abortion, teenage pregnancy and motherhood – remains a challenge. According to the 2017 Ghana Maternal Health Survey, 14 percent of women aged 15-19 have begun childbearing. Contraceptive use among currently married women aged 15-49 was at 25 percent in 2017, and there is still a need for sustained education and awareness creation on the effects of teenage parenting14. 
The introduction of free senior high school (SHS) by the government in 2017 is aimed at widening access of young people, particularly the under-served, to quality education and skills training. The government’s Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) Transformation Strategic Plan (2018-2022) is also intended to deliver high-quality employable skills and industry-related qualifications that are usable in local and international labour markets. For a large section of the youth in the informal economy, the dominant avenue for skills acquisition is through traditional apprenticeships.  
These policy initiatives are all aimed at creating an enabling environment for youth employability and job creation. They are complemented by private sector-led initiatives targeted at the youth, such as the Campaign for Female Education (CAMFED); the Youth Works Project financed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; Improving the Security, Water and Sanitation Services and Hygiene Practices supported by Cummins Ghana Limited; and the Youth Engagement in Service Delivery (YES) programme for local youth organisations in the solid waste sector.  
Enhancing Youth Participation in Governance and Leadership Capacity Building 
Initiatives to enhance youth participation in governance and leadership capacity building include Project Citizen, the SDGs Youth Essay Competition and Dream Ghana Week. The last two initiatives used essay writing competitions to encourage young people to take an interest in national development and to raise awareness about their role in shaping Ghana’s future. The SDGs Youth Essay Competition was implemented by Youth Empowerment Synergy (YES). Other initiatives include the Youth for Good Governance in Ghana’s Oil Sector; Tackling Poverty Together; and the UNDP SDGs Accelerator Hub for Young People. 

5.2 	Leaving No One Behind 

 
Data from the Ghana Living 
Standards Survey suggest that: 
• Poverty declined steadily from 
51.7 percent in 1991/1992 to 39.5 percent in 1998/1999 and dropped further to 24.2 percent in 2012/2013 and to 23.4 percent in 2016/2017.   
• The poverty headcount declined by 0.8 percentage point between 2012/2013 and 2016/2017, a marginal gain compared with the 7.7 percentage points decline between 2005/2006 and 2012/2013.  
• Based on 2016/2017 data, there are 6.8 million poor people in Ghana out of a total population of 28 million. This number of poor people represented an increase from the 2012/2013 estimate the increase implies that population growth and poverty reduction are not moving at the same pace. The incidence of extreme poverty (those unable to meet their basic needs) also fell – from 16.5 percent in 2005/2006 to 8.4 percent in 2012/2013.  It fell further to 8.2 percent in 2016/2017.  However, the number of people living in extreme poverty also increased between 2013 and 2017, from 2.2 million to 2.4 million. 
 
 
Introduction 
Leaving no one behind (LNOB) is a central commitment of the 2030 Agenda. The outcome document of the intergovernmental negotiations – Transforming Our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development — notes in its declaration that: “… no one will be left behind. Recognising that the dignity of the human person is fundamental, we wish to see the goals and targets met for all nations and peoples and for all segments of society… we will endeavour to reach the furthest behind first”.  Leaving no one behind consists of ending extreme poverty in all its forms, reducing inequalities and eliminating discriminatory behaviour. 
Leaving no one behind also means that those who are furthest behind and most excluded must be prioritised, and every person should have a fair opportunity in life to enable them to reach their full potential. 
As part of the VNR process, Ghana assessed how the LNOB principle has been put into practice. Population groups in danger of being left behind were identified, as well as the underlying factors that drive their exclusion. The key policies and interventions for addressing the poverty and inequality gaps were reviewed. From the assessment, recommendations were made to strengthen this effort.  
Information on people in danger of being left behind was gathered from performance and annual review reports, strategic plans, guidelines, and particularly from the Ghana Living Standards Survey, Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, 
Labour Force Survey, Population and Housing Census, and Ghana Demographic and Health Survey. This was complemented by consultative workshops at the national and regional levels, engaging with a wide range of stakeholders. 
Rationale for LNOB 
Marginalisation of sections of the population arising from stigmatisation, harmful socio-cultural norms, lack of voice, non-participation, inadequate access to resources and basic services holds back progress on development objectives. Poverty – characterised by low income, malnutrition, illhealth, illiteracy, and insecurity among other factors – has a negative impact on human development and economic outcomes. There are strong links between poverty, low levels 

of education, poor health and inequality.  These factors pose a challenge to the achievement of inclusive development and the SDGs.   
 	 

 Who is Being Left Behind? 
Those sections of the population who are particularly vulnerable to shocks and risks include children, women and girls, people with disabilities, the elderly, rural populations, the youth, the unemployed and people in vulnerable employment. They are deprived of a dignified life and face many barriers to reaching their full potential. 
Children 
Many children in Ghana are vulnerable to maltreatment, domestic violence, sexual abuse and exploitation. Child marriage, streetism, rape and defilement of children remain a challenge to development. The transition into adolescence and adulthood brings risks to children as they not have the appropriate knowledge, support and confidence to navigate their environment. Child labour is a concern, with recent statistics suggesting that a significant number of children between the ages of 5 and 17 are engaged in it. These children, largely from the rural areas and the poorest communities, are forced into manual work, agriculture, illegal mining, fishing, hawking, head-portering, and ritual 
servitude.  	Informal 	employment 	and 
The Aged 	occupation

• 42.0 percent of underemployed according to GLSS7.  The unemployment rate for females is persons are youth. 16.5 percent as compared with 11.4 percent for males.

	respectively).   	According to the Labour Force Survey 2015, approximately 
 10 percent of the employed population is estimated to be underemployed.  Among them, 50.7 percent are female and 
49.3 percent male. Nearly 6 in every 10 (58.7 percent) of the 
underemployed are located in rural areas. More than half of the estimated underemployed persons 
are concentrated in the Northern (21.9 percent), Upper East (18.6 percent) and Greater Accra (13.6 percent). 
A large proportion of the Ghanaian population is engaged in the informal economy where employment conditions are largely unmonitored and participants are at increasing risk as they are unlikely to have safety nets against economic shocks. Available data suggest that 90 percent of employed persons work in the informal economy, with males accounting for 45.1 percent and females 54.9 percent. The proportion of females in informal employment in both rural and urban areas is higher than that of males. Informal employment ranges from 84.1 percent in the Greater Accra Region to 96.8 percent in the Brong Ahafo Region.  
Persons with Disabilities 
About one-fifth of Ghana’s population is estimated to be living with either a physical, intellectual or emotional disability.  Despite constitutional and legislative guarantees on the rights of persons with disability (PWDs), the laws have not been adequately implemented and they therefore continue to face discrimination. Social stigma and inequalities in access to employment, education and healthcare and to public facilities remain challenges to PWDs.   
Approximately one in every five children aged 2-17 years has a functioning difficulty related to seeing, hearing, walking, fine motor skills, and learning among others.  Children with disabilities are often less likely to attend school, access medical services, or have their voices heard in society. They are at risk of physical and emotional abuse, neglect, violence and exploitation.  The Youth 
The youth in Ghana represent a large share of the population with the majority living in urban areas. A large proportion of the youth remain unemployed, with a high labour underutilisation rate. The main challenges facing the youth include lack of employable skills; the mismatch of education and industry needs; inability of the economy to create new jobs at a faster rate; limited access to start-up capital; and limited opportunities to participate in political governance and decision making.  
Women and Girls 
Women and girls often face multiple and overlapping deprivations, harm and exclusion.  High levels of gender-based violence (GBV) persist. Other forms of violence experienced by women and girls include human trafficking and traditional practices such as harmful and demeaning widowhood rites and incarceration in camps as “witches”.   
Poverty is most concentrated among food crop farmers who are primarily women, as well as in the informal economy, where women predominate. Gender discrimination in access to services and distribution of resources can be a barrier to their productivity. Gender differences in access to economic opportunities arise in part because women are “time poor” due to their responsibilities for household and unpaid care work. Other constraints to women’s economic empowerment include lack of physical and financial capital, and weak property and inheritance rights. 
Government Response 
Government policies to ensure that “no one is left behind” are in the following priority areas: 
a) Strengthening social protection; 
b) Responding to challenges in the informal economy; 
c) Strengthening child protection; 
d) Addressing health inequity;  
e) Improving access to water and sanitation; 
f) Improving support to persons with disability; 
g) Accelerating progress on gender equality and empowerment of women and girls;  
h) Addressing inequities in access  and quality of education; 
i) Advancing the decent work and job-creation agenda; 
j) Protecting the aged. 
Strengthening Social Protection 
The Social Protection Policy (2015) aims to ensure that social protection programmes and services for vulnerable groups are well coordinated and strengthened. It is envisaged that by 2030, poverty will fall by half through increased and improved social assistance for poor and vulnerable Ghanaians. Employment opportunities will be considerably enhanced through the promotion of productive inclusion and decent work to sustain families and communities, while social security and social insurance will be increased and improved for all Ghanaians. 
Other ongoing efforts include: 
• Enacting a National Social Protection Law which will establish a Social Protection Floor to provide a legal basis for the country’s flagship social protection programmes and prioritising expenditure for social protection;  
• Linking vulnerable groups, including beneficiaries of existing social protection interventions, to productive and financial inclusion initiatives; and 
• Establishing the Ghana National Household Registry (GNHR) to guide the targeting for poverty alleviation interventions and reducing duplication of targeting mechanisms. 
Responding to Challenges in the Informal Economy 
Efforts to respond to the challenges present in the informal economy include: 
• Strengthening the institutional arrangements for supporting small- and medium-size enterprise and merging the National Board for Small-Scale Industries (NBSSI) and the Rural Enterprises Project (REP);  
• Sustainably expanding financial inclusion by deepening the reach of financial services, improving financial literacy, especially among youth and women in the informal sector; and improving access to finance by informal sector operators and agricultural enterprises in the rural areas; 
• Implementing the National Identification System to facilitate tracking of both formal and informal enterprises. 
Strengthening Child Protection 
To strengthen child protection, the following measures are being pursued: 
• The Children’s Act, 1998 (Act 560); Ghana’s Child and Family Welfare Policy (2014); Justice for Children’s Policy (2015); the National Strategic Framework for Ending Child Marriage (2016); the National Plan of Action II on Child Labour (2017-2021);   
• Developing and operationalising a Child Protection Management Information System for data capture and monitoring, including of street children and child beggars; 
• Provision of vocational training and shelters for street children  
Addressing Health Inequity  
Strategies to improve health access and advance universal health coverage include: strengthening the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS); accelerating implementation of the Mental Health Strategy and Law; paying special attention to maternal and child health services, nutrition services and communicable diseases; and ensuring sustainable healthcare financing arrangements that protect the poor. Investments in the community-based health planning and services (CHPS) programme in deprived areas are intended to address the long distances that many Ghanaians travel to receive health care.  
Improving Access to Water and Sanitation 
In 2018, the Ministry of Sanitation and Water Resources, in coordination with key stakeholders, produced guidelines for targeting the poor and vulnerable for basic sanitation services, reflecting the cross-sectoral approach required to address the issue. The national development agenda prioritises investments in sanitation, including encouraging private sector participation in sanitation service provision; establishing a National Sanitation Fund; and promoting a National Total Sanitation Campaign. Other initiatives include implementing the “Toilet for All” and “Water for All” programmes under the Infrastructure for Poverty Eradication Programme (IPEP).  
Improving Support to Persons with Disability 
Ghana’s Persons with Disability Act, 2006 (Act 715) is the legal framework for protecting persons with disabilities, including with regard to access to public infrastructure. This law needs to be implemented fully. The Government launched the Ghana Accessibility Standards for the Built Environment in 2016 to enhance access to public facilities.  Other policies work to enable children with special needs to have full access to education. The Inclusive Education Policy (2010) is intended to ensure delivery and management of education services that respond to the diverse needs of all learners. Other provisions in the Education Strategic Plan (2010-2020) aim to provide access to basic education for all children. 
Persons with disabilities (PWDs) are also a key target group for productive inclusion interventions in the social protection sector.  A key strategic action outlined in the National Employment Policy is to institute measures to ensure that PWDs are fully mainstreamed into the labour market in accordance with the Labour Act and related laws.  
Accelerating Progress on Gender Equality and Empowerment of Women and Girls  
The medium-term national development policy framework commits to legislation and enforcement of fair pay, equitable conditions of service and promotions in both the formal and informal sectors, while ensuring that women’s access to, participation in and benefits from all occupations are protected. The framework also commits to introducing measures to provide equal access and title to land for both men and women, and passing into law the Affirmative Action Bill. The Bill seeks to increase women’s participation in decision making, specifically targeting a minimum of 40 percent representation of women in politics and public office.   
Other national policies are either gender-focused or contain gender equality considerations. These include the National Strategic Framework on Ending Child Marriage; Child and Family Welfare Policy; Social Protection Policy; National Ageing Policy; Early Childhood Care Development Policy; Justice for Children Policy; the Domestic Violence Act; and the Human Trafficking Act.  
There are policy actions to promote women’s economic empowerment and enhance women’s participation in the labour market.  These include assignment of government-sponsored poverty alleviation funds and micro-finance and small loans to women. There is a strong focus on female head porters (kayayei) in the national development framework including improved access to education, healthcare and skills training in income-generating activities.  
Addressing Inequities in Access to Education / Quality of Education 
The Government is committed to inclusive and equitable education, as well as improving educational outcomes for all segments of the population. It is implementing the Free Public Senior High School (SHS) programme as its flagship intervention to improve equitable access to quality education. Efforts continue to be made to improve pre-tertiary education, with emphasis on expanding technical and vocational education and training (TVET) for all students as an alternative track for the youth.  
Advancing the Decent Work and Job-Creation Agenda 
The creation of more decent jobs is at the heart of the national development agenda.  Priority interventions include improving the business environment, as well as formalising the informal economy. Formalisation processes will include enforcing labour laws and regulations; strengthening the linkages among social protection and employment services; and enhancing livelihoods and entrepreneurship.  Skills training and internships are to be provided to support the school-to-work transition. Coordinated approaches to eliminating child labour are also priorities.    
Protecting the Aged 
The government of Ghana has in place a National Ageing Policy to ensure that the aged live in security and dignity. The medium-term policy in support of the aged includes establishing the Ageing Council; enacting the National Ageing law; and enhancing geriatric healthcare through training, access to health facilities and affordable services.   
 
 
 

	5.3 	Synergies and Trade-Offs For Ghana in the SDGs 
The SDGs provide opportunities to address different dimensions of development and taken together, important synergies can be derived. Similarly, the quest to achieve some targets may involve making trade-offs where actions to achieve one target may limit effectiveness in achieving others. In the quest to Leave no one behind, there is the need to take advantage of the synergies and reduce the risk involved in trade-offs.  
The 17 goals form a holistic interactive system that addresses key systemic barriers to all four pillars of sustainable development. The attainment of the SDGs will greatly depend on whether synergies can be leveraged and trade-offs that undermine other SDGs identified and tackled (Pradhan, 2017). 
The Government has supported cross-sectoral interactions and multi-stakeholder efforts that drive net-positive outcomes from synergies and trade-offs among the SDGs. These interventions were interdependent with others and reinforced achievement of selected indicator targets. Some policy processes, interventions and actions intended to lead to the achievement of the SDGs targets, potentially imposed constraints on other indicators, suggesting trade-off situations.

Synergies 	between 	SDGs 
1,2,3,8, 9, 13 and 15 in the agriculture sector have been demonstrated in the Planting for Export and Rural Development (PERD) programme being implemented by the Local Government and Rural 
Development (MLGRD) and Food and Agriculture (MoFA) ministries. PERD seeks to develop nine commodity value chains including cashew, coffee, cotton coconut, citrus, oil palm, mango, rubber and shea through a decentralised system. Ultimately, PERD will promote rural economic growth (SDG 8) and improve household incomes of rural farmers (SDG 1, 2, 3). PERD will also support sustainable raw material bases to spur the industrialisation drive (SDG 9), with implications for climate change and life on land (SDG 13 and SDG 15).  
 
 
Synergies 	between 	SDGs 
Research work by Zhou et al. (2018) from the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) on synergies and trade-offs among infrastructure-related SDG targets to guide interventions and support the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) to identify, elaborate and prioritise potential solutions as policy/project directions. The study focused on urban-rural linkages in Ghana and the key sustainability issues and challenges. Their work showed strong synergies among SDG 6, 7 and 17 with trade -offs on SDG 3, 7 and 8. To minimise the trade-off effects, proposals for coordination, policy coherence and targeted resource allocation were advocated.  
In the Ghanaian VNR process, network analysis was employed to investigate the synergies and trade-offs among all 17 SDGs. Interventions across sectors were explored to assess their impact on synergies while at the same time, reducing risk associated with trade-offs among SDGs interventions and ensuring economically, environmentally and socially sustainable development efforts. The network analysis identified clusters of synergies among SDG targets and maximised the positive connections inside the clusters. The analysis also pointed to opportunities for mitigating the effects of trade-offs, and contributing to inter-agency coordination, learning and dialogue.  
Some synergies among the SDGs that offer opportunities for inter-agency coordination, learning and dialogue may include: 
• SDG 1 (No poverty) has synergetic relationships with all the other SDGs but particularly strong synergies can be identified between it and SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 3 (good health and wellbeing), SDG 4 (quality education), 
SDG 6 (access to quality drinking water) and SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) because of the multidimensional nature of poverty.  
• There is a strong correlation between energy, water 

and food. Energy (SDG 7) is required to power irrigation systems (SDG 6) for food production (SDG 2.1-2.4). 
• In relation to SDG 2, the Government’s flagship programme, Planting for Food and Jobs, demonstrates strong synergies between SDG 2 (reflected in Targets 2.1 and 2.2) and SDG 8 and SDG 1 (reflected in Indicators 1.1.1, 1.2.1, and 8.1.1).  
• The Ghana Household Energy Project addresses SDG 7 (access to clean energy), SDG 3 (reduction in indoor air pollution diseases), particularly for women (SDG 5), minimising deforestation and loss of biodiversity (SDG 15) and reducing risk with climate change (SDG 13). 
 
However, there are trade-offs in land expansion in the agriculture sector. If sustainable agriculture intensification measures are not employed, there will be loss of biodiversity (SDGs 14 and15) and pollution of water bodies (SDG 6). 
• Abusive use of agro-chemicals and inefficient irrigation practices in food production systems (SDG2) have trade-off effects on SDG 14, SDG 15, SDG 3 and SDG 12.  
• Bad agricultural practices such as bush burning will impact negatively on climate change mitigation (SDG13). 
• Anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (Indicator 9.4.1) from inefficient energy use indicate the need for urgent action to combat climate change and its impact (SDG13) and promotion of renewable energy sources such as solar-powered systems. However, expansion in irrigation, particularly solar, has trade-offs in the long term with groundwater depletion in parts of Ghana.  
• SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) has a lot of trade-off implications. Hence resource use efficiency should be well integrated into development plans. 
Social Protection Intervention Programmes and SDGs 
Social protection initiatives such as the Livelihood Empowerment against Poverty (LEAP) demonstrate synergies between SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 10.  LEAP, which is a cash transfer programme for extremely poor and vulnerable households, targets three categories of people: orphaned and vulnerable children; persons with severe disability; and elderly persons (65 years and above). Based on the understanding that poverty and vulnerability are multi-dimensional, interventions associated with LEAP aim to increase enrolment in schools, improve attendance and retention among children of LEAP households, improve access to healthcare, insurance and skills building (see Box A1). 
 

Box: A1: A typical success story of the LEAP programme 
Aneba Awumtumyiga, is a beneficiary of the LEAP programme in the Wurania community in the Kassena Nankana West District, Upper East Region. Aneba, through the LEAP programme, was able to acquire dressmaking skills  which enabled her to save money for livestock rearing, repair her crutches and support her younger sister’s education. 
 	 

Actions to Strengthen Synergies and Mitigate Trade-Offs 
Capacity building  
Public sector functionaries in particular urgently need critical skills in coordination, especially in inter-ministerial development planning and implementation of programmes and projects. Training in systems approaches and trans-disciplinary initiatives would also facilitate this approach.  
Technology and data to drive improvement  
Reporting on synergies and trade-offs requires time-series data for quantitative analysis that complements qualitative narratives.  This involves easy access to reliable and credible data, and investment in technology for effective data collection, analysis, storage and management.  
Institutional strengthening for effective monitoring, evaluation and learning (MEL) 
Strengthening monitoring, evaluation and learning capacities for key institutions are essential. Relevant data should be available for public scrutiny and regular updating, with robust systems for information sharing of qualitative as well as quantitative data.   
Vertical integration and synergies among SDGs and multi-level governance   
Vertical and horizontal policy integration and coherence are critical to leveraging synergies. In view of this, alignment and coordination needs to be strengthened across different sectors and levels of governance to jointly formulate and implement sustainable development strategies.  
 
 
 	 
Policy Coherence and Interlinkages 
Multi-stakeholder and cross-sectoral engagement in policy development and implementation is a key prerequisite for policy coherence. Such engagement helps in mainstreaming the different dimensions of sustainable development and the consideration of synergies across SDGs. Ghana’s medium-term national development policy framework (2018-2021) was prepared through participatory processes, principally through the engagement of Cross-Sectoral Planning Groups (CSPGs) comprising representatives of the public sector, private sector, civil society, academia, the media, think-tanks, faith-based organisations and other identifiable groups. Sectoral policies are typically developed through participatory processes and programmes to address critical challenges that are multi-dimensional in nature. For example, in tackling the menace of illegal small-scale mining which has been destroying forests and polluting water bodies, an Inter-ministerial Committee on Illegal Mining (IMCIM) was established. The Committee developed the Multilateral Mining Integration Project (MMIP), which is a multi-sectoral action plan that addresses the root causes of unsustainable small-scale mining.   
There is a growing recognition that a different approach will be required in integrating the sustainability principles in tackling development issues.  For instance, “closing the loop” in sanitation and waste-water management (with a focus on recovery and reuse) can produce benefits including food and water security, climate mitigation, as well as opportunities for livelihoods and businesses.  Similarly, tackling solid waste goes beyond the traditional linear focus on collecting and dumping it.  Ghana’s Ministry of Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation (MESTI) is piloting the use of a multi-stakeholder Waste Recovery Platform in partnership with UNDP to promote a change in mindset, bring different government agencies to address data and policy issues. It also encourage investment in waste recovery and job creation, including integration of informal sector actors in formal waste value chains. 
It is important to proactively enhance vertical (e.g. between different levels of governance) and horizontal (e.g. across sectors) policy coherence and deepen the practice of appropriately incorporating all the dimensions of sustainability in development plans, policies and programmes. Often, the emphasis given to each of the dimensions of sustainability tends to vary. For instance, in the Planting for Food and Jobs (PFJ) programme, the focus on sustainable agriculture is not as strong as the focus on productive inclusion. Also, the potential synergies between agricultural waste recovery in the context of One district, one factory which could drive the production of organic manure for sustainable agriculture in the PFJ have not been fully explored even though they could increase the sustainability of both programmes.   
Many policy interventions include the focus on the dimensions of sustainability but lack the kind of input-output analytics that are required to identify the scale of impact, as well as that of synergies and trade-offs. In this regard, there has been some focus on strengthening capabilities across multiple MDAs to use modelling tools for sustainable development to identify where the trade-offs and synergies lie. 
A related dimension that Ghana is actively pursuing is the engagement of the private sector. If the private sector does not actively integrate sustainability principles in its business operations, SDGs targets such as those for sustainable production and consumption, and climate change mitigation and adaptation cannot be achieved. The Private Enterprise Federation (PEF) is an active partner in Ghana’s SDGs implementation processes, as well as the Green Economy and Climate Change steering committees. There is also growing emphasis on promoting private sector investment and engagement in the context of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to address climate change. At the Africa Climate Week, held in Accra in March 2019, the Government and UNDP jointly organised the Investment Forum on Ghana's NDCs.  
 
 
 

CONCLUSIONS AND NEXT STEPS 
Lessons from the Consultations and Review Meetings on Communicating the SDGs  
The consultations and review meetings revealed that a significant proportion of the population lacks adequate knowledge of the SDGs. There is therefore an urgent need to expand the current awareness-creation efforts using institutions with access to communities and grassroots populations across the country. The National Commission on Civic Education (NCCE), Information Services Department, community radio, the CSOs Platform and the District Oversight Committees of the National African Peer Review Mechanism Governing Council (NAPRM-GC) provide Ghana with important resources and platforms for expanding awareness of the SDGs. 
Effective implementation of the SDGs requires adequate capacity at local authority level to engage with local communities and other stakeholders. This implies that the capacity of District Assembly members and Members of Parliament must be enhanced for effective engagement with their constituents. The strategy for engagement should aim at developing effective collaborations with coalitions, representative organisations and umbrella bodies that can reach those who would ordinarily not be engaged such as people with disabilities, migrants, and confined persons (inmates of refugee camps, ‘witches’ camps, mental institutions, prisons and religious settlements). More engagement is required with disaggregated groups such as young people, women and older persons, and different income groups. Creative use of social media and traditional forms of information dissemination will serve as an important tool for reaching a wider proportion of the population. Financing, Business Case Development and Strengthening SDGs-Related Philanthropy  
Sustainable financing is critical in the realisation of the SDGs. Beyond alignment with the national budget, the financing gap requires that a business case be made to connect private enterprise, social entrepreneurship, innovation and research.  
Currently, the private sector provides corporate social responsibility. However corporate philanthropy, which is a potential source of funding for development projects both at the national and community levels, remains underexploited. The SDGs Philanthropy Platform will be supported to create opportunities for leveraging online funding, crowd funding and venture philanthropy particularly for the social enterprise sector.  
Strengthening the Research Agenda and Linkages between Research Institutions, Government Agencies, Private Sector and Other Stakeholders 
Implementing the SDGs and promoting the “Leaving No One Behind” agenda requires strong research capacity and output. Currently, a lot of qualitative and quantitative information of varying quality is generated in Ghana. However, these efforts are not coordinated sufficiently across research institutions and academia as well as with GSS. Efforts to promote quality assurance of CSO products are important but greater awareness of quality standards is needed among data producers and users.  
Information dissemination remains limited, including packaging research results for consumption by the private sector and development organisations, as well as the use of research findings by MDAs to strengthen evidence-based policy making and review. Priority policy action should be taken to communicate research findings and commercialise research products using special platforms to showcase them and their potential value. Stronger linkages between CSOs and research institutions will be encouraged to enhance tracking and accountability. 
There must be intensified effort to enhance research capacity related to the SDGs and their indicators among university students and staff; as well as implementers at the sub-national levels. 
The potential contribution of universities to the delivery of SDGs has gained the necessary recognition and therefore requires coordinated efforts to promote interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research approaches.  
Private Sector Engagement and Involvement 
The role of the private sector in attaining the SDGs is critical and a number of private sector entities have begun retooling to operate sustainably in support of the SDGs. The Private Enterprise Federation (PEF) is providing leadership and coordination in this regard.  The CEOs Forum on the SDGs, established by President Akufo-Addo, will serve as an additional platform for mobilising investments and coordinating implementation of the SDGs. 
Promoting Participation of Faith-Based Organisations in the Attainment of the SDGs 
Faith-based organisations (FBOs) have a unique role in the implementation of the SDGs on account of their perceived moral influence and far-reaching presence across the country which will allow them to disseminate information, encourage local ownership and generate micro-level insight and impact. FBOs also implement programmes and projects which have the potential to contribute to the achievement of the SDGs. To optimise the opportunities provided by FBOs, key coordinating entities will continue to be engaged on SDGs-related activities at local, sub-national and national levels.  
Mainstreaming Inclusion of Children’s Issues in National Development 
Ghana’s youthful population requires that the nation invests meaningfully in sustainable child development and reduces child poverty. Monetary child poverty is estimated to have remained unchanged between 2013 and 2017, but a significant proportion of children suffer from at least three of the eight dimensions of child poverty. This requires urgent action from stakeholders to tackle the root causes of multidimensional child poverty. 
Strengthening Local Government Capacity 
Though the SDGs have been mainstreamed in district medium-term development plans (DMTDP), capacity for implementation, monitoring and evaluation is relatively low. Ghana is thus making efforts to strengthen local-level planning, monitoring and implementation capacity by recruiting more local government staff, particularly statisticians. These efforts must be consolidated with effective, tailor-made training through the Regional Coordinating Councils (RCCs).
