Executive Summary 
Country context 
The Government of Sierra Leone (GoSL) is strongly committed to the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (the UN SDGs) that succeeded the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The new agenda conveys renewed commitment by the UN to support global paths to sustainable development by 2030. The previous agenda, the MDGs, provided useful benchmarks that the government strove very hard to achieve despite Sierra 
Leone‟s weak start at the dawn of the 21st century due to a devastating decade-long civil war (1991-2001) that crippled the economy and human development.   
 
Unfortunately, while the government was staying the course of pursuing the MDGs to the end, the nation was struck by yet another devastating crisis, the outbreak of the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in May 2014. The disease killed an estimated 3,500 of about 8,000 infected persons. It caused unprecedented damage to the social and economic fabric of the country before it was officially declared over on 7th November 2015. This human catastrophe was exacerbated by a coincidental crisis in the mining sector. As the disease was raging, the international price of the country‟s leading export commodity (iron ore) was crashing, compelling the two leading mining companies of the mineral to suspend operations for at least a year during 2014-2015. 1 The economy phenomenally plunged during the twin crises. Growth in GDP decelerated from 15.2 percent in 2012 and 20.1 percent in 2013 to 4.6 percent in 2014. 2 The estimated growth for end2015 was minus 21.1 percent. Consumer prices skyrocketed and at least 2.3 million people had their livelihoods worsened during these crises.  
 
The combined effects of the twin crises badly affected progress towards meeting the MDGs, and undermined hopes of achieving the country‟s Vision 2035 of becoming a middle income country, anchored on the successive implementation of its poverty reduction strategy papers (PRSPs), the current one dubbed the Agenda for Prosperity (A4P, 2013-2018). These effects have continued to linger on to date, to the extent that the government is currently instituting tough austerity measures to revamp the economy. 
 
Progress on the MDGs 
Before the EVD struck in 2014, Sierra Leone had made progress in implementing the MDGs by, among others, integrating its goals in the national development plans, including the PRSP III/A4P. Two MDG reports had so far been prepared (2005 and 2010) and the country received a UN MDGs award in 2010 in recognition of the President‟s remarkable leadership commitment and progress towards achieving MDG 6. Various socio-economic surveys and sector reports indicated notable progress towards achieving a number of MDGs and the country was optimistic that several goals would have been achieved in 2015. Poverty headcount had declined from 70 percent in 2003, to 52.9 percent in 2013; prevalence of underweight children reduced from 20 percent in 2004, to 16 percent in 2013; primary school completion rate stood at 76 percent in 2013; the ratio of girls to boys in primary school was close to 100 percent; HIV/AIDS prevalence dropped from 1.5 percent in 2005, to 0.12 percent in 2015; access to safe drinking water increased from 36.7 percent in 1990, to 62.6 percent in 2015; and mobile cellular subscribers increased from 14.3 percent in 2007, to 76.7 percent in 2014. A draft 2015 MDGs progress report has been prepared. This end-programme report and various socioeconomic assessments including the Ebola Recovery Strategy show that the EVD reversed gains made in achieving several MDGs.  Indeed, serious challenges remained in a number of other areas, especially in reducing maternal and child mortality. In 2013, maternal mortality rate was 1,165 deaths per 100,000 live births (1.17 percent) and under-five and infant mortality rates were 156 and 92 deaths per 1,000 births (15.6 and 9.2 percent), respectively. Huge room also remained for improving the protection of the environment and enhancing sanitation and hygiene. 
 
 
Challenges and lessons going forward  
A number of challenges have emerged for Sierra Leone in the light of recent socioeconomic developments and their implications for the need to foster regional and global cooperation to ensure sustainable development. Poverty, vulnerability and inequality remain a concern. Additionally, to the extent that Sierra Leone could phenomenally suffer a cross-border infection to a monumental scale as witnessed with the Ebola virus, which originated from the Republic of Guinea, cements the fact that the regional and global dimension of a country‟s sustainable development cannot be overemphasized.    
 
Sierra Leone‟s economy remains fragile and vulnerable to external shocks. It is highly dependent on mining for foreign exchange earnings, which are unpredictable as corroborated in the recent crash of international price of its leading export commodity (iron ore), suggesting that the country must diversify its economy to grow and develop sustainably.  
 
Natural disasters are a continuous threat to the country. Recent disasters included massive flooding that decimated homes, business premises and claimed scores of lives in the capital city of Freetown and other regions just as the country was emerging from the scourge of the Ebola epidemic in August 2015, thus speaking highly to the need for SDG11 that warns states to ensure efficient management of towns, cities and population.  
 
Related to the foregoing is the increasing evidence of the negative effects of climate change, including rising sea levels and frequent flooding. Sierra Leone has been recently reported to be among the most vulnerable countries to the effects of climate change in the world. 2 Addressing these threats requires sustained development cooperation and investing in attitudinal and behavioural change in consumption and production patterns, as well as in climate change-related disaster preparedness, such as early warning systems, and prevention planning.  
 
Other challenges include management of regional conflicts that require member countries‟ participation, such as responding to cross-border organized crime; terrorism; piracy; drugs and human trafficking; and illicit financial flows depriving Africa of scarce development resources. Youth unemployment requires greater attention in the pursuit of social stability and increasing capacity to administer justice.  
 
Leaving no one behind 
The domestication of SDGs in Sierra Leone has taken into consideration the principle of leaving no one behind, as this is an additional dimension to the special context and challenges the country faces, which require adequate response in fulfillment of this principle.  Accordingly, SDGs consultations and popularization process has taken into consideration marginalized and excluded groups, including persons with disabilities, women in rural areas, children, youth and the incarcerated, as well as households in informal settlements.  Statistics Sierra Leone and other government agencies are being sensitized to collect disaggregated (including spatial) data that enable effective policy making and tracking of relevant inequalities. Furthermore, upholding concerns relating to intergenerational environmental equity is crucial to the fulfillment of this objective; otherwise not only a huge cross-section of the present generation will be left behind but also, the sustained survival of those yet unborn could be doubtful. 
  
 What to do to overcome the challenges As gathered from the consultations, addressing these challenges requires development of a capable and effective state with sound institutions, accompanied by robust monitoring, early warning and response mechanisms to respond to risks and threats accordingly and building on acquired strengthens as well as applying critical lessons learned. Having a wellincentivized public and civil service system and a durable and robust peace infrastructure is all the more critical to ensuring sustainable development in the country; incentives that are accompanied by inculcation of integrity at work.    
 
Accession to the voluntary review and progress in adapting the SDGs in Sierra Leone  It is against the above background that Sierra Leone has seen the SDGs as a timely opportunity to overcome development challenges ahead. We have therefore volunteered for the review at the July 2016 High Level Political Forum (HLPF) of the progress that Sierra Leone has made in integrating the SDGs into our national development processes.  
 
So far, we have published a simplified version of the SDGs, distributed copies to Parliament as well as the general public; and provided briefing to Cabinet. These have been followed by series of sensitization meetings and workshops with civil society and Non-Governmental 
Organizations, the local councils, a cross-section of university colleges, and the general public through radio and TV discussions. The Office of the President provides broad oversight to the SDGs adaptation process, while the Ministries of Finance and Economic Development and that of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation provide operational, technical and diplomatic leadership.  
 
The SDGs were integrated into the 2016 National Budget, and have been aligned to the Eight Pillars of Sierra Leone‟s third generation poverty reduction strategy paper. Technical workshops were organized to prepare Sierra Leone‟s SDGs adaptation report, which constitute the review report to present to the HLPF in July. A draft set of SDG indicators specific to Sierra Leone have been formulated.  
 
 	 

1. Introduction 
1.1 Background and Justification of the SDGs   Sierra Leone implemented the MDGs during 2000-2015. The Goals were operationalized within the framework of the country‟s national development plans, such as the poverty reduction strategy papers (PRSPs), which have been implemented since the end of the civil war in 2002.  
 
In May 2014, towards the end of the MDGs, the country was struck by the Ebola virus disease (EVD), killing more than 3,500 people out of more than 8000 infection cases. The disease caused unprecedented socioeconomic damage before it was officially declared over on 7th November 2015. While women and children were the most affected, the most worrying situation was the high death toll the disease inflicted on our very limited population of health workers, killing 221 out of 296 infected doctors, nurses and other health personnel; 11 specialist doctors were among those lost.  
 
Sierra Leone had generally recorded positive achievements in the implementation of the MDGs in a range of development areas. The MDGs Progress Report 2015 shows that the poverty headcount had declined from 70 percent in 2003, to 52.9 percent in 2013; prevalence of underweight children reduced from 20 percent in 2004, to 16 percent in 2013; primary school completion rate stood at 76 percent in 2013; the ratio of girls to boys in primary school was close to 100 percent; HIV/AIDS prevalence dropped from 1.5 percent in 2005, to 0.12 percent in 2015; access to safe drinking water increased from 36.7 percent in 1990, to 62.6 percent in 2015; and mobile cellular subscribers increased from 14.3 percent in 2007, to 76.7 percent in 
2014.3 (See Table 1.) 
 
At the same time, not all MDGs targets have recorded desired progress, including the areas of fighting rural poverty prevalence (which is still close to 70 percent); child mortality (under-five and infant mortality rates recorded 156 and 92 deaths per 1,000 births in 2013, respectively); and maternal mortality (recorded 1,165 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2013); although these mortality rates are considerably better than they were in 2000, when under-five, infant and maternal mortality rates were recorded at 286, 
170 and 1800 deaths, respectively.4  
 
The following challenges have especially emerged for the country in light of recent socioeconomic developments vis-à-vis realities across the entire world:    
• Poverty, vulnerability and inequality continue to remain a serious concern. These could have been seriously exacerbated by the one and a half years of devastation caused by the Ebola virus disease.  
• Sierra Leone was hit by twin crises during 2014-2015: while the EVD was raging, the international price of the country‟s leading export commodity (iron ore) was coincidentally crashing, compelling the two leading mining companies of the mineral to suspend operations. The twin crises saw the economy plummet from a GDP growth of 15.2 percent in 2012, and 20.1 percent in 2013, to about 7 percent in 2014 (from an estimated 11.3 percent for 2014 at the beginning of the year before EVD). 5 Additionally, it was projected to grow by minus 23.5 by the end of 2015. 
 	 

 	 


• National prices skyrocketed owing to over-dependence on international market for local consumption and production, while both air and sea transport was extremely disrupted during the epidemic. The message is that, the country cannot grow and develop sustainably without meaningfully diversifying the economy.  
• Natural disasters—such as health and environmental calamities—continue to occur at alarming proportion in the world. Sierra Leone is not an exception in this context, with the recent examples of (i) the Ebola epidemic of 2014-2015, and (ii) flooding disaster that decimated homes and claimed scores of lives in the capital of Freetown in September 2015.  
• Evidence of negative effects of climate change is increasingly becoming clear— sea levels are rising; massive floods are becoming more frequent; and we are fast losing life in our surrounding environment including plants and animals that are extremely important for our survival. Sierra Leone is reported to be the third most vulnerable country to effects of climate change, after Bangladesh and Guinea-Bissau.6 In fact, emerging anecdotal evidence has it that Sierra Leone has descended to the second position from the bottom.8   
• Civil conflicts continue to remain widespread; and terrorism, piracy, and drugs and human trafficking are all becoming constant problems across the globe. Sierra Leone continues to be considered a fragile state, prone to suffering from the effects of these global problems. 
• In addition to the effects of global financial crises that badly expose weak and donor dependent countries, illicit financial flows are increasing and causing substantial economic losses for least developed nations like Sierra Leone. 
• A lot remains to be desired with governance systems across the world: as wars continue to rage in various parts of the globe, millions continue to be displaced, leading to growing refugee and illegal migrant crises. While Sierra Leone is increasingly recording desired ratings in good governance and peace, it remains vulnerable to the effects of poor governance, conflicts and terrorism in other countries.   
Therefore, the Government of Sierra Leone is not oblivious of the endless opportunities presented by the SDGs, which have been launched as the new UN global development Agenda put together to succeed the MDGs. They are meant to build on and address the unfinished business of the MDGs, and confront these emerging challenges. The new agenda was adopted by all 193 Member States of the UN on 25th September 2015 in New York. With 17 Goals and 169 targets, it will be implemented for another 15 years, starting from January 2016 and ending in December 2030. The new agenda provides an enhanced platform for international development cooperation and engagement to resolve these problems, a platform that fragile states such as Sierra Leone can increasingly leverage for international assistance to walk them out of fragility onto a sustainable path to prosperity.   
1.2 Objective of the Report  
The objective of this report is to inform the United Nations about the progress Sierra Leone has made in sensitizing stakeholders to the new goals and in adapting them to national development processes. It specifically provides status of initial steps undertaken by the 

government to domestically implement the SDGs. It is submitted in response to UN‟s request to Member States wishing to be reviewed at the first High Level Political Forum (HLPF) on progress made in domesticating the SDGs in July 2016 in New York to forward such reports. 
1.3 Process of Domesticating the SDGs and 
Report Preparation     
The process was guided by the leading principle of Agenda 2030 (the SDGs) and the theme of the July 2016 HLPF, which is leaving no one behind. Among the key elements of this is ensuring broad participation and inclusiveness in the development process by all. The SDGs adaptation process in Sierra Leone has strictly followed this since September 2015. The country is broadly divided into four regions: the North, South, East and West, all housing 14 districts. Consultations were held at regional level, drawing participants from these districts, while others were organized at the national level in the capital of Freetown.  
 
Consultations were led by government institutions as well as non-governmental organizations on the SDGs. The government engaged middle to high-level officials from the public service, parliament, local government, the private sector, trade unions, civil society/nongovernmental organizations and universities. A segment of these actors, especially those from the trade unions, the private sector, CSOs and NGOs, were engaged to ensure onward dissemination of information on the goals to lower level development actors, including the local communities. Interactive radio and TV discussions were organized to reach out to the general public.  
 
Key topics discussed during public, regional and national engagements are as follows: 
• What the SDGs are and their general relevance to Sierra Leone 
• How were the SDGs prepared and who were involved in the preparation process 
• The relevance of the SDGs to Sierra Leone‟s socioeconomic development 
• What is meant by leaving no one behind and how do we achieve this 
• Ensuring effective balance between the three fundamental dimensions of sustainable development: social, economic and environmental dimensions 
• Integrating the goals into national development plans, including the Agenda for Prosperity and the National Ebola Recovery Strategy 
• Relevance of multidimensional approach to poverty measurement for the success of the SDGs 
• Data disaggregation and promotion of gender statistics recording and reporting 
• Harnessing Open Data Revolution for the SDGs in Sierra Leone 
• Rationalizing Sierra Leone international benchmarks to enhance efficient 
reporting on the SDGs    
• Challenges to the implementation of the SDGs in Sierra Leone 
• How can we make the SDGs better than the MDGs and what is the role of everyone in the process 
• Institutional arrangement for implementing the SDGs in Sierra Leone 
A range of workshops were organized across the country to undertake discussions and deliver SDG messages. These included a Data Revolution Roadmap for Sustainable Development Multi-Stakeholder National Workshop organized by the Right to Access Information Commission in Sierra Leone, drawing the participation of international partners. A coalition of CSOs and NGOs on the SDGs was formed and undertook community outreach programme to sensitize local communities on the new global agenda.   
 
In Government, the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development acts as the operational and technical lead in domesticating the SDGs, working in close collaboration with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, which provides diplomatic direction to the process, and the Office of the President, which provides broad policy and political oversight to national development processes.  
 
After intensive engagements with all relevant stakeholders including donor agencies, a national technical workshop was organized to validate and revise the country‟s Draft SDGs Adaptation Report submitted to the UN in December 2015. This has led to the production and submission of this final draft. Sierra Leone specific SDGs indicators were reviewed in the process, and baselines and targets were provisionally defined for indicators with available data (this will be discussed further below).  
 
The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) provided most of the financial support to this process. Additional support came through the UNDP from the Government of Kazakhstan to support Sierra Leone‟s preparation for participation at the HLPF.        
 
1.4 Limitation of the Review Report  
This report only provides broad framework to guide more intensive SDG processes ahead. It highlights key efforts that have been made so far in integrating the SDGs into local development processes and immediate actions to follow after the HLPF.  A lot more needs to be done in integrating the goals into the planning process. A set of indicators for the country has been drafted but more consultations need to be undertaken to firm them up and start intensive data collection to establish comprehensive baselines and targets. 
The baselines and targets that have been established so far will require further validation and agreement among stakeholders. This will be followed by undertaking a comprehensive SDGs needs-based assessment to inform the preparation of an SDGs Investment Plan for the country, so as to determine required resources to achieve targets by 2030.      
1.5 Organization of the Report The following sections present the major initial steps undertaken by the Government to integrate the SDGs into the national development process. Section II talks about the publication of simplified version of the SDGs, while III highlights efforts at linking the SDGs to the national policy regime.  Section IV talks about activities undertaken to create national ownership for the SDGs, while V describes the process of developing monitoring and evaluation system for the goals. Section VI describes the institutional arrangement for their implementation, VII concluding the report and highlighting next steps.   
 
2. Publication of Simplified Version of the SDGs  
The first and immediate step undertaken by GoSL in the domestication process was a public sensitization on the SDGs through the preparation of a simplified version of the new agenda, which was produced and published on 7th November 2015. This covers (i) the transitioning from the MDGs to the SDGs; (ii) the reasons for embarking on the SDGs and their preparation process; (iii) the remaining and emerging challenges to address in the world; (iv) the correlation between the SDGs and Sierra 
Leone‟s development priorities as defined in the country‟s current PRSP—the Agenda for Prosperity—which sets the baseline for achieving Sierra Leone‟s Vision 2035 of becoming a middle income country; and (v) how the SDGs are expected  to be implemented in 
Sierra Leone.7  
 
3. Linking the SDGs to National Policy Regime  
3.1 Three National Development Plans to Implement in Sierra Leone   
The PRSPs have been the overall national development framework Sierra Leone has implemented since the end of the civil war. It was implementing the third generation PRSP, the Agenda for Prosperity (A4P), 2013-2018, when the Ebola virus broke out. The extensive social and economic damage caused by the disease necessitated the formulation of the National Ebola Recovery Strategy (NERS), with the objective of (i) ending and sustaining zero Ebola infections; (ii) restoring socioeconomic services; and (iii) returning the economy back on the track of sustainable development with effective implementation of the A4P. The NERS was completed and launched in July 2015 and is implemented until June 2017. On 25th September, the UN SDGs were launched, with all Member States required to implement them domestically.  
 
Thus, Sierra Leone faces the challenge of simultaneous implementing three key strategies: the A4P (2013-2018); the NERS (2015-2017); and the SDGs (2016-2030); all of which are critical to the sustainable development of the country. While the three plans are crucially important, however, their simultaneous implementation requires an integrated approach in order to ensure coherent and coordinated address of the differentiated but interrelated objectives they respectively seek to achieve.          
3.2 The National Budget, Sierra Leone’s 
Agenda for Prosperity and the SDGs 
The SDGs constitute a major policy thrust in Sierra Leone‟s National Budget for 2016 Fiscal Year. The goals are aligned to each spending category of the Budget. In so doing, the Budget Statement has been able to start defining actors and their responsibilities for reporting on the SDGs within government MDAs competing for state resources and categorized under the various planned expenditure headings. An annex showing the link between the 17 SDGs and 169 targets and the Eight Pillars of the Agenda for Prosperity, mapping MDAs to the goals, is included in the 2016 Budget, and is reproduced in this report as Annex 1. A summary of the link between the SDGs and these pillars is presented in Table 2, reproduced from the SDGs simplified version (2015, p.4).   
 
As reflected in Table 2, in Sierra Leone, the SDGs are more or less a recast of the country‟s leading development plan, the A4P (2013-2018), a national agenda to roll out beyond 2018 on the road to achieving Vision 2035. This strongly suggests that the SDGs and the A4P are deeply intertwined.     
In March this year, the Head of Civil Service and Secretary to Cabinet issued a circular to all government MDAs to submit to his office existing sectoral policies and their alignment to the SDGs with a view to determining gaps in policy orientation towards the new global agenda that Sierra Leone was a signatory to. In April, a presentation on the SDGs to top management of the civil service and respective institutions was done to debate the role expected of the public sector in the implementation of the SDGs in Sierra Leone.

The following are highlights of broad areas the civil service is expected to work on to enhance the implementation of the SDGs in the country: 
 Sectoral policy and strategy alignment to the SDGs 
 Capacity development for preparation of bankable projects  
 Capacity development for implementation, monitoring and 
evaluation of  projects and programmes 
 
 
 
 
 
 Increasing incentive systems and motivation for civil servants 
 Enhancing implementation of existing public service reform programmes 
 Enhancing implementation of performance appraisal systems 
 Strengthening government attitudinal and behavioural change programme 
 Enhancing records management, access to information,  communication and technology development within the service 
 Introducing innovative means for mobilizing more domestic resources 
 Encouraging diaspora programme in the service to fill human capacity requirement 
 
4. Creating National Ownership for the SDGs 
 
4.1 Regional Consultations with Local 
Government Officials and CSOs and NGOs 
Operating at Provincial District Level These consultations, as those organized at the national level discussed below, provided relevant inputs into the national SDGs implementation planning process. Messages gathered from these discussions are summarized as follows: 
 
Leaving No One Behind 
• Political will is most critical to ensuring that no one is left behind in the implementation of the SDGS 
• It requires the government to create the enabling environment for every facet of society to be involved in the development process and be catered for   
• Requires conducting baseline assessments of the current socioeconomic and political status, using the 17 goals as a guide 
• Calls for sustained international engagement to ensure that the problems of the weak and most exposed states to vulnerabilities are addressed 
Making the implementation of the SDGs better than the MDGs’ 
• Late disbursement of funds from central government to local councils during the MDGs phase was noted as a major factor 
to overcome to ensure successful implementation of the SDGs 
• Given the country‟s current fragility context, it will be important for the government to prioritize among 
development priorities 
• While decentralization has been pursued since the end of the civil war in 2002, there is still recognition of centralized national development planning, such as related to the preparation of the National Ebola Recovery Strategy; this must be discouraged going forward with the SDGs 
• Noted the need to learn from the late start the country experienced with MDGs to ensure that plans are put together quickly to implement the SDGs 
• Recommended official launch of the 
SDGs at regional and district levels 
• Local councils to play central role in the coordination of implementation of the SDGs at local level 
• Step up the fight against corruption 
• Rationalize role of different ministries, departments and agencies to reduce duplication of functions in the public sector 
• Improve coordination and collaboration at all levels 
• Strengthen domestic revenue mobilization to reduce dependency on donor funds in financing the SDGs, explore innovative financing solutions and increase economic diversification 
• Establish an effective M&E framework 
• Lessons learned in the implementation of the MDGs be reviewed and incorperated into the implementation strategy of the 
SDGs 
 
4.2 Consultations at National Level with Central Government, Trade Unions, the Private Sector, CSOs, NGOs, the Universities, and the Donor Community    Substantial inputs to the SDGs process were made by representatives of these groups at national level. Intense debates involving panel and group discussions were organized.  
 
Discussions began in October 2015 with an engagement with a cross-section of CSOs and NGOs summoned by the then Minister of Finance and Economic Development. This initial engagement 	emphasized 	the 	continued challenges the world was facing, as the MDGs were coming to an end, and the opportunities the new global Agenda—the SDGs—was presenting to address these challenges, especially those affecting fragile states like Sierra Leone. It underscored the central role and responsibilities of CSOs in the implementation of the SDGs in Sierra Leone and the rest of the world. Box 1 provides a summary of critical areas that CSOs pointed out during the meeting requiring special attention in the implementation of the new global goals. Box 1 also gives a summary of agreed 
actions going forward.8 
 
These discussions were also centred on the key topics and themes that would guide efforts to achieve the targets set in Agenda 2030, such as the principle of leaving no one behind; ensuring balance between the social, environmental and economic 	dimensions 	of 	sustainable development; and delivering the SDGs to their full potential.  
 
The key messages from the discussions are summarized as follows.  
 
 
Leaving No One Behind  
Participation and socioeconomic inclusiveness  
• Government to develop detailed national engagement strategies on the SDGs that will carefully determine who to get involved in the process, and why they are important to communicate with, so as to generate optimum level of legitimacy and ownership to make the new agenda a success. 
• Engagement should be widespread, cutting across regional and political divide and concerns.   
• Prioritize the views of the vulnerable and minority groups, such as the physically challenged.  
• Youths constitute a great proposition of the population of Sierra Leone. But with many lacking the necessary capabilities (employability through enhanced education and training, for instance) to effectively participate in the labour market, there has been an inadvertent tendency to exclude them from active participation in formal economic activities.   
• Careful attention should be paid to the issue of youth development. From a long term development perspective, 
Government should sustain its efforts in increasing school enrolment and narrowing boy-girl ratio in school, ensuring that special focus is given to increasing retention of pupils in school; adult education be promoted; and intensification of vocational and technical education. 

 	 
Box 1: Outcome of the Initial Orientation Meeting between Civil Society Organizations and the then Minister of Finance and Economic Development in Freetown on 29th October 2015  
--------------- 
A: Key Concerns Raised by CSOs 
a. The civil society expressed series of concerns about the feasibility of achieving a range of SDGs. For instance, they expressed that it will be an uphill task to achieve SDGs 1 and 11—ending  poverty in all its forms everywhere and making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe resilient and sustainable— to which the Minister responded with optimism.   
b. They advised on the need to reflect on the successes and challenges of the MDGs as a starting point of the implementation of the SDGs. 
c. The need to ensure discipline, quality assurance and probity in the use of public resources were underscored as critical to the success of the SDGs and general development programmes.  
d. They emphasized the importance of performance contracts signed by Government ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs) as central in ensuring effectiveness in service delivery.  
B: Actions Going Forward with the SDGs 
a. Ministerial annual performance contracts should be drawn from the National Budget to which the SDGs are firmly linked. This is critical for the participation of CSOs in monitoring the new global agenda alongside national development plans.  
b. Government should strengthen local revenue mobilization with a greater focus on taxes to increase economic resilience.  
c. Strengthen project implementation capacity. 
d. Strengthen the operations and management of non-governmental organizations that handle a great proportion of development resources.   
e. Set-up and implement effective national monitoring and evaluation systems to effectively track and report on development progress.  
f. Clearly map all relevant MDAs and other stakeholders in relation to their roles and responsibilities in following up and reporting on SDGs progress.  
g. Strengthen and restructure academic, technical and vocational institutions, introducing specialized courses so as to meet contemporary skills demand by employers and to ensure international competitiveness.  
h. The achievement of a range of SDGs, such as those relating to the environment and climate change— 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15—are dependent on behavioural change. Thus, great attention should be given to sensitization of the SDGs, with emphasis on behavioral change.  
i. To nationally determine the investment needs to achieve the SDGs. 
k. To map all CSOs to the relevant SDGs falling under their respective programme areas to enhance their participation and follow up in the implementation.  
 

• Ensure that skills produced match demand in the labour market; fostering  cooperation between knowledge production institutions, employers, trade 
unions and government and nongovernment organizations in promoting skills alignment. 
• Short to medium term interventions to address youth unemployment could include establishment of youth farms at district level. 
• Promote public private partnership in ways that will include small scale economic operators, encouraging backward and forward linkages and their involvement in value chain development. 
• Women and girls constitute the majority, but still face unacceptable levels of exclusion in socioeconomic activities; a vast proportion of those engaged are unpaid, a situation more pronounced in the rural areas; thus affirmative action should be promoted while government sustains efforts at giving special support to girl child education. 
Disability issues and stigmatization   
• Persons with disabilities are noted with increased difficulty to access education and justice; need to interpret and enforce application of legislations covering the welfare of this vulnerable group. 
• Caring for the mentally challenged has left a lot to be desired, yet it has been reported across the world that a dollar spent on caring for mental challenges will engender far more than proportionate returns to economic growth and development. 
• Counter narratives are needed to reverse the negative stereotypes held on the situation of marginalized groups in general, including the sick.   
The incarcerated and the justice system in general  
• A major risk that fragile states face is the insufficient care paid to the imprisoned and remanded in correctional homes; many are remanded without indictment for several weeks, months and years, those eventually released not having a secure and sustainable livelihood in the absence of special interventions to rehabilitate their lives.  
• This is central in addressing the challenges facing the justice system as a cornerstone for the success of the SDGs. This makes the establishment of the Legal Aid Board in Sierra Leone a laudable venture by Government to pursue justice for these excluded groups, and to generally prevent dispensation of injustice from a proactive standpoint.  
• The hard-to-reach areas (especially the rural community) are especially prone to unjust acts and human rights abuses.  
• This requires promotion of non-formal justice systems, improving chieftaincy governance and community monitoring.      
Food insecurity and extreme poverty  
• Populations found in these conditions stand the risk of permanent deprivation with attendant negative impact on the development of children born into these circumstances. Coping strategies of such populations, for instance, can be detrimental to the environment through land degradation, deforestation and other negative activities.   
• Thus, increased efficiency in targeting poverty resources and monitoring of delivery is critical.  
Island and coastal communities 
• Great risks abound among populations living in these areas as a result of their exposure to effects of climate change induced sea level rises that would eventually engulf and sweep swaths of these communities.   
• Communities along the coast and slum settlements in low lying areas in the capital city, as well as those inhabiting hilltops/hillsides, run the risk of being swept by waters from torrential rains.    
Natural resource management and future generations  
• Leaving no one behind is very much linked to making efforts to creating optimal balance in the three dimensions of sustainable development: the social, economic and environmental dimensions presented below. This is particularly important in the light of the centrality of ensuring responsible use of natural resources to ensure sustainable development. 
• An approach that leaves no one behind must care for both the present and future generation. Young people and those yet unborn will be the future decision makers; thus their livelihoods should not be compromised by actions of the current decision-makers with regard to the use of natural resources.     
Data disaggregation 
• In all of the above, having efficient data system and dissemination was extensively discussed. 
• An efficient data system should carry capability to disaggregate data to the extent possible to adequately reveal contexts underlying development phenomena to inform policies, interventions and targeting.  
• There is serious concern over the continued gender differentials across socioeconomic spheres, leading to the special emphasis on the need to improve gender statistics collection and reporting. 
• It is generally argued that until it is known and known properly it will be difficult to address it correctly and sustainably. 
• There is need to undertake in-depth analyses of the structural, financial, political and social drivers of inequality and exclusion in the country. 
Balancing the Economic, Social and Environmental Dimensions of Sustainable 
Development 
 
The Government of Sierra Leone has been mindful of this interconnectedness, as confirmed in its current poverty reduction strategy paper, the Agenda for Prosperity, which can be broadly divided into economic, social, environmental and political governance dimensions. The A4P respects the need for this balance, which is conceptually presented in Figure 1. The Eight Pillars of the A4P fall across these sustainable development dimensions as shown in the figure. Pillars 1, 4 and 5 fall directly under the economic dimension; Pillar 2 the environmental dimension; Pillar 3, 6 and 8 the social dimension; and Pillar 7 under the political governance dimension. Indeed, sustainable development had been embedded in the national policy framework. What could be additionally needed is ensuring effective implementation of the respective interventions underlying these Eight Pillars in a manner that ensures balance and crossdimensional reinforcement in the four dimensions highlighted in the context of Sierra Leone.

 	 	Pillar 8: Gender & women‟s 	 empowerment Specific messages from the national consultations on these issues are summarized as follows: 
• It was acknowledged that the narrative on increasing the balance between the dimensions of sustainable development was pivotal to the leaving no one behind campaign. 
• Measures taken now to reduce land degradation will benefit present generations socio-economically through improved food security as well as providing the basis for sustainable food production for future generations.  
• Those taken by current generations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally and to build adaptive capacity locally will benefit present and future generations socioeconomically, and all put together can bring about good governance and political stability. 
• It was noted that no matter the level of GDP growth, it cannot be seen as development until the majority of society share in that growth through increased general employment accompanied by affordability of health services, education, and increased environmental  sanity and responsible exploitation of natural resource. 
• Improve environmental governance and increase use of environmental impact assessments and other policy monitoring instruments. 
• Increase the capacity of Sierra Leone‟s Environmental Protection Agency. 
• Increase collaboration and coordination among all actors, government MDAs and others whose operations or mandate have implications for the health of the environment and use of natural resources; rationalizing their functions where necessary to increase efficiency. 
• Increase enforcement of policies and legislations  
Delivering the SDGs to their full potential for the country 
• Incorporate lessons learned from the MDGs in the process of implementing the SDGs. 
• Stimulate private sector activities and diversify the economy, paying great attention to development and transformation of agriculture that engaged more than 70 percent of the national work force. 
• Strengthen role of civil society in the monitoring of prioritized actions for the SDGs, following up and reporting on this. 
• Explore innovative financing solution, and pursue appropriate mechanism to curb illicit financial flows. 
• Sustain and implement tax incentives for employers engaging women in top/managerial positions. 
• Increase coordination among actors within and between government institutions and non-governmental organizations including donor agencies. 
• Encourage research and ensure the full involvement of the university and research institutions in the implementation of the SDGs, drawing up programme of engagement in the areas of promoting science, technology and innovation locally and establishing partnerships with international groups in these areas for transfer of knowledge. 
• Improve overall national development coordination, reduce duplication of functions, and strengthen policy and programme implementation. 
• Increase capacity for development of bankable projects. 
• Incentivize civil servants to secure the minimum motivation necessary to effectively implement public programmes. Step up implementation of policies and programmes in this direction.    
• Implement findings of the national fragility assessment conducted by the UNDP and the Government. 
 
4.3 Consultation with Parliament Intensive discussions were held with a crosssection of members of parliament (MPs) drawn from the parliamentary committees on various socioeconomic sectors of the public service. Government‟s rapid response to integrating the SDGs into local planning processes was lauded by MPs, recalling the mounting problems such as climate change effects that Sierra Leone was enormously exposed to, and for which the new global agenda must be taken very seriously. General messages were documented from these discusses and are summarized as follows:  
 
• Climate change: a plethora of international protocols and treaties on climate change have been passed but much has not been done in terms of putting these frameworks into action. 
• Thus questions were asked as to how soon the international community and sub-regional organizations would be ready to put these frameworks into action and save the world from the catastrophic impact of climate change on lives and property. It was reported here that in fact Sierra Leone had descended further down from being third most exposed to climate change effects after Bangladesh and Guinea-Bissau, to the second most exposed, now.    
• It was noted that parliament was not well educated on climate change issues.  
• Attitudinal and behavioural change was highlighted as a fundamental ingredient to the success of the SDGs, on which combating certain activities like deforestation and improving environmental sanitation hinges.   
• The existence of high maternal mortality ratio in Sierra Leone was extensively debated. The need for special strategies to minimize these rates—as well as under-five and infant mortality ratios— was emphasized, noting that these issues transcend mainstream health sector, requiring improved household behaviour and attendant legislations and enforcement to improve good practices such as related to environment health, water, sanitation and hygiene.  
5. Process of Developing Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) System for the SDGs 
Sierra Leone is determined to develop a better system for monitoring and reporting for the SDGs that is multilayered but well-coordinated, integrated and self-reinforcing.  
 
The Role of the Ministry of Finance and 
Economic Development (MoFED) in the Process  Firstly, against the backdrop that there currently exist two key national development plans, the A4P and the NERS, it is prudent for the purpose of coherence and coordination that the annual (mostly process, activity and output) SDGs progress reporting be embedded in the monitoring and evaluation arrangement for the Agenda for Prosperity as the defining national plan, to which the National Ebola Recovery Strategy is also embedded. The A4P is the lead instrument for operationalizing the SDGs on the ground, therefore the first step led by MoFED was to review the three documents—the SDGs, A4P and the NERS—simultaneously, and draft an integrated results framework (IRF), aligning the SDGs and the NERS to the monitoring and evaluation framework of the Agenda for 
Prosperity.  
 
The next level was drafting a set of Sierra Leone specific SDGs indicators (SLSIs) which, before the global indicators were out, were formulated in December 2015 based on the 17 SDGs and 
169 targets, taking into consideration the realities on the ground. A guideline was developed to direct the formulation of these indicators during the first SDGs technical workshop organized in the country in December (see guideline in Box 2). These indicators were revised in June at the second technical workshop, drawing from the 240 indicators released by the UN since March, as well as outcome of the intensified nationwide consultations conducted in June.  
 
We now have advanced draft integrated results framework with Sierra Leone specific SDGs indicators, divided into two tiers. Tier 1 has draft indicators for which there are provisional baselines and targets for 2020, 2025 and 2030. Tier 2 has the full list of initially agreed indicators. So far there are 56 Tier 1 indicators and 139 Tier 2 indicators. This self-explains the priority SDG indicators for Sierra Leone for now, based on the principle of the need to have indicators that are simple, measurable, achievable, realistic and time bound (SMART), and these are the Tier 1. We shall further populate these with Tier 2 indicators as we continue building agreement on them and with availability of data.    
 
For both tiers, further discussions are needed to have a final list of indicators that the country is going to concentrate on.  
 
Priority indicators shall include those exclusively monitored by the g7+ countries that are signatory to the New Deal principles guiding development in fragile states, Sierra Leone being one (see extended discussion on this in the next section).  
 
Therefore, this report continues to signify work in progress in the domestication and planning for the SDGs implementation in Sierra Leone. It is meant to be a broad framework guiding a process that culminates into the production of a National SDGs Investment Plan (NaSIP) for Sierra Leone to be derived from a well costed SDGs needs based assessment.

i. Where targets were identified as similar, the ones that best captured the information   	revealed by all were maintained for the formulation of corresponding indicators  	  
 
Annex 2 presents the two tier draft indicators, which we hope to rationalize further after the July HLPF.  There is an enormous task ahead of finalizing baselines and targets and gathering data for those where none is available.  
 
The Role of the Office of the President  
 
The government has been encountering the enormous challenge of having to do multifarious international benchmark reporting on the status of country governance and development, when this could have been rationalized and saved needed capacity space for public sector management. 
 
 
Government MDAs have had to provide data and reports in response to various donor benchmark frameworks such as the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA), the Afro Barometer, Corruption Perception Index, Mo Ibrahim Index, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the MDGs (now the SDGs), among a range of others in addition to the burden of periodic reporting on benchmarks measuring progress on implementing national development plans such as the Agenda for Prosperity. To reduce the complexity of reporting requirement and rationalize benchmarks with a view to ensuring national ownership of reporting, the government is instituting the Sierra Leone International Benchmark Systems (SLIBS) to be coordinated within the Office of the President in close collaboration with MoFED. The system tries to establish a hub for all benchmarks reporting development status on Sierra Leone to address overlaps, minimize risks of misreporting and advocate for eliminating indicators that are not necessary, while harmonizing others as the case may be. The SDGs are pivotal within the SLIBS and their indicators are a priority. Rationalized SLIBS benchmarks will all be aligned to the Eight Pillars of the Agenda for Prosperity.  
 
Role of Right to Access Information Commission (RAIC)  
The RAIC is an active member of the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data that uses the Open Data Revolution initiate to increase access to reliable data in all forms and formats that will enhance policy decision and development across nations. The Global 
Partnership is supporting efforts at national and subnational levels to develop and implement whole of government and multi-stakeholder SDG Data Revolution roadmaps. These customized roadmaps will serve as guiding frameworks for countries to harness efficient data for sustainable development, with particular emphasis on the SDGs and sustainable development priorities articulated in national plans. As part of this effort, a Toolbox is being developed iteratively based on needs and issues identified through member country national workshops and the partnership network. The first national workshop was held in Bogota, Columbia in May, followed by Sierra Leone in June coordinated by RAIC, drawing participants from across member countries. The Toolbox will draw on existing guidelines and best practices to support SDG monitoring, using real time dynamic, disaggregated data for evidence-based decision making and to enable appropriate country comparison. 
 
The participation of the country in this global initiative is guided by a national Open Data Council coordinated by RAIC drawing membership from all relevant government institutions, non-government organizations, and the university and research institutions; on the government side, it includes the Office of the President, Statistics Sierra Leone, the Ministry of 
Finance and Economic Development, and Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation.  
 
Role of Statistics Sierra Leone Statistics Sierra Leone (SSL) is Government‟s lead institution in carrying out national surveys and certification of national data generated by public institutions and or in collaboration with non-governmental agencies. They have been central in defining the Sierra Leone SDGs indicators put together so far, and in setting baselines and targets. 
 
The 	Ministry 	of 	Foreign 	Affairs 	and International Cooperation 
Sierra Leone‟s participation in the SDGs process has been guided by the diplomatic cover and guidance provided by this Ministry, which shall remain instrumental in the reporting on progress on the new global agenda to the international community. It is facilitating the country‟s participation in the HLPF review.  
 
Local Councils 
The Ministry of Finance and Economic Development and the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development engaged the 19 local councils in Sierra Leone to integrate the SDGs into their district and municipal development plans.  This will ensure that future annual budget proposals of councils are aligned to the SDGs to aid progress reporting on the goals at the local level.   
 
 	 
Non-State Actors  
A non-state actor coalition on SDGs has been formed (see position paper contribution to this report in Annex 3). This coalition is expected to coordinator CSOs and NGOs efforts on SDGs implementation in the country. They will be instrumental 	in 	promoting 	citizen 	and community participation in the implementation and reporting process.  
 
Research input to the process  A number of research papers have been slated to inform the finalization of the SDGs M&E system and preparation of national SDGs investment plan. A few are already underway, including child 	poverty 	measurement 	and 	analysis; multidimensional 	poverty 	approaches 	and projection of poverty status over the next 15 years. Preliminary findings on the level of child poverty using multidimensional approach were presented at the second technical workshop organized to validate and revise the adaptation report in June. A key objective of this paper was to help establish baseline and target for monitoring child poverty in the country. This is work in progress, led by the Central Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation Division of MoFED in collaboration with the United Nations 
Children‟s Fund and Statistics Sierra Leone.       
 
6. Arrangement for Implementation of the SDGs  
6.1 Policy and Reporting Framework The SDGs will be implemented within the existing framework of implementing national development plans such as the current poverty reduction strategy paper or the Agenda for Prosperity, to ensure coherent, harmonized   and aligned national development efforts. The institutional framework is presented in Figure 2. It is proposed to have a Presidential Board on the SDGs (PBS) at the highest policy and political level to provide the overall policy and strategic guidance to the implementation of the SDGs, chaired by the President with members drawn from the Office of the President, the 
Ministry 	of 	Finance 	and 	Economic 
Development, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, the Ministry of Information and Communication, and representation from the Office of the UN Residence Coordinator. Below the PBS is the Ministerial Committee on the SDGs (MCS) to provide operational guidance to the SDGs process across line government ministries, department and agencies, at the central and local level, and across CSOs, NGOs, the private sector, the media, the research community and academia. The MCS will draw membership from MoFED, MFAIC, Statistics Sierra Leone, Open Government Initiative in the Office of the President, and other MDAs, such as the Right to Access Information Commission. Below this are the existing Pillar Working Groups on the Agenda for Prosperity which will be modified to capture technical follow-ups and reporting on the SDGs within the Pillars, drawing actors from the public sector and non-state institutions.      
  
An existing platform for SDGs review at the national level is the Development Partners Committee meetings that have been organized since the immediate post-conflict phase of the country to discuss general development issues of the state, bringing together government institutions and donor agencies, and co-chaired by government and development partners.  
6.2 The New Deal 
Sierra Leone is a signatory to the New Deal for International Engagement in Fragile States, and is committed to promoting use of country systems and Mutual Accountability Frameworks in the implementation of the SDGs, as it has been in the implementation of national plans. The New Deal was endorsed at the Busan High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in 2011 by 
over 40 countries and organizations, including Sierra Leone. It seeks to change the way national and international actors do business in fragile and conflict affected states through established set of basic principles for improved coordination. It focuses on interventions which reinforce country-owned and led priorities for peacebuilding and statebuilding in ways that enable them to more effectively transition out of fragility and conflict. Very recently in April 2016, members of the International Dialogue on Peacebuilding and Statebuilding reiterated their commitment through the Stockholm Declaration on Addressing Fragility and Peacebuilding to implementing the New Deal as a means of ensuring effective delivery of Agenda 2030 and the SDGs in fragile and conflict affected environments.  
Furthermore, the New Deal aims to foster inclusive political dialogue and re-build trust within and between national and international actors operating in fragile contexts, including those characterizing Sierra Leone. The Government of Sierra Leone is currently engaged in devising practical ways of using the New Deal‟s principles in localizing the SDGs in 
 
 
 the country. Their integration into the national plans will (i) be consistent with the principle of political inclusiveness; (ii) give an adequate focus to security and justice; (iii) promote the building of sound economic foundations; and (iv) promote the building of capacity to generate domestic revenue and strengthen service delivery. 
As the current Chair of the g7+ countries, 9 Sierra Leone is particularly keen to give due consideration to the New Deal in the planning and implementation of the SDGs. The Government with work with development partners to ensure that aid towards implementation of the SDGs is transparent, timely and predictable, and channelled through country systems. 
To ensure effective monitoring of the SDGs in fragile contexts, the g7+ countries are developing specific monitoring mechanism under the chairmanship of Sierra Leone involving the establishment of an online portal to enhance follow-up and reporting on agreed set of fragility, peacebuilding and statebuilding related indicators. At the technical meeting held in Nairobi in December 2015, SDGs 6, 7, 8, 9, 16 & 17 were identified as worthy of particular collective monitoring attention. For all 17 Goals, 19 indicators were selected for monitoring, at least one indicator for each goal, with the exception of Goal 13 at the time (these are included and labelled in Annexes 2a&2b). A follow up g7+ technical meeting was held in May 2016 to finalize the indicators. Once agreed, the final indicators will be published on the online portal for monitoring. The benefit of doing this would be to draw common lessons and seek common advocacy positions across the group.  
Government is mindful of the need to increase resilience to economic fragility from external shocks, and the state of the millions of vulnerable children, youth, women and older persons that are caught in the devastating effects of fragile contexts and conflict. Thus, it is committed to institutionalizing early warning signs of conflict, health and environmental shocks within the framework of SDG implementation. It is mindful of the need to promote national cohesion as well as build neutral and professional state institutions consistent with SDG16. 
6.3 Regional and sub-regional dimension The government recognizes the regional and global dimensions to the country‟s sustainable development. This is central in the SDGs, and thus, local adaptation of the Goals shall be effectively linked to regional and global implementation of the Agenda, noting that development actions outside our borders directly or indirectly affect local development. This especially relates to the implementation of SDGs 12, 13, 14, 15, &16, on environmental, governance, peace and security issues.  
7. Conclusion 
7.1 Summary of the Adaptation Process and Key Lessons 
Substantial efforts have been made to integrate the SDGs in Sierra Leone. Extensive debates and discussions were undertaken on different themes to inform the development of a broad framework (the 	Adaptation 	Report) 	to 	guide 	the implementation of the SDGs in the country. Leaving no one behind, balancing the three dimensions of sustainable development, the role of various actors in the process, and how can we make the SDGs better were among the issues debated to inform a direction to ensure that the SDGs yield better results in Sierra Leone. Indicators were developed drawing from the MDGs, 	existing 	national 	development frameworks and realities on the ground, and  updated using global benchmarks and extended engagement on the new agenda across the country, 	involving 	state 	and 	non-state functionaries, local communities, the academia and the private sector. The engagement process was indeed broad and deep, and there is prospect for better results by 2030 if the consultative process and partnerships among all actors are sustained overtime.     
 
The key lessons learned are: (i) timely planning of initiatives has huge prospect of yielding results; (ii) participatory approaches, though potentially costly, remain fundamental to the production of effective plans and results; and (iii) it is impossible to have effective plans in a society without a good data system with capability to produce disaggregated information down to the lowest level and form possible.   
7.2 Next Steps and Challenges The main steps going forward with the planning process for 2016-2018 are: 
a) Follow up with key government institutions, especially the national statistical office, and development partners to further discuss draft indicators and establish baseline data and targets for those without this information. 
b) Continue with the analysis of existing data and preparation of relevant research papers to inform the establishment of baselines and target. 
c) Ensure that MDAs capture the SDGs into their strategic plans submitted to MoFED for 	the 	next 	multi-year 	budget programming of 2017, 2018 and 2019.  
d) Commence SDGs needs based assessment towards the preparation of a national SDGs investment plan to determine the resources required to achieve targets by 2030.   
e) Reactivate the Agenda for Prosperity Pillar Working Groups meeting to embed SDGs planning, follow-up and reporting. 
f) Commence ministerial committee meetings on the SDGs. 
g) Commence discussions on the successor poverty reduction strategy informed by the SDGs and other developments. 
a) Sustain regular dialogue with actors 
involved in the implementation of the goals, including CSOs, local government and others. 
b) Also integrate African Union Agenda 2063 into national plans. 
Challenges include: 
a) Having many actors to coordinate 
b) Reliance on unpredictable donor support 
to carry out development programmes 
c) Sharp decline of state revenues  
d) Recovering from the extended effects of Ebola epidemic and ensuring diversified and inclusive economy 
e) Addressing data bottlenecks  
f) The country generally remaining a fragile state including exposure to climate change effects and facing large number of youths to provide effective and decent work for  
g) Inadequate incentives for public sector personnel  
Overcoming these problems requires: 
c) Sustained government commitment and enhanced partnership with development partners 
d) Increased capacity to develop bankable development projects  
e) Increase coordination within and between government agencies and non-state actors to reduce duplication of functions and minimize any wastage of resources  
f) Step up implementation of reform 
programmes to increase capacity of the public sector and incentives 
g) Fully identify the drivers of fragility in the country and work out concrete action 
plan to address them in the context of the 
SDGs
