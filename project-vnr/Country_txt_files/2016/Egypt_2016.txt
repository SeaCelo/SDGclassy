Chapter 1 
National Context and Long Term Vision  
 
1.1 Sustainable Development in the National Context    
Egypt has adopted an approach towards achieving sustainable development that is characterized by a high level of ambition, firm commitment and dynamic innovation. It has proven to be a strong and resilient nation in the face of various challenges: economic, social, and political; and at all levels: global, regional and national. Over the past seven years, inspired by its ancient civilization, Egypt has been able to overcomes the challenges posed by the global economic and financial crisis in 2008, social and political turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa that began in 2010, and two national popular uprisings, in 2011 and 2014. Despite challenges, Egypt was able to accommodate and set a solid foundation for sustainable development through visionary and determined political leadership, strong public support, as well as regional and international cooperation.  
At the national level, inclusive and sustainable development is a core constitutional value and an overall strategic objective. Before the launch of the SDGs in September 2015, Egypt committed itself towards achieving sustainable development through the Egyptian Constitution, which was drafted and adopted in January 20141. This revised Egyptian Constitution is highly aligned with the philosophy, principles and goals of sustainable development and of 2030 global agenda, and was approved through a national referendum. It covers the three dimensions of sustainable development, as well as many of the 17 SDGs in its different articles, presented as national goals, binding all sectors and levels of government, and calling upon different stakeholders to participate in a state-lead developmental process towards achieving them. The new Constitution marks significant improvement compared to the previous one in securing citizens’ rights to education, health, protection, and development. It contains articles on strengthening governance, equality, and social justices. It is a modern Constitution that ensures the constitutional rights of citizens, while guaranteeing that no one is left behind. 
To meet the demands of the Egyptian people, in May 2014, Egypt held presidential elections and appointed a new cabinet, with a clear and coordinated vision towards achieving inclusive economic growth and sustainable development. By the end of 2015. with the political roadmap in place, and based on the embodiment of the new constitutional spirit, Egypt began developing its vision for a better future through the establishment of the Sustainable Development Strategy (SDS): Egypt Vision 2030"2 in 2014, launched in early 2016. The launch of the strategy signals the start of its implementation process, which is aligned with the SDGs in terms of both content and implementation period. To move forwards with implementation, the strategy was reflected in the Government program for the period 2016- 2018, which represented the executive program of the SDS in the medium term. In addition, the Government developed the sustainable development plan for the FY 2016/2017, which represents the execution plan for the first year of SDS implementation. The strategy and the midterm program were presented and ratified by the parliament with absolute majority in April 2016, and the annual plan was approved in June 2016.  
 
                                                           
At the regional level, Egypt, with the firm belief that regional stability and prosperity is requisite for national security and achieving sustainable development, is undertaking huge efforts, in cooperation with its regional partners, to tackle the challenges of water security, energy security, terrorism, forced displacement and illegal immigration. For over 20 years, the Cairo Center for Conflict Resolution and Peacekeeping in Africa2 (CCCPA), has been at the forefront of Egyptian efforts to promote peace and development in Africa and the Arab world, through its work on training and capacity building. In addition, Egypt led the African continent in climate change negotiations at Conference of Parties (COP21) in Paris and launched through H.E President El Sisi in his capacity as coordinator of the Committee of Heads of States for Climate Change (CAHOSCC) two wide African initiatives The African Renewable Energy Initiative and African Adaptation Initiative . More recently, Egypt chaired the Tenth Committee on Sustainable Development in Africa to integrate implementations of both Agenda 2063 and the SDGs. Within the framework of Egypt's chairing the African Ministerial Conference on Environment (2015-2017), Egypt hosted the sixth special session of the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment in April 2016 where the decision (DSS 1/SS6) was adopted by African Ministers on Implementation of 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Sustainable Development Goals and African Union’s Agenda 2063.  
At the global level, despite the challenges Egypt faces, Egypt has been a keen participant in international efforts towards enhancing sustainable development.  Egypt was actively engaged in the preparation for and the negotiations in various global fora around the Agenda 2030 and the SDGs, and will remain committed to the effective implementation of these historical agreements through mutually beneficial cooperation, in order to end all forms of poverty, fight inequalities, and tackle climate change, while ensuring that no one is left behind. Over 17,000 Egyptians voted on the “World We Want 2030: My World” platform where they voted for the priorities of the world and built a collective vision that was used by World Leaders to plan the 2030 Agenda.3  
Several efforts have also been exerted to strengthen Egypt’s ties with its existing international partners, as well as explore new opportunities for cooperation, in order to enhance Egypt’s role in the international arena, and boost investment and trade opportunities, all through the establishment of mutually-beneficial partnerships. This in part has involved consolidating Egyptian-Gulf relationships, expanding and deepening ties with African states, and exploring new relationships with Asian partners.  
Egypt has also been committed to supporting sustainable development in the least developed countries, through capacity building and technical support partnerships via the Egyptian Agency of Partnership for Development (EAPD). Egypt was keen to address the challenges of climate change through participating in the COP21 climate change conference in Paris, and submitting its report on the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) towards achieving the objectives of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).  
With the aim of contributing to the process of global knowledge sharing on the SDGs, Egypt has volunteered to be among the pioneering 22 countries that will present their national reviews to the HLPF in July 2016. Finally, Egypt is currently seeking to host the international conference on biodiversity in 2018 to further enhance supporting the Multilateral Environmental agreement with special emphasis on the sustainable management of natural resources which is a cornerstone of the principles of sustainable development   
                                                           
 
1.2 Key National, Regional and Global Challenges 
The path towards achieving the SDGs is not an easy one; it encompasses a range of local, regional and global challenges that require the effective pooling and coordinating of efforts on all levels to be overcome. There are three main factors that play a major role in achieving the SDGs; (i) political will, which, in Egypt, is strong and presents firm commitment; (ii) integration and mainstreaming of the SDGs in the planning and policy making process, which is manifested by the SDS: Egypt Vision 2030, and (iii) resource mobilization in terms of financing, human capital, and institutional capacity, where further support is required. Furthermore  Egypt, similar to all countries, faces various challenges in achieving sustainable development in all three dimensions, social, economic, and environmental; and at different levels, national, regional, and international.  
At the national level, the population growth rate is among the key challenges. According to the Central Authority for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS)4, Egypt’s population reached 91 million in June 2016 with a growth rate of 2.4 percent, five times the rate in developed countries and double the rate in many other developing countries. As an example, this rate is eight times the growth rate in the Republic of Korea, and five times the rate in China.  
Despite the efforts of the Government to promote economic development, continued population growth has a significant effect on the prospect of making progress in reducing inflation, poverty, and unemployment rates and raising standards of living. Rapid population growth may also lead to increased levels of malnutrition and food and energy insecurity, and of increased urban migration within Egypt. In addition, this population growth rate poses a burden on job creation efforts, leading to high unemployment rates, especially among youth and women. In 2014, unemployment rates among young people reached 27.3 percent. The scale of the informal sector in Egypt’s economy is high, reaching 40 percent of GDP in 2013, and there is evidence that this figure is growing5, creating other challenges. It is worth noting however, that there have been improvements in the unemployment rate, which has witnessed a slight decrease in recent years.  
Water scarcity also represents a challenge in the light of population growth and production and consumption needs. Egypt suffers from a water deficit of up to 20 billion cubic meters of water annually7. These challenges are compounded by the adverse effect of climate change, therefore creating a need for significant mitigation and adaptation efforts, especially with Egypt being among the most vulnerable countries in the region in that regard.  
At the regional level, instability in the region, has had a negative spillover effect on the Egyptian economy, particularly the tourism sector. There have been a variety of negative economic impacts, such as loss of revenues and a decline in the value of the local currency, as well as negative impacts on the social conditions of the country, such as an increase in the unemployment rate and in poverty levels. The large influx of refugees associated with the political instability in the region and the events following the Arab spring has further strained the public budget and has implications for creating job opportunities and providing quality services. Egypt has nonetheless welcomed these refugees and is committed to providing them with the same living standards as Egyptian citizens.6   
On the international level, the global economic slowdown posed an economic challenge that affects the capacity for resource mobilization, which in turn caused a high budget deficit and a fiscal crunch that hindered the mobility of needed resources to fully implement the development objectives, programs and projects. In this regard, there is also a pressing need for enhancing an equitable, fair and transparent multilateral trading system to overcome trade barriers that hinder sustainable and inclusive economic growth, as well as an urgent need for the rational use of property rights that does not hinder sustainable development in developing countries. Furthermore, there is a strong need for more coordinated strategic action towards achieving the SDGs. Despite the commendable progress made, Egypt, similar to most middleincome countries, is at an early stage of the learning curve towards effective strategic and coordinated action for achieving the SDGs. The journey is still long in terms of implementing the right mix of policy initiatives, particularly environmental-fiscal reform initiatives, which are typically underleveraged. There is also still work to be done with regards to embedding the SDGs within the national budgeting process, in which the Ministry of Finance will need to play a major role in terms of policy formulation and implementation. It is also important to note that coordination at the sub-national and local levels is inherently complex, and requires the establishment of effective and streamlined coordination mechanisms. For feedback mechanisms, including monitoring; learning and adaption; integrated sets of indicators will need to be developed and harmonized with national policies. Integrated sets of indicators coupled with informal approaches will allow analysis of the inherent trade-offs and interlinkages among the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development. 
 
1.3 Integrating the Three Dimensions of Sustainable Development 
Learning from the past and inspired by the present, Egypt is paving the way ahead through developing the national Sustainable Development Strategy: Egypt’s Vision 2030, based on the embodiment of the new constitutional spirit, setting welfare and prosperity as the main objectives, achieved through sustainable development, social justice, and balanced geographical and social growth. This strategy aims to meet the need to develop a unified, long-term political, economic, social and environmentally aware sustainability vision, and to be a base for short- and medium-term development plans at the national, local, and sectoral levels, to meet the ambitions of Egyptian citizens.  The strategy aims to engage all stakeholders, including private sector and civil society, in achieving its vision and objectives.  It also aims to enable the parliament to monitor the implementation of the strategy’s objectives, targets, programs and projects within a specific timeframe and against a clear set of SMART key performance indicators (KPIs). At the regional and global levels, the strategy aims to align its objectives with those of the 2030 agenda and the African Union’s Sustainable Development Strategy for 2063. 
According to the Sustainable Development Strategy: Egypt Vision 2030, “By 2030, the new Egypt will achieve a competitive, balanced, diversified and knowledge-based economy, characterized by justice, social integration and participation, with a balanced and diversified ecosystem, benefiting from its strategic location and human capital to achieve sustainable development for a better life for all Egyptians.” 
The strategy also states that by 2030 Egypt will be among the top thirty countries in terms of:  (i) the size of the economy; (ii) Market competitiveness; (iii)  Human development; (iv) Quality of life; and (v) Anti-corruption.

1.4 Report Methodology and Objectives 
This report followed a collaborative and harmonized approach among a wide range of governmental experts, led by official focal points of the National Committee for the Follow Up on the Implementation of the SDGs, of which the Ministry of International Cooperation is the National Coordinator, and also involved all other relevant national entities In addition, many other stakeholders, including NGOs, representatives of the private sector, and members of parliament were consulted during the drafting of the report. Technical support toward the preparation of the review report was provided by the United Nations Development 
Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Department of Economic and Social 
Affairs (DESA).   
The first stream of information was obtained from credible formal data resources, including national strategies and reports, while the second was obtained through consultations, workshops, structured and semi-structured interviews with Government officials, and other stakeholders, including where possible representatives of the private sector members and of NGOs, in order to fill in gaps and improve the accuracy of the report. Another stream of information was gathered through attendance at conferences and workshops covering the 2030 Agenda. Every effort was made to ensure regular feedback from stakeholders on interim versions of the report.  
The following factors were taken into account in preparing this report;  
1. Voluntary common reporting guidelines for voluntary national reviews by the HLPF. 
2. International reporting standards  
3. International and national initiatives  
4. The National and legislative framework 
This process report aims at providing an extensive review of ongoing and planned efforts to mainstream, implement, follow-up, and review the SDGs within and in accordance with a national set of priorities. The report also provides an overview of key challenges, examples of good practices, and areas where further support is needed. 
 
 	 
Chapter 2: Policy and Enabling Environment  
2.1 Introduction  
In 2016, the Government launched its SDS: Egypt's Vision 2030, which is guided by the 2030 Agenda, and developed with extensive consultation with stakeholders—Government, the private sector, and civil society. This chapter outlines the Sustainable Development Strategy: Egypt’s Vision 2030, and will put into perspective the national strategy and its contribution to achieve the SDGs. It will highlight the role of different stakeholders in planning the sustainable development strategy. It will provide preliminary evidence on the level of alignment between the strategy and the SDGs at the level of goals and targets. Finally, the chapter will provide an in-depth analysis of three selected SDGs, and finally a thematic analysis on women, children, young people, and refugees, in light of the theme of the upcoming High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, “Ensuring that No One is Left Behind". 
 
2.2 National Framework for Implementing the 2030 SDGs  
As previously mentioned, in Egypt inclusive and sustainable development is considered a core constitutional value and an overall strategic objective. Before the launch of the SDGs in September 2015, Egypt committed itself to achieving sustainable development in the Egyptian constitution. The constitution covers the three dimensions of sustainable development, and addresses many of the 17 SDGs in its different articles as national goals, and calling upon different stakeholders to participate in a state-led, nationally owned, developmental process towards achieving them. The new constitution marks a significant improvement over the previous one, in terms of securing citizens’ rights to education, health, protection, and development. It contains articles on strengthening governance, equality, and social justice. It is a modern constitution that ensures the constitutional rights of citizens, while guaranteeing that no one is left behind. 
In accordance with the new constitution, adopted in January 2014, the Government immediately embarked on planning and implementing major national projects that serve the objectives of inclusive and sustainable development. These projects were later mainstreamed into the newly adopted national strategy for sustainable development, SDS: Egypt’s Vision 2030. The strategy was drafted through an inclusive and integrative process that ensured the involvement of various governmental bodies, different societal sectors, academia and civil society organizations. It was endorsed by the newly elected parliament in April 2016.  
SDS: Egypt’s Vision 2030 serves as the national umbrella through which the SDGs will be implemented in Egypt. The strategy reflects the priorities of Egyptians for a better future for them and for next generations, maximizes the benefits of diversified resources and explores untapped opportunities. SDS adopts the principles of sustainability and is  guided by the universal SDGs. The strategy will be implemented by all stakeholders, including the Government, the private sector, civil society organizations, and international development organizations, in a cohesive approach. 
 
2.3 Scope and Framework of the Strategy 
The core principle of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the SDGs is 
“universality” and “inclusivity". All goals require action by all countries, must address the needs of all people, ensuring that no one is left behind. In addition, the SDGs aim to deepen the links between the three pillars of sustainable development, the social, economic and environmental, and between actions taken within different sectors. They therefore form the basis of a more comprehensive and integrated development agenda. With this core philosophy in mind, the SDGs were formulated around a number of principles.  
The core philosophy of SDS: Egypt’s Vision 2030 is in line with the core principles of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, and is is based on the principles of inclusive and ambitious sustainable development and balanced regional development, emphasizing the patricipation of all stakeholders, and ensuring the benefit of all. The main framework of the strategy stems from the Egyptian consititution’s emphasis on welfare and prosperity as the core for economic objectives to be achieved by sustainable development, social justice, and geographical and growth. The strategy aims at providing equal opportuinity for all, and closing development gaps through efficient use of resources to ensure the rights of future generations. As highlighted in the strategy, it is both state-led and nationally-owned.   
Throughout its planning phase, between the Year 2014 and 2016, the strategy followed a highly participatory approach. The planning process included experts, academics, public and private sector representatives, governmental officials and international institutions, as well as representatives from a wide range of societal groups, including women, young people and the disabled, and international partners from the United Nations system8, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The World Bank provided technical assistance and expertise. The strategy was periodically communicated to the public through community dialogues and many different local, regional and international forums and seminars, and is still being communicated and regularly updated. The formulation of the strategy involved four phases (see below): 
Phase I: The Preparation Phase. Beginning early in 2014, a sitiuation analysis was conducted to assess current and future national and international challenges. In addition, a review was conducted of all previous national and sectoral strategies and visions prepared by civil society and the private sector, in addition to international strategies. 
 
Phase II: The Preparation of the Main Thrust Phase. Through the second half of 2014, the major structure and framework of the strategy was formulated, the pillars were decided, and the visions, goals and targets were formulated through a comprehensive consultative process that was carried out through a sequence of workshops for each pillar that included Government officials, experts, academics, youth, civil society and the private sector, to ensure the widest possible participation level.  
 
Phase III: Policy and Projects Prioritization Phase. During the first half of 2015, targets for different pillars were transformed into planned projects and programs. In addition, key performance indicators were developed and quantified time-bound objectives were set by all relevant stakholders. A very rough estimate of the cost of different programs, projects and initiatives was also determined. 
 
Phase IV: Preparation of Strategy for National Dialogue. During the second half of 2015, the strategy was revised by all relevant parties, a national plan for public dialogue was created, and the strategy was presented in a national conference under the sponsorship of the president and endorsed by the newly elected parliament in April 2016.   
 
 
To ensure full national ownership and transparency, the strategy is open to public dialogue and debate in diffent national and international fora, and is considered a living, dynamic document. Short films about the strategy have been created, a simplified version of the document has been disseminated through a dedidicated website and social media coverage.  Furthermore, during the planning phase a national and reputable private consulting company was assigned to consult with between different stakeholders. This move established trust and encouraged different stakeholders to actively and deeply participate in negotiations and debate, and delivered the message that this strategy is developed by Egyptians for all Egyptians and is not related to a specific Government institution. and will indeed leave no one behind.  
 
The resulting strategy, which was launched during the “Youth Year” festivities, on February 24, 2016, is comprehensive and multidimensional, and ensures the needs of current and future generations. It contains 45 strategic goals that cover each of the three dimensions of sustainable development, economic, social and environmental. Each dimension is subdivided into pillars followed by its key performance indicators for measurement of progress. The economic dimension has 77 key performance indicators covering all of its four pillars, the social dimension has 61 key performance indicators covering its four pillars, and the environmental dimension has 31 key performance indicators covering its two pillars.  The interlinkages and integrated nature of the strategic goals are of crucial importance in ensuring that the purpose of the strategy is realized. If the ambitions across the full extent of the strategy are realized, the lives of all will be profoundly improved and Egypt will be transformed for the better11.

12 Sustainable Development Strategy: Egypt’s Vision 2030. Workshop on National Development Strategies and Plans for the Middle East & Central Asia Region October 27th 2015, Nihal El Megharbel, PhD First Assistant to the Minister of Planning, Monitoring and Administrative Reform 
 
 
The Government Program was presented on March 27, 2016, and was ratified on April 20, 2016.  This Government program includes seven dimensions, including national security, consolidating democratic structure, inclusive economic growth, social justice, infrastructure, administrative reform, and foreign relations. In addition, the Ministry of Planning, Monitoring and Administrative Reform (MoPMAR) prepared the “Sustainable Development Plan for the FY 2016/2017 representing the implementation plan for the first year of both the medium term Government program and the long-term strategy. Both MoPMAR and the Ministry of Finance (MoF) presented the FY plan and budget for the Parliament that was ratified in June 2016, and the implementation started in July 2016 representing the real kickoff to advance Egypt’s sustainable development strategy.   
The sustainable development plan and budget for FY 2016/2017, are primarily focused on achieving inclusive economic growth, enhancing social justice, and increasing employment rates, particularly among young people. The growth will be inclusive, ensuring sustainability and preserving the rights of future generations, and will primarily benefit the poor and enhance the services provided to them, including housing, water, sanitation, health and education, and ensure that subsidies are well-targeted and reach those most in need. The plan and budget encourage the positive contribution of both the private sector and the civil society organizations (CSOs) in achieving the targets and in implementing the different programs and projects. The priorities of the plan and budget include achieving the constitutional requirements of raising the share of the budget allocated to human resources development, namely to education, health and scientific research. Social and economic services are spatially distributed equitably. The plan and the budget identify quantifiable social, economic and environmental objectives and link them to the Medium-term Sustainable Development Program 2016-2018 and SDS: Egypt Vision 2030.  
 
2.4 Alignment between the Egyptian Constitution and the Sustainable Development Strategy, and the SDGs 
Efforts are also being exerted to identify the level of alignment between the Constitution, the SDS: Egypt Vision 2030, and the 2030 SDGs on the level of goals, targets and key performance indicators. In this respect a task force was established within the Ministry of Planning to identify the level of alignment at the goal and target level, and areas where further alignment is required. In addition, a Sustainable Development Unit was established at the CAPMAS, the national Statistical Agency, to map national indicators, identify the level of alignment on the key performance indicator level and areas that will need more alignment. CAPMAS has been collaborating with the UN system taking part in the 2016 Africa Data Report Initiative to assess what is needed to fully realize the data revolution. The Report will feed into other SDG initiatives and studies by providing a concrete analysis of data issues at the national and regional level 13 and to appraise the data ecosystem in Egypt and identify areas where capacity could be leveraged to meet the needs of data collection for the SDGs.14 Alignment at the goal level is briefly summarized below: 
1. The Egyptian Constitution: The initial screening of all SDGs at the goals level, with the exception of SDG 17 which deals with the means of implementation, shows that they are highly relevant to the Egyptian context and in fact most of the goals are 
                                                           
13
  The 2016 Africa Data Report is a joint initiative between Economic Commission for Africa, UNDP, International Development Research Centre and World Wide Web Foundation. The initiative aims to capture the current state of data ecosystems on the continent, in order to establish in 2016 as the first year of the SDG era a baseline against which progress of the data revolution for sustainable development can be measured in subsequent years. 
 
covered by the Egyptian Constitution, either by one article or more. In fact the constitution was found to cover not only goals but also many SDG targets and key performance indicators, providing quantified objectives. For example, Article 180 on the election of local councils mandates: “One quarter of the seats are allocated to youth under 35 years old, one quarter is allocated for women, workers and farmers are represented by no less than 50 percent of the total number of seats, and these percentages include a proper representation of Christians and people with disabilities.” This is strongly in line with SDG 5 and 16. Another example is Article 19 on education, which commits the state to allocating no less than 4 percent of GDP to education, to gradually increase until it reaches global rates. This is strongly in line with SDG 4.  
2. Egypt’s sustainable development strategy: The initial screening of the SDGs goals showed that most are covered in Egypt’s sustainable development strategy. SDG 3 ensures healthy lives and promotes well-being for all at all ages; SDG 4 ensures inclusive and equitable quality education and promotes life-long learning opportunities for all; SDG 5 achieves gender equality and empowers women and girls; SDG 7 ensures access to affordable reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all; SDG 8 promotes sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all; SDG 10 reduces inequalities within and among countries; SDG 11 make cities and human settlement inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable; SDG 16 promotes peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provides access to justice for all and builds effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.  
Eight goals, out of seventeen total are consistent with corresponding pillars in Egypt’s sustainable development strategy: health, energy, social justice, education and training, urban development, economic development, the environmental pillar, transparency and efficient Government institutions. Three SDGs are holistic in nature and hence are covered under more than one pillar of the strategy: SDG 1, to end poverty in all its forms everywhere, is covered under the strategy’s economic development pillar, social justice pillar and environmental pillar. SDG 6, to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, is covered under the urban development and environmental pillars. SDG 9, to build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation, is included under the urban development and innovation pillars. Three out of sixteen SDGs, namely SDG 13, to take urgent actions to combat climate change and its impacts, SDG 14, to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development, and SDG 15, to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss, are included and addressed under one pillar of Egypt’s strategy, the environmental pillar.  
Two out of the sixteen goals are addressed indirectly by all pillars of the strategy, namely SDG 2, to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture, and SDG 12, to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns. With regards to SDG17, which focuses on means of implementation with respect to finance, technology, trade, capacity building and systematic issues, it is covered by the SDS: Egypt Vision 2030 under different pillars. For instance, the economic development pillar discusses the issue of raising more revenue through taxes, as well as efficient allocation means. Technological barriers are also addressed under several pillars, and relevant KPIs & programs are outlined to address these barriers. 
 
 
 
2.5 	Effective Coordination and Shared Responsibility  
Institutional Mechanisms 
Several efforts are underway to establish adequate institutional mechanisms to ensure effective coordination among stakeholders, track progress, and advance implementation of the SDGs.  
In December 2015, a national committee to follow up on the implementation of the SDGs, to which the Ministry of International Cooperation is the rapporteur, was established by Prime Ministerial Decree and mandated with the mission to coordinate efforts toward the SDGs. The committee, which is under the direct supervision of the Prime Minister, is comprised of the Ministries of: International Cooperation; Planning, Follow-Up and Administrative Reform; Environment; Social Solidarity; Local Development; Higher Education and Research; Health; Housing, Utilities, and Urban Communities; and Education and Technical education. The National Council for Women, the National Council for Motherhood and Childhood, and the Central Authority for Public Mobilization and Statistics are also members of the committee.  
A Sustainable Development Unit has already been established at the Ministry of Environment to foster the achievement of the sustainable development strategy and the SDGs, with emphasis on the environmental dimension, similar Units are currently being established within other line ministries. Until these units are established, planning units in different ministries and governmental bodies are mandated with the responsibility to integrate the three dimensions of sustainable development in the planning process, particularly in investment plans9. A new sustainable development planning report was designed and disseminated to all ministries and governmental bodies.  
The responsibility of planning, coordinating, following up on implementation of the sustainable development strategy falls on the Ministry of Planning, Monitoring and Administrative Reform, while the responsibility for implementation is a collaborative effort between different ministries and governmental units.   
   
Follow Up and Review 
Despite the early stage, effort has been made with regards to follow up and review on the achievements of the sustainable development strategy and the SDGs. The Ministry of Planning is in the process of designing a structure for reviewing and following up on the SDGs goals, targets and indicators for Egypt, to ensure transparency and accountability to citizens. The monitoring structure proposed is comprehensive and includes the civil society and the private sector. The new mechanism includes the establishment of an independent unit for monitoring and follow-up and reporting to the Presidency, Cabinet, and Parliament, and mandated with monitoring and reviewing the sustainable development strategy, reviewing the key performance indicators, and evaluating the effect of programs and projects on the sustainable development strategy. The unit also has the mandate to provide a sustainable mechanism to follow up on implementation of projects and programs included in the strategy and in evaluating the degree of alignment of national and sectoral executive plans with the strategy’s objectives. In addition, the council will play a major role in solving problems and obstacles that may arise during the implementation phase.  
The efforts of the inter-ministerial National Committee for following up on the implementation of the SDGs, of which the Ministry of International Cooperation is the rapporteur, is also playing a central role in that regard, by ensuring effective coordination and tracking progress  
                                                           
With regards to the collection of national data, CAPMAS, the national Statistical Agency is taking a lead in mapping national indicators and integrating the SDG proposed monitoring framework.  CAPMAS has participated in the 47th session of the UN Statistical Commission and to the Interagency Expert Group (IEAG) meeting on the review of the SDGs indicators framework In April 2016, a Sustainable development unit within CAPMAS was established to review national indicators, identify gaps and facilitate the collect of data to monitor the SDGs and SDS: Egypt’s Vision 2030. The findings of this activity has presented a clear picture of the current situation in Egypt regarding data and indicators and is presented in the graph below. Indicators have been grouped as follows; 
- Available indicators with its data available. 
- Indicators that do not have any clear current measurements yet.  
- Irrelevant indicators to Egypt’s current situation. 
- Qualitative indicators, that may or may not be available.  
- Indicators that are still under investigation through collaboration other institutions - Not specified data, still under study. - Not available  

.  
 
CAPMAS has also identified the expected challenges for data collection, and is exploring ways to overcome these challenges. The main challenges are primarily concerned with the data gap and availability of updated data, as well as the need for capacity building of institutions and individuals involved in the data collection process.  
 
Partnerships for the Goals 
While the implementation of the SDGs in Egypt is a nationally-owned and country-led process, the goals will only be realized with a strong commitment to global partnership and international cooperation, as highlighted through Goal 17, “Partnerships for the Goals”. In that regard, the Ministry of International Cooperation, with strong collaboration with Egypt’s development partners, has been playing an active role in strengthening bilateral and multilateral partnerships, securing financial and non-financial assistance to complement national efforts to achieve the SDGs.  
The Ministry of International Cooperation is strongly committed to ensuring that all projects implemented through ODA are aligned with the SDGs, and a preliminary mapping exercise of all ODA-funded projects in Egypt, shows almost complete alignment between project objectives and one or more of the SDGs. Moving forwards, the Ministry of International Cooperation will require all project proposals to clearly outline alignment and contributions towards achieving the SDGs. Box 1, Box 2, and Box 4 showcases examples of projects supported by development partners, through the Ministry of International Cooperation, implemented by line ministries, which are directly advancing the achievements of the SDGs in Egypt.  
 Box 1
Key ODA-Funded Projects Advancing the SDG 6—Quality Water and  Sanitation Services 
The Government of Egypt is committed to providing access to clean water and sanitation for all Egyptians. The Ministry of International Cooperation is exerting several efforts in that regard, through leveraging support from development partners, to provide the needed infrastructure, and expand access to clean water and sanitation, especially in lagging regions. A prime example is the World Bank Sustainable Rural Sanitation Services Program, with the objective of providing new sanitation connections (mostly but not exclusively to sewerage systems), which involve improved wastewater collection, treatment and management. This projects directly targets Goal 6, “Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all”, as well as contributes to Goal 3 “Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages”, Goal 1, “End poverty in all its forms everywhere”, and Goal 10, “Reduce inequality within and among countries”. A further example is the project implemented with the support of the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development (AFESD), which expands access to clean water to 500 previously unserved villages.Moreover, to complement efforts to develop the Sinai Peninsula, the Saudi Fund for Development is supporting the establishment of desalination and water treatment plants in Sinai, to improve the standards of living and quality of life of citizens living in these areas.  
 
 
 	 
Chapter 3: In Depth and Thematic Analysis 
 
3.1 Introduction 
While this review aims to present the situation and the progress across all of the SDGs in the national context in a clustered and harmonized manner, the following section highlights three specific goals and provides in-depth analysis of the implementation progress and the challenges involved in achieving them. It is worthy to note that due to the cross-cutting nature of the SDGs, efforts exerted towards one goal, often have spillover effects on other goals.  
 
SDG 1: End Poverty in All Its Forms Everywhere  
 
Current Situation   
A major priority for the Government of Egypt and the Parliament is the eradication of poverty. Egypt has experienced a gradual decrease of poverty based on the international definition of poverty set at $1.25 PPP per day, which has decreased from 4.46 percent in 1990 to 1.68 percent in 2008 (SDG Target 1.1.).  
 
This decrease is also in line with trends in Egypt’s multidimensional poverty index (MPI), which is published by UNDP and Oxford University. The MPI is a recommended indicator for SDG Target 1.2 that promotes to ‘reduce at least half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions’ by 2030. Accordingly to the MPI, Egypt has seen a gradual decrease of multidimensional poverty from 8.2 percent (headcount ratio) in 2005 to 3.6 percent in 2014. These positive changes indicate Egypt’s progress made in tackling extreme poverty and deprivation of its vulnerable populations.  
 

Source: World Development Indicators (2016) 
 
However, despite these positive trends in extreme poverty, the national poverty rate has seen a rise from 16.7 percent in 1999/2000 to 26.3 percent in 2012/2013. This figure indicates that around 22.5 million Egyptians are unable to meet their basic food and non-food needs. While the international poverty indicators have pointed to improvements, the national poverty line shows an opposite trend line sharp increases in the poverty rate. There could be various reasons behind this discrepancy, but it highlights the importance of having contextualized information and high frequency data disaggregated for various groups to understand the various dimensions and complexities of poverty.  
 

Source: World Development Indicators (2016) 
 
Furthermore, there is a significant difference in the poverty rate based on regions and geographies where over half of the population in Upper rural Egypt live under the poverty line. In addition to Upper Egypt, a significant number of poor also reside in the urban areas, mostly in informal settlements in the outskirts of Cairo and Giza.  
Hence, while building on the progress that has been made in tackling extreme poverty and deprivation, there is an urgency to address the regional disparities in poverty as well as look at emerging challenges of urban poor linked with Egypt’s demographic changes.  
Social protection was a major sector for Egypt’s Government expenditure constituting some 25-30 percent of the total amount. However, the majority of Government funds on social protected have been dedicated to spending on fuel and food subsidies, which consisted up to 90 percent of the total expenditure on social protection. While there are some benefits, subsidies especially fuel subsidies are considered to be ‘one of the costliest and least effective interventions, which large amount of public budget dedicated to offsetting global price fluctuations and most of the benefits going to higher earners who consume more fuel.’16

Recognizing the need to increase the efficiency of its subsidy regime, the Government of Egypt has been embarking on a new approach to social protection building on international experience. It has started the reform of its fuel and food subsidies and has introduced two new cash transfer programmes, called Takaful and Karama, which targets the poor and vulnerable population directly. Combined with further efforts of subsidy reform, these new programmes indicator positive policy changes the Government’s commitment to achieving ‘nationally appropriate social protection’ and ensuring ‘the rights to social security’ as prescribed by the SDGs and Egypt’s constitution.  
 
The Egyptian Constitution and Poverty Eradication   
 Article 27: Economic System: The economic system aims at achieving prosperity in the country through sustainable development and social justice to guarantee an increase in the real growth rate of the national economy, raising the standard of living, increasing job opportunities, reducing unemployment rates and eliminating poverty. 
Article 8: Social Solidarity: Society is based on social solidarity. The state commits to achieving social justice, providing the means to achieve social solidarity to ensure a decent life for all citizens, in the manner organized by law. 
Article 11: The Place of Women, Motherhood and Childhood: The state commits to achieving equality between women and men in all civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights in accordance with the provisions of this Constitution. The state commits to taking the necessary measures to ensure appropriate representation of women in the houses of parliament, in the manner specified by law. It grants women the right to hold public posts and high management posts in the state, and to appointment in judicial bodies and entities without discrimination. The state commits to the protection of women against all forms of violence, and ensures women empowerment to reconcile the duties of a woman toward her family and her work requirements. The state ensures care and protection and care for motherhood and childhood, and for breadwinning, and elderly women, and women most in need. 
Article 17: Social Security Services: The state provides social security services. All citizens who have no access to the social security system have the right to social security to ensure a decent life, if they are unable to support themselves and their families in the event of incapacity to work, old age or unemployment. The state works to provide appropriate pensions to small farmers, agricultural workers, hunters and informal labor in accordance with the law. Insurance and pension funds are private and enjoy all forms of protection afforded to public funds. Together with their returns, they are a right of their beneficiaries. They shall be invested in a safe manner and managed by an independent entity, in accordance with the law. The state guarantees funds for insurance and pensions.

Flagship Projects and Initiatives to Combat Poverty: 
In light of Egypt’s ambitious SDS: Egypt Vision 2030, and in the alignment with the transformative SDGs, the Government of Egypt realized the importance of adopting a comprehensive strategy to reduce poverty, and to pave the way for social justice. As such, a plan of action has been set in motion, which focuses on reducing poverty by adopting some programs to protect the poor, support the marginalized societal factions and provide protection to the most vulnerable.  
 Box 2
 Key ODA-Funded Projects Advancing the SDGs—MSE Development
To complement and scale-up efforts to develop micro and small enterprises (MSEs) in Egypt, the Ministry of International Cooperation leveraged support from several development partners including the Saudi Fund for Development; World Bank; African Development Bank; Agence Francaise de Development (AfD); KfW; GIZ, and the OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID) who are providing lines of credit as well as technical assistance, with the overarching aim of job creation, skills development, promoting entrepreneurship, and poverty reduction. These projects specifically target underserved segments such as youth and women, as well as lagging regions where the incidence of poverty is higher. These programs are clearly linked to the SDGs: Goal 1, which aims to eradicate poverty, includes a specific target that “all men and women, in particular the poor and the vulnerable, have equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to basic services”. This highlights the importance of providing all segments of society with equal opportunity to pursue their livelihoods, to bring them—and keep them—out of poverty. Efforts to achieve Goal 2, which focuses on food security and agricultural productivity, are also be supported through MSE promotion. For example, microloans provided under these programs provide farmers with capital to invest in inputs such as seeds and fertilizers, which enables them to enhance their productivity, increase their earnings, and hence improve their standards of living. Goal 5 of the SDGs aims to achieve greater gender equality and to promote women’s empowerment.  Microfinance is an important accelerator of gender-inclusive development. Goal 8: “Promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment and decent work for all” is a further example. Evidence shows that MSEs are the main drivers of economic growth and trade. By enhancing access to finance for MSEs and providing them with crucial non-financial services to support their growth, these programs are crucial for achieving this goal. 
 
Actions taken by the Egyptian Government in order to reduce poverty include among others a number of plans and programs aimed at expanding social protection and effectively tackle the multifaceted vulnerabilities and build resilience of the Egyptian population and accelerate poverty reduction in a sustainable manner, these includes among others; 
1. Increasing the Social Security Pension.  
2. Establishing logistics hubs for grain trade and storage to contribute to food security  
3. Amending the Social Insurance Law to provide self-employed social insurance to farmers with more than one faddan acquisitions.  
4. Reform of its fuel and food subsidy system 
5. Introduction of a Unified National Registry to develop a single unified database for social security and linking social assistance to a smart card to simplify access and enhance efficiency.  
6. The Ministry for Social Solidarity (MoSS), has developed and actively pursuing many programs directed toward those who are less privilege, under three main pillars,  
a. Social Protection, that includes all forms of assistance to those in need, such as child monthly financial assistance, and financial assistance for those who are affected by drought and desertification phenomenon. 
b. Social development, to assist in developing the capabilities and capacities of families to provide a pathway toward graduating extreme poverty and ensure a constant stream of income, such as productive families programs, and   vocational centers.  
c. Social Care, programs specially designed for the services provided to women; children, the elderly, and those with special needs. 
7. Another major national program that is directed to less privileged people is the "Social Housing Program" through the Ministry of Housing and New Communities (MHNC). This program aims at providing a decent home for those with low income. The project aims at providing one million housing units for low-income citizens in all Governorates with a total cost of LE 150 billion during 5 years. 
8. To overcome the random housing areas problem, a major national initiative is in process as a cooperative effort between the Government and civil society. Its first and second phase finished and delivered at the end of May 2016 (Tahya Misr Project, AlAsmrat suburban). 
9. Launching a comprehensive action plan to develop poorest villages.  
 
To overcome the key inefficiency, targeting and coordination challenges arising from existing forms of social protection, the Government has embarked upon a gradual shift from in-kind towards cash and semi cash transfer programs, which have globally proven to be have a higher poverty reduction impact.  
 
Cash and Semi-Cash Transfer Programs: 
(a) Cash Transfer Programs: Based on savings generated from the reform of Egypt’s fuel and food subsidy programmes, the Government is planning to step up its support to social protection by expanding old social security programmes and introducing new approaches in areas of cash transfer.  
• Social Solidarity cash transfer scheme (Old): Currently covering 1.5 million families (and the number will be increased to 3 million) with a total annual allocation of LE 6.3 billion, the scheme primarily targets marginalized segments of society, such as the divorced or widowed, orphans and senior citizens. 
• Takaful and Karama cash transfer schemes (New): A a new cash transfer programme has been launched, where poor families will be able to receive an equivalent of $43-$83 a month based on the number of children and dependent on conditionalities, while some elderly people and people with disabilities receives $47 a month. Takaful provides support to poor families conditional on the child’s school attendance, on medical check-ups for mothers and children under 6 and on attending nutrition classes. Karama provides unconditional income support to the elderly and people with disabilities. Some half a million people have been supported by the Takaful and Karama programmes by March 2016 and the programmes hope to reach some 1.5 million families by 2017.  
 (b) Semi Cash Transfer Programs: Food subsidy Reforms 
Budget allocations to the food and bread subsidy schemes have more than doubled from LE 17.7 billion in FY09/10 to LE 36.1 billion in FY13/14 with limited translation to improved living standards. To address this, the Ministry of Supply has overhauled the bread subsidy scheme and shifted it towards a points based system that is strongly integrated with ration cards. The Government no longer rations specific quantities of chosen products (such as cooking oil and sugar) but provides direct, semi-cash transfers for each ration card in the worth of LE 15 per person per month. Within this system, beneficiaries may decide their own consumption patterns by choosing among 54 products. With regards to bread, the subsidy is now provided at the final stage of the production, ending the dual pricing of wheat and other inputs. The new scheme, which has so far been applied to 17 (out of 27) Governorates, is expected to suppress leakage and save 20-30percent of wheat purchases. 
Preliminary indicators point to positive public reception due to uninterrupted service provision, improved quality of bread and enhanced consumer flexibility. The program is a constituent element of a broader strategy to improve supply distribution networks and has been nationally rolled-out by the last quarter of 2015. 
Box 3 
Improving Health Standards to Advance Poverty Reduction 
Good health and well-being are one of the main pillars of a strong society and an inherent human right. The relationship between poverty and ill-health is clear and supported by international evidence. Therefore, Improving health standards is a critical step towards achieving poverty eradication. Egypt’s Constitution affirmed the universal right to healthcare, where Article 18 states that each citizen has the right to enjoy a healthy life and to receive comprehensive healthcare in line with quality standards. The Constitution also declares that the State shall allocate percentage of GDP, not less than 3 percent, on health, which is twice the current governmental expenditure on the health sector. The Ministry of Health and Population has defined strategic objectives in the area of health to be achieved by 2030, which primarily focus on:  
1- The improvement of the health of citizens within a framework of justice and equity: The objective is to have all the factors affecting the health of Egyptians including social factors and general awareness. So the Ministry of Health and Population focuses on the provision and enhancement of primary healthcare through awareness and preventive measures.  
2- Achieve universal healthcare coverage for all Egyptians and ensure high quality services: The objective includes three elements of healthcare service delivery including financial burden, accessibility, and quality. However, this provision of quality healthcare service requires the increase of healthcare expenditure, the contribution of different entities, and the accessibility of these financial resources.  
3- Improve health sector governance: The objective is to ensure the availability of accurate data, improvement of efficiency, accountability, transparency and resource management of the health sector.  
 
 
SDG 11: Make Cities Inclusive, Safe, Resilient and Sustainable 
 
 
 
 
 National Urban Policy (NUP)
The NUP, which is currently being prepared under the supervision of the Ministry of 
Housing, is tackling urban development from a multi-dimensional perspective. In the Egyptian context, the first initiation of preparing a NUP for Egypt has been formally introduced jointly by the Ministry of Housing, Utilities, and Urban Development (MHUUD/GOPP) and UN-Habitat in an expert group meeting in June 2015. In addition, the discussion was developed further in one of the sessions of the First Egypt Urban Forum (EUF), organized by MHUUD, Ministry of State for Urban Renewal and Informal Settlements (MURIS), and UN-Habitat. 
Given the multi-level facets of the urbanization process, the institutional framework for the formulation and implementation of urban development policy requires intra- and interinstitutional coordination. Initially only key institutions would be working together. These can be envisaged as the ministries in charge of infrastructure, local Government, economy and finance, environment and natural resources, trade and commerce, agriculture, in addition to private-sector enterprises and civil society associations. 
The new NUP is a participatory process and all urban stakeholders have been involved in the design and implementation of the coordination framework. These actors include various ministerial departments, local authorities, private sector, civil society organizations and research. The NUP is meant to serve as a compass for line ministries and local authorities to guide coherent decision-making processes. Moreover, the formulation of the policy should be supported by a defined monitoring plan with indicators and targets that could be disaggregated by sectors and actors. 
The NUP is a framework that provides an overarching coordination/integration to address urban challenges, maximize the benefits of urbanization, while mitigating potential adverse externalities. The NUP for Egypt can be considered a policy document to guide the next 30 to 50 years of urban development, and direct the future utilization the national territory in regard to the distribution of population and job-creation opportunities, infrastructure supply, improvement of living standards, management of natural resources, and conservation of the environment. Therefore, it can be considered as an “umbrella policy” that regulates and directs other developmental and public policies on integrated urban-related matters.  
The vision of the NUP can be stated as: “Fostering coordinated urbanization for sustainable economic opportunities, social welfare and better urban environment.” – which is oriented at the SDG indicators. 
The overall intent of the policy is to generate vibrant urban environments and sustainable economic growth aligned with the implementation of the SDGs. Egypt’s future urban agenda will encourage multi-institutional cooperation, gender equality and women’s empowerment, development of spatially balanced development, population growth of uninhabited new settlements and new developmental projects, spreading urban areas in frontier regions, protecting valuable agricultural land, provision of ample regional and local social services and transport facilities, and friendly well-managed cities.  
The NUP is foreseen to be a means to merge local issues with global challenges to provide a framework for achieving the SDGs by 2030, and the African Union Agenda by 2063, while also aligning with the road map for urban development of the Egypt. Goal 11 of the SDGs proposes to “make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. 
National Urban Policy (NUP). Dimensions constituting the rationale for formulating a new NUP for Egypt are envisaged as follows: 
▪ Need to deal with persistent urbanization problems such as regional imbalances, polarization, and over-urbanization; 
▪ 	Guiding future urban growth;  
▪ 	NUP as an integral part of urban national strategic plans and strategies; 
▪ 	Leverage on national mega projects; 
▪ Fostering the global new paradigm shift towards integrated regional and city development; and 
▪ 	Serving as a platform to strengthen participation and collaboration 
 
City Prosperity Index (CPI) 
The first City Prosperity Index is currently being computed for a representative sample of 35 Egyptian cities. The index will help to review progress of the SDGs disaggregated along regions.  Plans are set up to institutionalize the CPI to calculate it regularly. In addition, the Ministry of Local Development will organize regular evaluation meetings with the governors to integrate local views on the progress in implementing the SDGs. 
The CPI is a composite index made of six dimensions: infrastructure, productivity, quality of life, equity, environmental sustainability and governance. However, these dimensions and indicators can be adjusted to specific needs, e.g. the monitoring of the SDG indicators. The CPI is built based on a sound statistical approach that integrates various indicators to the different dimensions of shared prosperity and sustainability.  The CPI will offer the possibility to adopt a city-wide approach to development beyond the sectorial nature of the SDG indicators and at the same time it will also offer the possibility of individual disaggregation of indicators. It also offers the possibility of computing city and country aggregated values. This will enhance monitoring capacities and will increase the prospects of higher accountability in the implementation of the SDGs. 
In Egypt, the City Prosperity Index is currently being computed for a representative sample of 35 Egyptian cities. This first CPI in Egypt is serving as a test version that allows to make out an effective and efficient methodology to gather data from various sources on the local level. It also can be considered as a pilot project from which evidence is gained where data gathering has to be improved. In the upcoming years, the CPI will regularly be computed to track the implementation of the SDGs according to different regions in Egypt. It will allow to make out regional differences and give evidence where efforts have to be done more focused to improve performance in the SDG indicators. Also, it offers for the central Government a framework indicating the need for further action in terms of regions. Based on the first CPI in Egypt, an institutional framework will be developed to systematize a regular calculation of the CPI in order to support monitoring and reporting on the SDGs. 
 
Egypt Urban Forum (EUF) 
The EUF is a platform that brings together biannually representatives from the Government, CSOs, private sector, international experts, academia, and other development partners to discuss national urban policies, challenges in the field of urban development and innovative urban development practices. The Forum also functions as a platform to assess the state of the art of sustainable urban development. The EUF has been unique due to its participatory process. Several preparatory meetings across state agencies and regions were held in the lead up to the first Egypt Urban Forum. The first EUF has been taking place in 2015 with not less than 700 participants including top decision makers, such as ministers, head of public agencies and authorities, senior officials of the Government, representatives of local authorities, scholars, think tanks members, professors, trainers, architects, urban planners, artists and designers, civil society activists, local communities, youth, media, private sector companies as well as foreign scholars, civil servants, professionals and officials of international organizations and city networks.   
To prepare for the very first edition of the EUF, a Steering Committee (SC) was formed,  based on a balanced representation of governmental and non-governmental entities, mandated to lead the preparatory process, determine the scope and the substance of the event and take all important decisions. The SC comprised twenty prominent specialists in the realm of urban development and whose background reflect a great variety of expertise, including academics, civil society activists and advisors to the Government as well as senior officials of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Communities and Ministry of Urban Renewal and Informal Settlements. The SC started its work nearly a year before the date of the Forum. Following lengthy and lively discussions throughout six meetings, the SC decided on the Forum objectives, structure and program. Five thematic meetings were held with academia, civil society, public entities, youth, women and heritage institutions.  
Finally, the media were expected to play a major role in informing the public about issues of the Forum. Four meetings including a media briefing and a curtain raiser mobilized up to fifty media organizations and raised the profile of urban issues in the public debate. 
During the first EUF in 2015, participants in the Forum agreed to issue the Cairo Decleration, targeting the Egyptian public, the Government and civil society organizations concerned with urban issues as well as the relevant international organizations. It set out to define the major issues of urbanization in Egypt and the principles to guide future urbanization efforts in the country. It also formulated a number of recommendations to facilitate sound urban development. 
The next EUF in 2017 will be intensively used to disseminate the findings and the state of the SDGs that are related to urban development. The gathering of the various stakeholders bears the opportunity to discuss the challenges that hinder the implementation or monitoring of the SDGs from multiple perspectives. A declaration can be used to agree upon a common roadmap or process to improve the implementation of the SDGs. 
 
Strategic Plans (SP) 
Piloting the implementation of SDGs in one Governorate. One of the main instruments for physical planning on the local level are General Strategic Plans. These are prepared by the General Organization for Physical Planning (GOPP) for all Egyptian Governorates, cities and villages. The strategic plan is a developmental plan setting up a vision for the future development of the city, village or Governorate until 2027. It describes challenges, opportunities and priorities as well as priority areas for investments and projects. The strategic plan is developed in a participatory process in close cooperation with the local Government, local administration and local civil society. 
The strategic plan of the GOPP and the Governorate of Qena agreed to pilot the localization of the SDGs as one of the outputs of undertaking a strategic plan for the Governorate. Also the GOPP is also exploring the possibility of ruling this out in the process of undertaking Governorate, city and villages strategic plans. This means that there will be awareness campaigns among relevant stakeholders in the Governorate highlighting the importance of the SDGs. Then, an assessment of the current performance of the Governorate in the SDG indicators will be conducted. The vision for the Governorate of Qena will then be aligned with the SDGs. The strategic plan will then outline how the SDGs could be implemented in the Governorate highlighting priority projects and investments. 
The pilot project will show to what extent strategic plans can be used as a mean to implement the SDGs. At the same time, it will propose a methodology on how the SDGs can be streamlined in plans for the local level. It will also provide insights for the central level on how to implement the SDGs on different levels of government. 
National Observatories (NO) 
National observatories have been established in the General Organization for Physical Planning, the Ministry of Local Development, the Ministry of Planning and the Ministry of Housing. The mandate of these observatories is to gather primary and secondary data, to analyze the data and publish it upon request. They play a crucial role in supporting the said ministries in monitoring the SDGs.   
Through various capacity building measures, the national observatories are now equipped to function as highly efficient agencies supporting monitoring of the SDGs. Their function could be to add to the data gathered by the census and CAPMAS and to focus on data that needs primary data gathering. An example is data on public spaces or land consumption ratio that need GIS and aerial photo analysis. 
New Towns (NT) 
Renewing concepts of establishing new towns. Egypt already has established and developed 23 new towns, 5 of which have not been inhabited yet. The original and adjusted designation programs for these new towns have targeted that they will accommodate at least 11 million inhabitants by 2012 (the original target year for many first-generation new towns such as Tenth of Ramadan), and 21 million inhabitants by 2032. However, the new towns hardly absorbed 0.85 million inhabitants in the official census at 2006, and absorbed up to 5.4 million in 2013, according to NUCA estimates. This implies that new towns were able to house roughly 5 million new settlers in the last few years without developing further new areas within their built up areas. The new towns have a maximum bearing capacity to receive further 15.6 million inhabitants in the next 17 years. That is roughly equal to the capacity of all existing urban and rural settlements in Egypt, and reflects the principle role of new towns in the future urbanization process in Egypt. 
To reach the said target, the way of establishing and designing new towns have to be reformed. A pilot project introducing the fourth generation of new towns is currently being conducted. The new town of EL Alamein near the North Cost at the Mediterranean Sea is designed as a smart city with a distinct economic profile. Therefore, an economic feasibility study was conducted indicating opportunities, business models and risks regarding the new town’s economy. Economic factors have thus been taken into consideration from an early stage on. At the same time, an assessment of the social and environmental impacts of the city has been done to ensure its sustainability.  
Slum Areas and Informal Settlements Development 
The development of slum areas and informal settlements is a cornerstone of achieving SDG11 and has been set as one of the main priorities of the Government. Several efforts have been exerted in that regard in order to provide safe and suitable living conditions for the inhabitants of these areas.  An “Informal Settlements Development Facility (ISDF)” was established as a fund to support local government in the provision of safe housing, with a priority given to the eradication and development of slum areas. The scope of work of the ISDF ensures that its development system can achieve the SDGs, providing not only a safe and healthy home, but also enhancing the quality of life and eradicate extreme poverty for people who live in these areas.  
The development policies of the ISDF support the the principle of human-based development for achieving social justice. Slum development strategies include;  
• Relocation of inhabitants of life-threatening areas such as the relocation of inhabitants from Al-Dowaiqa and Istabl Antar to 6th October city at Cairo, Al-Hadba Alsinaia to Alexandira, as well as providing compensation to these individuals;  
• Transfer or converting HVC electric cables to ground cables in cooperation with the Ministry  of  Electricity and Energy and local government (such as in Al-Bosilia in Aswan), to avoid health risks. 
• Upgrading of factories that emit pollution in the vicinity of inhabited areas in cooperation between the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Industry. 
• establishment of water and sanitation systems within the national plan of the Ministry of Water and Sanitation Facilities (such as in O’lwayat Al-Sawy, Azbat Ma’mon and Muhammed Meshraf in Al-Fayoum). 
• Development of a pilot project in 17 slum areas in Cairo and 13 slum areas in Giza and Helwan, with the support of the private sector, focusing on the the building of roads and pedestrian corridors, providing lighting and upgrading landscape, as well as providing basic infrastructure such as sewage, electricity, fresh water and fire fighting systems. 
• Development of informal markets and job creation in slum areas and informal settlements through socio-economic programs.  
These development also feed into several other SDGs in addition to SDG11. For example, efforts to develop informal markets and create job opportunities in slum areas through socioeconomic programs are directly related to SDG 1 to end poverty and SDG8 to promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment and decent work for all. The establishment of water and sanitation systems and of appropriate infrastructure for sewage systems feeds into Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation (Ensure access to water and sanitation for all) 
 
SDG 13: Take Urgent Action To Combat Climate Change and its Impacts 
 
The Climate Change Challenge 
 
 
 
 
Current situation10   
Although Egypt’s contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is only 0.6 percent19 of the total, it is nevertheless highly vulnerable to the risks of climate change. 
According to studies by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), it is likely that in the future a sizable part of the northern Nile Delta will be lost to a combination of inundation and erosion, with consequent loss of both agricultural land and urban areas.  The assessment of the agricultural sector’s vulnerability to climate change is based on the findings of the major negative impacts are expected through: 
• The expected rise in temperature and change of its seasonal pattern would lead to decreasing the productivity of some crops and livestock, as well as a change in environmental agricultural zones; 
• Marginal agricultural areas would be negatively affected, and desertification rates would increase; 
• Higher temperatures would increase water evaporation and water consumption; 
• Socio-economic effects such as labour migration from marginal and coastal areas; and 
• The probable rise in sea water level, and its negative effects on coastal areas, tourism and agricultural land in the Delta area." 
For the Governorate of Alexandria, two main economic areas appear most vulnerable: the Alexandria lowlands and the Alexandria beaches (El-Raey et al., 1995). The Alexandria lowlands, on which the city of Alexandria was originally established, are vulnerable to inundation, waterlogging, increased flooding, and salinization under accelerated sea-level rise. The two surviving Alexandria beaches (Gleam and El-Chatby) will be lost even with a rise in sea levels of just half a meter. Based on the half-meter scenario, estimated losses of land, installations, and tourism will exceed $32.5 billion. An average business loss is estimated at $127 million/year because most tourist facilities such as hotels and camps are located within 200-300 meters of the shoreline. It has been widely reported that 8 million people would be displaced in Egypt by a one-meter rise in sea level. 
2 The Climate Change Challenge: The Egyptian Constitution  
Article 46: The Environment  
Every individual has the right to live in a healthy, sound and balanced environment. Its protection is a national duty. The state is committed to taking the necessary measures to preserve it, avoid harming it, rationally use its natural resources to ensure that sustainable development is achieved, and guarantee the rights of future generations thereto.

5. The Climate Change Challenge: Egypt's Efforts to Combat Climate Change  
To meet climate change challenges, Egypt has carried out considerable efforts on the international, regional and national level.   
At the international level, Egypt signed the United Nation Framework Convention on Climate Change on 9 June 1992 and the convention was ratified by the parliament on 5 December 1994.  Egypt signed the Kyoto Protocol in 1999 which entered into force on 12 April 2005. More recently, Egypt has agreed to the Paris agreement known as COP21 which was signed on 22 April 2016 at the general conference of the United Nations headquarters in New York, and this is now awaiting the ratification of Egypt’s parliament. Egypt also submitted its INDCs in November 2015. 
At the regional level, the Egyptian position on climate change negotiations was compatible with the position of developing countries in general, and the rest of the African continent in particular. Egypt headed the African delegation negotiating before and during COP21 in Paris from 2015 to 2016.Egypt was able to build consensus on several principles among the African countries, including: adaptation to climate change risks and facing the threats of climate change as a first priority; participation in the international efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is based on Common But Differentiated Responsibility (CBDR) and reduction efforts must be consistent with national circumstance; sustainable development ambitions require providing the necessary funding, national capacity building and technology transfer through the means of implementation of the international mechanisms stipulated in Article 4 of the Framework Convention on Climate Change and Article 9 of the Paris Agreement. In addition, Egypt led two important initiatives in 2015; the first is the African Renewable Energy Initiative (AREI) and the second is the African Adaptation Initiative (AAI) to support the region to face  the adverse effects of climate change.  
At the national level, Egypt issued its first National Communication reporting 1999, and the second in 2010. At present the third national communication report is finalized and awaiting promulgation. In 2011, Egypt prepared a national adaptation strategy that surveyed all the risks the country will face due to climate change as well as plans of how to adapt to those risks. Egypt also submitted its INDC to the UNFCCC in November 2015 and Egypt has recently started to work on the Biennial Update Report (BUR) on its greenhouse gas inventories.  
Furthermore, in 2013, Egypt prepared a study on climate change risk management with the cooperation of the ministries of agriculture, irrigation and the environment, resulting in important recommendations in relation to the development of seeds capable of withstanding high temperatures and also in the field of modern irrigation. In 2015, Egypt conducted a study evaluating opportunities to reduce greenhouse gases in various sectors such as energy, tourism and agriculture. Recently, Egypt has created units to deal with the issue of climate change within the different ministries, such as the Renewable Energy Center for Climate Change in the Ministry of Agriculture, the Climate Change Research Centre in the Ministry of Irrigation, and the General Management of Energy Efficiency and Climate Change at the Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy. A sustainable development unit was also established at the Ministry of Environment to foster implementation of the sustainable development strategy and the SDGs. In 2015, Egypt established the National Council on Climate Change including representatives from all ministries and departments to discuss relevant climate change developments and to link national climate plans with the SDGs. Finally, through a Prime Ministerial decree, the Ministry of Environment established the Waste Management Regulatory Agency in order to develop an integrated waste management systems for solid, Agricultural and Hazarders waste to reduce emissions caused by unsafe disposal of waste  
 
Egypt has also carried out a number of projects and actions related to climate change: 
• A total of 24 clean development mechanism projects were established the International Executive Board during the period from 2006 to 2015, with a total investment of $522 million (six projects on  renewable energy, four on industrial development, two on solid waste, one for transportation, six for fuel switching and six for energy efficiency). These projects issued around USD 10 million-worth of Certificates of Emission Reduction (CERs).   
• Increased resilience for food security in Upper Egypt to face the extreme weather events in 14 poor villages.  
• Walls were built to protect beaches on the north coast against sea level rises. 
 
For the upcoming fiscal year of 2016/2017, there are plans for the following actions: 
• Updating the national strategy for adaptation to climate change and integrating the adaptation activities within the draft budget for fiscal year 2016/2017. It has been allocated about LE520 million for projects designed for rehabilitation of irrigation facilities to support the High Dam and the Egyptian beaches against see level rise.  
• Upgrading of subway lines, leading to a reduction of greenhouse gases and in line with the state's plan to rationalize the use of fuel. Allocation of LE5,082 million pounds. 
 Box 4
Key ODA-Funded Projects Advancing the SDGs—Expanding the Usage of Clean  and Efficient Energy 
Promoting the use of clean and efficient energy is at the forefront of Egypt’s priorities. The Government has set the target to increase the share of renewable energy consumption to 20 percent by the Year 2022. To advance these efforts, the Ministry of International Cooperation has forged strategic partnerships with development partners who are leading in this field, including the JICA, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), AfD; Islamic Development Bank, AfDB, the Republic of China, Germany, and the European Union. Support leveraged from these partners has led to the establishment of several renewable energy plants, especially solar and wind plants, in several locations across the country including Upper Egypt, Suez, and Red Sea, based on feasibility studies conducted in collaboration with several IFIs including the World Bank and the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development. The objectives of these projects are increasing the supply of power, stabilizing the national grid and promoting the use of renewable energy, thereby promoting socioeconomic development and mitigating climate change, as well as an indirect but noteworthy impact on employment creation. In that sense, they are contributing to the advancement of Goal 7,  “Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all”; Goal 11, “Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable”; and Goal 12, “Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.” 
In this regard, in the area of financing, it is important to activate SDG 17; targets 17.2, 17.3, and 17.4 link to Article 4, paragraph 3 and Article 7, paragraph 2 (h), of the UNFCCC, to Article 12 in the Kyoto Protocol, and to Article 9 in the Paris agreement on climate change. 
Another point worth mentioning is that it that the priority is to attract foreign direct investment, while keeping in mind that loans are necessary for priority sectors where urgent support is required. In the field of capacity building it is important to activate target 17.9 with Article 11 of the Paris agreement on climate change. In the field of technology transfer it is important to activate targets from 17.6 to 17.8 along with UNFCCC Article 4, paragraph (c) and (g), and Paris agreement Article 10. There is also a need for some new, amended legislation to ensure the integration of governance dimensions, which require major capacity building in this field.  
During the Paris agreement on climate change, it was put forward that the financial needs of Egypt to adapt with the risks of climate change and contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gases exceed $70 billion, in addition to the need to develop and enhance management and follow-up systems and government. This can be achieved through twinning programs with similar entities in developed countries as one of the required support mechanisms in the field of capacity building. 
There also exists a need for rehabilitation specialists to increase the efficiency of allocating external funding for the necessary projects and linking these project models wherever possible with regional projects, particularly in the energy field, to take advantage of electrical connections.  
 
 
3.5 Analysis of the HLPF 2016 Theme ‘Ensuring that no one is left behind’: 
Introduction 
Empowering people is an essential and cross-cutting element of all SDGs; in that vein and in accordance with the Egyptian constitution11, the Government of Egypt has adopted a comprehensive approach to ensure full inclusion of all citizens, irrespective of gender, social class, location, ability, or migrant status. The following are some examples of current initiatives regarding those groups which might be at risk of being left behind, including women, children, people with special needs, young people, those under the poverty line, and refugees.  
A. 	Women 
There is a large and growing understanding of the need to empowerment women and enhance gender equality in Egypt. Along this line, there has been concrete effort by the Egyptian Government to cooperate with national and international stakeholders to promote women’s empowerment and ensure that women are not left behind in the development process, following are some examples: 
• In 2000, the National Council for Women (NCW) was established by Presidential Decree. The NCW is a national mechanism that falls directly under the supervision of the president, whereby the council proposes public policies for women's advancement and sets plans for their implementation, monitoring and evaluation with a view on women’s development and empowerment in the social, economic and political fields. The NCW, with the support of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), adjusted the method of generating the national plans for social and economic development in order to include women and introduce the concept of gender into the process of national development planning. In addition, the concept of gender-responsive state budgets has been helpful, and has a particular impact on the follow-up and evaluation processes. New, nonconventional indicators for measuring gender equality in areas of work, health, education and political rights have also been developed. Any transfers of allocations made for women’s projects in favor of any other project are prohibited. The NCW has also exerted a great deal of effort in the fight against female genital mutilation (FGM), as well as in helping women in rural areas to obtain Government identity cards  
• Article 11 of the constitution obliges the Government to take the necessary actions to empower women. As a result, women currently represent about 16 percent of parliamentarians for the first time (87 members), and have a quota in municipality elections (25 percent)19.  
• The Ministry of Family and Population through its National Population Council has been working with UN partners including UNDP, United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF), UNFPA and UN Women to empower families and communities to abandon the practice of FGM in Egypt. Egypt continues to have a high rate of FGM, which is a form of violence against women and its practice is a deterrent to gender equality and women’s empowerment. The practice also has a profound influence on a girl-child’s development throughout her life. While FGM remained as unbroken taboo for many years in Egypt, there has been significant change to the perceptions of FGM in the society due to courageous action taken by the Government, civil society and UN partners. Due to these efforts, Egypt has seen a gradual decrease in its FGM rate from 75 percent in 2008 to reach 61 percent in 2014. (This is in line with SDGs Target 
                                                           
5.3: Eliminate all harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation.)  
 
 
 
• Equal Opportunities Units were created within different ministries at the proposal of the NCW. The units directly follow the ministers' offices and their main function is to focus on the constitutional equality between men and women in the workplace and address any discriminatory employment practices against women, and to provide legal awareness programs and support the rights of working women and help them get the necessary training and promotion opportunities. For example, the Equal Opportunities Unit at the Ministry of Finance, in cooperation with the NCW and with the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women), focuses on spreading the concept of gender-responsive budgeting among the ministry employees, and in particular among the officials responsible for preparing the draft state budget.  
• The Salheya Initiative has been identified as an opportunity to provide a model of an integrated strategy for enhancing women’s economic participation, as well as for scaling up the gender equity seal certification process. In partnership with the Ministry of Manpower and Immigration and the Social Research Center of the American University in Cairo, the project aims to enhance the participation of young, unemployed women with medium and higher education in the economy and to improve their security and rights. 
• Social, economic and legal empowerment of Egyptian women: In 2015, a joint programme was launched in partnership between the UN and relevant Government agencies focused on the social, economic and legal empowerment of women. The Programme is managed by UNDP, UN Women, UNFPA works together with 
Government counterparts Ministry of International Cooperation, National Population Council, Social Fund for Development, Ministry of Social Solidarity, the National 
Council for Women and others to promote women’s empowerment in various dimensions. This joint programme aims to address specific hurdles faced by Egyptian women in order to encourage women’s equal participation in society based on citizenship rights by implementing an integrated approach.  
• Furthermore, while Egypt has achieved commendable progress with regards to women’s empowerment, with notable successes in increasing girls’ access to education, a drastic reduction in the practice of female genital mutilation among young girls, and a historic milestone in the numbers of women elected to parliament (from 2 percent in 2011 to 14.9 percent in 2015), there are still barriers impeding women and girls from realizing their potential as powerful agents of social and economic progress; in particular, the share of women in wage employment in the non-agricultural sector was only 19.2 percent of the total wage earners at the national level12, compared with an international average of 40 percent during 2012/2013.  
 
B. 	Children 
Article 80 of the Egyptian constitution states that the Government is obliged to ensure children, who make up approximately 31 percent13 of the population14, are provided with their needs. The following are some of the key measures taken by the Egyptian Government in cooperation with national and international stakeholders in the field of childhood to ensure that they are not negatively impacted or left behind in the development process. 
• Egypt has established the survival and development of children at the center of the nation’s policy agenda, as it considers the wellbeing of children to be a sensitive indicator of overall sustainable social development. Egypt was among the first 20 countries to ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and helped develop a consensus on the Convention among those countries where Sharia (Islamic law) forms the basis of legal norms and practices. Today, the Convention has become one of the most ratified treaties of the United Nations. Egypt has also served as one of the Six Initiator Countries for the World Summit for Children, and has taken its leadership responsibilities very seriously.   
• In 1998, Egypt established the National Council for Childhood and Motherhood (NCCM), the national authority entrusted with policymaking, planning, coordination, monitoring and evaluation of activities in the areas of protection and development of children, as well as those of safe motherhood. 
• The Egypt National Child Rights Observatory (ENCRO) contributes to the initiative "Egypt Fit for Children" whereby the rights of every child are respected, promoted and protected. To achieve these goals, ENCRO helps in building the capacities of the NCCM’s departments and core functions (namely policy and planning, monitoring and evaluation, data and documentation and research) in order to strengthen the council's capabilities and abilities to coordinate, develop, monitor and advocate for more accountable, transparent and participatory public policies for children. 
• There is an ongoing presidential initiative, under the auspices of the Tahya Misr charitable foundation, to eliminate the phenomenon of homeless children. This initiative aims to protect around 80 percent of homeless children by providing livelihood and rehabilitation services, to include around 60 percent in foster homes and families, and to establish an observatory to monitor and follow up and measuring changes in this social dilemma.  
• A collaborative initiative to counter violence against children was established by the National Council for Childhood and Motherhood, the Ministry of Social Solidarity, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Interior and USAID. The main goal of the initiative is to provide capacity building for the  
“General Protection Committees” at the sub-national and local levels to be able to identify the possible cases of violence against children and work toward resolving issues before becoming chronic. 
• A national initiative, "Educating Girls", was established, aiming to raise the number of girls enrolled in the different levels of education, and decreasing the number of drop-outs. The initiative is a cooperation between the National Council for Childhood and Motherhood and the UNICEF.  
• In 2015 a number of specially designed programs were established under the name “Takaful" (“solidarity”). The programs target poor families with children and provides them with conditional financial support. To receive support, families have to ensure their children’s school attendance is at 80 percent and above for children aged 6-18, and mothers with children below six will have to make two visits a year to health clinics. They will also have to attend nutrition awareness sessions promoting better child feeding practices, regular immunization, and antennal and postnatal care. The main aim of the programme is to reduce poverty and produce human development improvements in areas of health and education, especially for children in vulnerable and poor households. 
 
C. 	Youth 
The constitution in its preamble acknowledges the role of the Egyptian youth, who became the focus of much attention after leading the push for change during the 2011 and 2013 uprisings. The Government of Egypt is strongly committed to tapping on the generational dividend and unlocking the vast potential presented by its large youth population. People under 35 years old make up the majority of the Egyptian population, at 68.7 percent15, and youth empowerment and participation in shaping the future have therefore became primary concerns of the current leadership.  According to Population Council surveys of young people in Egypt24 which were conducted in 2009 and 2014, before and after the uprisings, Egyptian young people today are: much more likely to vote; more likely to use the internet and other media; less likely to work for the Government or in the private sector; less likely to aspire to migrate outside of Egypt; more likely to prefer a larger family size and less likely to use contraception. 
Below are some of the relevant actions taken to empower young people. 
• To ensure that the youth not left behind in the development process, the constitution demands that the Government provide all required provisions for them (in Articles 29 and 82) to ensure their engagement in all aspects of social and economic arenas, and specifies a special quota in the parliament, which resulted in a total of 10 percent of elected MPs being under the age of 35. There is also a quota of 25 percent under-35s for municipality elections, to ensure young people’s active participation in forming the political agenda. 
• The presidential declaration that 2016 is the "Year of Youth" is recognition of their role, and that, as the president said, "hope and youth" are synonymous.  
• The Presidential Leadership Program (PLP) is a custom-designed program to prepare the youth for leadership. It aims to raise young people’s awareness of politics and development. 
• The Youth Employment National Action Plan (YENAP) aims at increasing youth employment by providing decent and productive jobs for young people.  The Central Bank of Egypt’s (CBE) implemented an initiative to support youth employment through small and medium enterprises, opening a line of credit worth LE200 billion, with a very low interest rate of 5 percent. The initiative aim is to encourage young entrepreneurs to start their own business and help existing ones to expand, which is expected to create new job opportunities and lessen the unemployment rate specifically among youth.  D) Persons with disabilities 
Article 81 of Egypt's 2014 constitution states: "The State shall guarantee the health, economic, social, cultural, entertainment, sporting and educational rights of persons with disabilities strive to provide them with job opportunities, allocate a percentage of job opportunities to them, and adapt public facilities and their surrounding environment to their special needs. The State shall also ensure their exercise of all political rights and integration with other citizens in compliance with the principles of equality, justice and equal opportunities." Seven other articles in the 2014 constitution also directly and indirectly target persons with disabilities, protecting their rights to equal health care, employment, education, political participation, and social inclusion. Listed below are several other efforts and initiatives in that regard.  
• Ministerial Decree No. 42 of 2015 calls for the implementation of including students with minor disabilities in the general school system, in addition to accepting students with hearing impairments in Egyptian universities as per the decision of the High Council of Universities.  
• Many legislations and decisions were advocated by the National Council for Disability Affairs (NCDA), which was established as a specialized entity to deal with disability affairs in April 2012. The NCDA contributes to the inclusion of PwDs in national strategies notably on health, housing, education, employment, and rights of the mother and child. Data on PwDs will be included for the first time in the national census to be implemented in 2016.  
• In 2015, the “Karama” (Dignity) program was launched, providing unconditional financial support programs for those who are underprivileged, namely the elderly and those who are fully disabled. The main aim of the programs is to eliminate absolute poverty and cover the basic needs of the elderly and people with disabilities. 
• The Ministry of Housing is allocating of 5 percent of the national project on public housing to PwDs and initiatives are underway to establish four accessible cities near Qena, Ismailia, Alexandria and Cairo. 
• The Egyptian Government is working toward devising its strategy and developing a new disability law in line with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) to support and empower people with disabilities. 
• The Egypt Information and Communication Technology Trust Fund (ICT-TF), jointly established by the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MCIT) and the UNDP, has several IT training and educational programs targeting people with disabilities in about 112 slum areas in Cairo. 
• Within the regional program to develop South Sinai Governorate in cooperation with the EU, the first advanced center for people with disabilities in the city of Tor South Sinai Governorate is planned. The center will provide 65 job opportunities, 70 percent of which are for people with disabilities. 
• Many service projects have been established in Governorates in Upper Egypt in cooperation with Terre des Homme, to advocate for rights and equal opportunities of PWD, and enhance their talents to enable them to operate and manage small projects for hand crafts. Also related to employment, the Federation of Egyptian Industries’ initiative of “Equal for a better living” which aims at providing 1,000 employment opportunities in private sector for persons with disabilities  
• The allocation of a number of cellblocks for the prisoners with disabilities in three prisons, according to the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MoIA). The three prisons are Wadi AlNatron in Beheira Governorate north of Cairo, Borg al-Arab in Alexandria, and another prison in Upper Egypt is being equipped with the special cellblock. A total of 100 prisoners with disabilities have already been transferred to the special devised cellblocks. 
• Under the framework of United Nations Partnership to Promote the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNPRPD), UNDP, International Labour Organization (ILO), and ICT-TF jointly launched a 2 years project entitled “jobs and skills for persons with disabilities with a focus on ICT-based solutions” in September 2014. The project aims at promoting private labour market inclusion of youth with visual and physical impairments in line with the article 27 of UNCRPD to enable the targeted youth with disabilities to fully exercise their right to work.  
• The Egyptian Government sent the delegation consisting of members of the NCDA and representatives of PwDs in the Parliament to the 9th  session of the Conference of the State Parties (COSP) to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in New York in June 2016. The NCDA formulated a statement under the theme “Implementing the 
2030 Development Agenda for all persons with disabilities: Leaving no one behind”, outlining their programme of action to achieve the SDGs with a special focus on fulfilling the right of PwDs. 
 
D. Refugees 
Egypt was one of the first countries to ratify the 1951 Refugee Convention, and has also ratified its 1967 protocols and the 1969 Organization of African Union Convention on Refugees. The history of refugees in Egypt is considerable, as Egypt has long been a both a transit country and a destination for refugees. As of December 2015, UNHCR registered a total of 180,641 asylum-seekers and refguees including 117,658 Syrians. The Government estimates that an equal number or more Syrians and non-Syrian refugees are unregistered and living in Egypt. The large refugee population presents a significant development challenge and poses a large burden on the country’s public resources, , especially on subsidized goods and services such as electricity, water, gas, and health and education services.  
Below are some of the steps Egypt has taken a number of steps to support refugees and asylum-seekers living in the country.  
• The Government of Egypt has been cooperating with development partners and civil society partners on developing and implementing a holistic and resilience-based approach to respond to the Syrian refugee crisis under the Regional Refugee and Resilience Plan (3RP) for Egypt. The 3RP provide an overarching framework aimed to strengthen protection and support for Syrian refugees and host communities focused in the areas of protection, food, health, education, livelihoods and basic needs, along with community-based interventions to enhance outreach and strengthen service delivery systems in the most impacted Governorates. Furthermore, there is recognition on the importance of creating resilience by strengthening the capacities and resources of individuals, communities and institutions (both public and private) to cope with and recover from current hardship and pressures and to better anticipate and mitigate future shocks and stresses to protect development gains.  
• Under the 3RP framework, the Ministry of Education with support from UN and civil society partners has ensured access of refugees to its school systems. In 2015, a total of 28,500 refugee students received education grants, some 1,300 students received school kits and 152 disabled children received financial assistance to pay school fees, which enabled them to enroll in specialized schools. Furthermore, a total of 155 new classrooms were constructed in public schools, some 433 teachers and teaching staff benefited from training as well as 734 administration staff, to cope with the additional needs and demands and reduce the density in the classrooms in schools with high number of refugee students. In addition, a school feeding programme was started in October 2015 in Damietta and Alexandria to help some 116,500 refugees and Egyptian students to improve their access, attendance and performance in the schools.  
• The Ministry of Health and Population (MoH) offers persons residing in Egypt equal access to primary healthcare and emergency care services, for nationals as for non-nationals. Under the 3RP framework, the MoH and 3RP partners have worked to ensure access and coverage to comprehensive health care services for refugees, while strengthening the national health systems and delivering quality health care. Around 95,000 Primary Healthcare Centre (PHC) consultations have been provided and some 600 staff trained to enhance the response of the health facilities. Over 15 million people across Egypt received the polio immunization vaccine as well.  
• Furthermore, the Government works closely with 3RP partners to ensure proper protection, basic needs and livelihood support to the refugee and host community population. However, due to funding shortfalls, there have been significant reductions in Egypt’s ability to support both the refugee and host community population under the 3RP. There have been significant reductions in education grants and food vouchers and the refugee population overall continues to lack durable solutions and suitable livelihoods options, which poses additional risks. 
Although many efforts are being made, there are still many challenges ahead in the areas discussed above. Much still needs to be done to combat violence against women and children, and gender equality is still at an early phase. Youth problems such the unemployment rate and lack of decent housing must be tackled via creative and innovative new policies. Eliminating extreme poverty will be a major challenge, and given the current national situation, international cooperation is needed to achieve a high rate of economic growth. Those with special needs are still not fully included in society, despite the attempts to raise awareness and build capacity for them and their families, and more progress must be made in this regard. 

Chapter 4: SDGs - Means of Implementation 
Translating Ambitions into Actions 
 
4.1 Introduction  
Successful implementation of the SDGs depends mainly on a comprehensive funding framework that goes beyond official development assistance commitments, and encompasses efficient securing of funding through budget restructuring, attracting Foreign Direct Investment flows, and, strengthening the private sector, and encouraging Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs). In conjunction with public and private funding. In July 2015, the international community agreed to a framework for financing and implementing sustainable development known as the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA). The Action Agenda provided a comprehensive set of policy actions by Member States, with a package of over 100 concrete measures to finance sustainable development, transform the global economy and achieve the SDGs. It puts in place a new global framework for financing sustainable development that aligns all financing flows and policies with economic, social and environmental priorities and ensures that financing is stable and sustainable.  
4.2 Financing the 2030 Agenda 
The Action Agenda established a strong foundation to support implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by securing sources of finance, technology and innovation, and promoting trade and debt sustainability. The Action Agenda also serves as a guideline for actions by all stakeholders, whether governments, international organizations, business sector, civil society, or philanthropists. 
SDG 17 calls on developed countries to activate their commitment to allocate 0.7 percent of their gross national income to official development assistance. It aims for a greater mobilization of domestic resources to reduce dependence on foreign support, as well as enhanced international collaboration in science, technology and innovation, and the promotion of an equitable multilateral trading system. 
In terms of implementation, the national framework agenda, SDS: Egypt’s Vision 2030, is the platform for implementation of the SDGs through capitalizing on its existing institutions. The success in achieving the SDGs will mainly depend on the ability to overcome the challenges outlined by Egypt’s sustainable development strategy.   
The strategy, according to international standards, reflects the highest level of commitment and focus. All pillars have clearly stated and quantifiable time-bound objectives and subobjectives to be achieved by 2030.  Challenges, policies, initiatives and programs, both current and future, were identified. Input, outcome, and strategic, result-based key performance indicators were identified for each pillar. New indicators were suggested and their methodology was defined by all relevant partners. Objectives and indicators cover a wide and balanced spectrum of economic, social and environmental issues. As the present generations impact the future ones, but not vise versa, the Egyptian strategy recognized the rights of future generations as a guiding philosophy to achieve intergenerational equity. 
4.3 Efforts to engage the private sector and civil society  
One of the main goals of Egypt sustainable development strategy, based on the participatory methodology used in preparing the strategy document, was to enable all stakeholders to be part of the planning, preparation, and implementation process, and civil society organizations and the private sector took a leading role. A large number of sessions and workshops were held, with the active participation of experts, academics, representatives of the private sector and of civil society, Government officials and international development institutions during the preparation phase of the strategy. Engaging the private sector and the civil society in planning, implementing, monitoring is therefore a cornerstone of the strategy.  
There are around 40,000 local NGOs registered in the country, and Egypt is described as 
having “one of the largest and most vibrant civil society sectors in the developing world”16. Article 75 of the Egyptian constitution states that "all citizens are permitted to form an NGO, and that organization will acquire legal personality upon notification. Such associations and foundations shall have the right to practice their activities freely, and administrative agencies may not interfere in their affairs or dissolve them, or dissolve their boards of directors or boards of trustees save by a court judgment.” The participation of NGOs in the preparatory phase of the sustainable development strategy shows the change in the attitude of the Government of Egypt toward NGOs, and emphasizes that they will be a key player in the implementation phase of the strategy. A clear example is the Asmarat Housing Project, a partnership between the Government, Al-Orman Society, and the Tahya Misr fund. The Government is also working to activate and enhance the role of NGOs in implementing and achieving the SDGs.    
In an effort to create a better environment for the private sector, the Government in the past 12 years has instituted major reforms, as reflected in the 2016 “Ease of Doing Business” report that noted that Egypt had had the biggest score increase in the Middle East and North Africa17. Below are some examples of the ongoing efforts made to provide an enabling environment for the private sector, which is to be the engine of sustainable growth in Egypt. 
• Introducing the "computerized company contract model" to be used in business incorporation, and creating a single access point for business registration with approval within 24 hours. This “one-stop shop” was accompanied by lower business registration fees and a reduction in the minimum capital requirement.  
• There have been several major legislative and institutional reforms in relation to the investment climate, and these measures have had a tangible impact on both the level of domestic investments as well as on the inflows of foreign direct investment; this has strengthened the level of confidence in the Egyptian economy, as has the key role played by the Government of Egypt, in terms of improving the outlook for Egyptian and foreign investments, and in instigating and sustaining high levels of growth and employment opportunities. A positive response to streamlining investment procedures has been reflected in the increase in the number of newly established companies as well as expansions undertaken by companies already in operation. 
• On the non-bank financial services front, there have been major reforms in the capital market and the insurance sector has been restructured. These regulatory reforms have been initiated to allow the non-bank financial services sector to accommodate new products, and to position Egypt as the regional center for financial services.  
• The Asset Management Program has become a much broader version of the traditional privatization program. The Ministry of Investment has been responsible for supervising the implementation of restructuring programs for all state-owned enterprises (SOEs), improving their corporate governance, and overseeing and managing the transformation of ownership to the private sector in cases of privatization.  
• Egypt’s Ministry of Investment has adopted a Comprehensive Public-Private Partnership Scheme that aims to enhance the quality of services available in the country, with an array of investment opportunities. The ministry is currently supervising 46 projects in sectors such as infrastructure and public utilities in different Governorates throughout the country, at a total cost of $16 billion. The projects include various sectors, including roads, railways, ports, sewage plants, water plants, integrated development projects in Upper Egypt and the Red Sea the special economic zones north-west of the Gulf of Suez, developing technological industries, integrated civil and commercial centers throughout Egypt, developing tourism and introducing new medical cities.  
• The Ministry of Environment is currently working on the drafted law (under review and expected to be endorsed) for establishing an independent protected areas agency to enable the private sector to invest in the protected areas while conserving its natural resources. Thus upgrading the services provided in the protected areas that would result in better income generation that could be utilized for conservation of natural resources in other protected areas as well as providing job opportunities and ensuring inclusion of local community in the conservation practices within the protected areas.   
 
Reviewing the –sustainable development plan for the FY 2016/17 shows that the public sector will execute projects that represent 45 percent of total investments, while the expected participatory share of the private sector represents 55 percent of total investments in planned projects. This indicates that the achievement of the strategic goals and targets of the sustainable development strategy depends to a large extent on the effective participation of the private sector. 
 
4.4 Challenges to Implementation 
With high levels of ambition manifested in the SDS: Egypt Vision 2030, its implementation will undoubtedly face a number of challenges. The main challenges for implementation lie in the participation of all stakeholders (private, civil, and academia), financing and resource mobilization, as well as capacity building. It is worth noting that the coordination and participation efforts exerted by the Government of Egypt in pursuing its sustainable development objectives are unprecedented.  
Financing and resource mobilization pose a major challenge to accelerating SDG implementation in Egypt, and several innovative tools are being studied to overcome this challenge. A large part of the required investment will need to be financed from domestic resources. The primary responsibility to implement the sustainable development strategy rests with the Government, however financing will require mobilizing and scaling-up investment from the private sector who are expected to play a major role moving this agenda forward, and several efforts are being exerted in that regard.  
Also noteworthy, is the importance of activating SDG 17 and the target set by the United Nations in 1970 for donors to allocate 0.7 percent of their GNI as ODA. In Egypt, net ODA received (percent of gross capital formation) was 8.47 percent as of 2014. Its highest value over the past 49 years was 70.86 in 1973, while its lowest value was 1.03 in 2011. A sustainable development agenda requires aid effectiveness and partnerships between all sectors as stipulated in SDG17: Revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development. Cooperation and Development Assistance in critical, especially for priority sectors, in order for Egypt to mobilize, and redirect investment for the implementation of the SDGs and national targets. The activation and linkage of different articles in different international agreements related to Means of Implementations is also key, for example articles, 4 and Article 7, of the UNFCCC, Article 12 in the Kyoto Protocol, and Article 9 in the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. In addition to international development cooperation on financing for development, the sharing of knowledge and experiences on innovation, financing, capacity strengthening, know-how and technology transfer are crucial to the advancement of the SDGs. In that regard, South-South cooperation plays an important role, and efforts to strengthen this cooperation are key.  
The implementation and success of SDS: Egypt Vision 2030 and the SDGs, and their integrated nature, requires addressing human and institutional capacity gaps through the building of capabilities and competencies at all levels. To address these gaps, the Government is working on harnessing the demographic dividend and significant effort is being focused on investing in Egypt’s human capital, especially through education and training, and boosting decent and sustainable job creation. In this regard, specific efforts are directed at youth and women empowerment as previously illustrated. On the institutional side, creating highly qualified planners and implementers and civil servants in relevant sectors is crucial for Egypt to realize the SDGs.   
Regional disparities require broadening the scope of investment to ensure sustainability and reduce unequal access to resources. In that regard,  the Government is exerting several efforts to address regional disparities by expanding the scope of investment in regions outside the major cities (Greater Cairo and Alexandria). This will reduce the internal rates of migration from the countryside to the cities and minimize expansion of urban settlement over the agricultural area. This could bring improved services to these areas, enhancing capabilities of citizens to use appropriate technology and leading to an increase production. 
 
 
 	 

CONCLUSION 
The aim of this voluntary report was to produce the first review at the national level of the 2030 Agenda and SDGs. It also aimed at identifying the steps being taken to implement the SDGs in Egypt, as well the planned measures and reforms, and the expected challenges. It aims to contribute to the international efforts on how to address implementation and how to ensure that the SDGs go beyond a reporting exercise, to become a real policy and action agenda that enhances the wellbeing of people in Egypt and everywhere. 
 
Recent efforts by the Government of Egypt are a reflection of its priorities and commitment to help citizens achieve a life characterized by dignity, freedom, equal opportunities, inclusive growth and shared prosperity. Egypt's national agenda reflects a high level of commitment to and focus on achieving sustainable development. Egypt’s sustainable development strategy, SDS: Egypt’s Vision 2030, is the national framework through which the sustainable development agenda will be achieved in the country. Egypt has defined its sustainable development priorities in the constitution and the new sustainable development strategy integrates sustainability into existing policy processes, working on aligning sectoral objectives as well as domestic and foreign agendas, and building local ownership of the 2030 sustainable development agenda.  
Political leadership has shown strong willingness and ambition to achieving the SDGs, under the principle of common but differentiated responsibility. Stressing on the importance of facing global challenges based on the disparity in capacities and resources, as well as the national priorities and diversity of our cultures, and the need to avoid a one-size- fits all approach, development is being regarded as a fundamental human right in all countries, especially in African and other developing countries. Therefore, the path to achieving the SDGs cannot be charted in advance of the international development cooperation needed to ensure sufficient means of implementation, which is a critical factor in ensuring success in implementing the SDGs.  
 
Follow Up and review, as well as the dissemination and exchange of international experiences is an important step along this path, and will help in early detection and assessment of the process’s strengths and weaknesses. The highest possible level of coordination and cooperation on all fronts, on both the regional and international levels, will be required to foster progress in achieving this transformative agenda. In that regard, Egypt highly values the HLPF as the platform for reviewing and following-up the implementation of the SDGs through an interactive process of peer-learning and sharing of experiences and best practices, and mutually-beneficial cooperation that is driven by national priorities, and takes into account national sovereignty, with the ultimate purpose of supporting the global vision of sustainable development that leaves no one behind.
